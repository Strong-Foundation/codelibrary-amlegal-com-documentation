EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for
an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially are
odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation.
Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty
provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised Code.
Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated
by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs
between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Bryan Codified Ordinances was either
ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Bryan Codified Ordinances is indicated.

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is

(ORC 1.23)

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

competitively shall be considered responsive if said bidder's bid proposal
responds to bid specifications in all material respects and contains no

amount of the bid or otherwise give the bidder any competitive advantage. Any

      (3)    The bidder's conduct and performance on previous contracts;
      (4)    The bidder's facilities for manufacturing and/or service;

investment program. Investments of the City shall be undertaken in a manner
that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. At
no time will the safety of the portfolio’s principal investment be impaired or
jeopardized. Safety is herein defined as the certainty of receiving full par
value plus accrued interest, at the securities legal final maturity. To attain
this objective, diversification is required.
      (2)   Liquidity: The City’s investment portfolio will remain sufficiently
liquid to enable the City to meet all operating requirements. Portfolio
liquidity is defined as the ability to sell a security on a short notice near
the par value of the security. To help retain the desired liquidity, no issue
shall be purchased that is likely to have few market makers or poor market
bids. Additionally, liquidity shall be assured by keeping an adequate amount of
short term (thirty day or less) investments in the portfolio to accommodate the
cash needs of the City.
      (3)   Return on investments: The City’s investment portfolio shall be
structured with other objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the City’s investment risk
constraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio.
   
   (b)   Delegation of Authority. Management responsibility for the investment
program is hereby delegated to the Clerk-Treasurer, who shall be responsible to
the implementation of the investment program and the establishment of the
investment procedures consistent with this policy. Such procedures shall
include explicit delegation of authority to persons responsible for investment
transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as
provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the
Clerk-Treasurer. The Clerk-Treasurer shall be responsible for all transactions
undertaken and shall establish a system of control to regulate the activities
of subordinate officials.
   (c)   Authorized Financial Institutions and Brokers/Dealers. The Clerk-
Treasurer shall maintain a list of financial institutions authorized to provide
investment services. In addition, a list will also be maintained of approved
brokers/dealers who are authorized to provide investment services to the City.
These may include primary dealers or regional dealers that qualify under the
Securities & Exchange Commission Rule 15C3-1 and that are registered with the
Ohio Department of Commerce to do business in the State of Ohio. No public
deposits shall be made except in qualified depositories as established in Ohio
R.C. Chapter 135. An annual review of these lists shall be conducted by the
City. Additionally, all financial institutions and broker/dealers must provide
the following information:
      (1)   Annual financial statement, as well as most recent/quarterly
statement if available.
      (2)   Verification of regulatory history, through either the Office of
the Currency for dealer banks, or the NASD for securities firms.

of the City as described in Ohio R.C. Chapter 135.
   (e)   Diversification. The City shall diversify its investment by security
type and institution. With the exception of U.S. Treasury securities and
authorized pools, no more than fifty percent (50%) of the entity’s total
investment portfolio will be invested in a single security type or with a
single financial institution.
   (f)   Maximum Maturities. To the extent possible, the City will attempt to
match it’s investments with anticipated cash flow requirements. The City will
not directly invest in securities maturing more than two years from the date of
purchase.
   (g)   Internal Controls. The City shall establish an annual review process
of investment policies and procedures. This review will include the annual
audit conducted by the Auditor of State and/or his/her designee, as well as an
internal review for compliance with all investment policies and procedures.
This annual review process will be established by the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (h)   Review. The Clerk-Treasurer shall provide to the Mayor and/or Council

responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure

agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting

      (7)   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such services in
the municipal corporation on twenty or fewer days in a calendar year, unless
one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Municipality.
         (b)   The employee performed services at one or more presumed worksite
locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in
this state at which the employer provides services that can reasonably be
expected by the employer to last more than twenty days in a calendar year.
Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than twenty
days" if either of the following applies at the time the services commence:
            (i)   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
181.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
       (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
181.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax
Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the manner in
which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
181.051 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 36-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
   181.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (A)   The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino operator,
as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and Section
3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales agent
conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and
remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages
as provided in this section.
   (B)   If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the
internal revenue service of the amount is required by Section 6041 of the

imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located.
   (C)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall
file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the Municipality,
providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If

and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax

operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by Section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts
deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon are
immediately due and payable. The successor of the video lottery sales agent
that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent shall withhold an
amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the amounts deducted
and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until the predecessor video
lottery sales agent operator produces either of the following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;

   (I)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
181.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required
under this section.

   181.06 INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
 
   181.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
181.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
181.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
181.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
181.062 of this Chapter.

181.03 (32) of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 36-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)

APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) and (I) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
181.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
181.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
181.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal

following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
181.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
181.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)    (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who

reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to

taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to

            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (A) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (I)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section. the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (D) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B) of this section. However, a tax administrator shall
not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
181.051 of this Chapter.

that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is

"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
181.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit

the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the
computations required under Section

and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended

      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal

weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)    (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a

the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred

   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was
deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall be subject to
collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a refund of such tax

Revenue Service form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund
request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the
adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the
annual return required by this section electronically is not required to
provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
181.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
181.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
181.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document,    or
payment is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of
payment. "The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date
on the cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this Chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving the payment.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
181.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
181.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

   (A)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the

division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)   For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 36-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
   181.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 36-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
   181.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of
municipal income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be
the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (E)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (E)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (F)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (A), (B), or (C) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
   If a tax administrator violates division (F) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
   Division (F) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (A) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that
the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the
extension under division (A) of this section or failed to file for an extension
under division (C) of this section.
(Ord. 36-2015. Passed 11-2-15; Ord. 69-2023. Passed 12-18-23.)
   181.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
181.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of this
section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
181.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
         (Ord. 36-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
 
   181.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)    (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
181.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
181.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

181.03(3) of this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer
a written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right
to obtain a refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of

alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.

to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best
interests of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;

claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation

(Ord. 36-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
   181.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was

such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A

that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.

prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
181.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
181.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
181.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.

   181.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the Charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 36-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
   181.15 FRAUD.

or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or

counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,

this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the

identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity
or transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
181.15 of this Chapter,
   
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change

      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
 
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has

involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a

(Ord. 36-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
   181.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service, The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 36-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
 
   181.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.

administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.

authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to

Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in Section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to Section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 36-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
181.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the

any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section

   181.41 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in
a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not consistent,
then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the
Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code,
in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference in
this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and section 181.03 of this Chapter, the definition in this section
shall control for all uses of that term in Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter.
   As used in Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter only:
   (a)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
181.42 of this Chapter, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net operating
loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal corporation.
   (b)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (c)(23)(E)(ii) of Section
181.03 of this Chapter, means a C corporation's federal taxable income before
net operating losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal
Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (b)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (A)    Except as provided in division (b)(4)(B) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (B)    Division (b)(4)(A) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
         (C)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction
in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (e)(3)(B) of
Section
181.46 of this Chapter.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (e)(3)(b) of Section
181.46 of this Chapter.
If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division (c)(47)(B) of Section
181.03 of this Chapter, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made
the election described in division (c)(23)(E)(ii) of Section
181.03 of this Chapter, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable
income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except
guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall
not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (b) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (c)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
181.03, except that "taxpayer" does not include natural persons or entities
subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of the Revised Code. "Taxpayer"
may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons
are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (d)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and
includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (e)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of more than one taxable
year for federal income tax purposes. The tax commissioner may prescribe by
rule an appropriate period as the taxable year for a taxpayer that has had a
change of its taxable year for federal income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that
has two or more short taxable years for federal income tax purposes as the
result of a change of ownership, or for a new taxpayer that would otherwise
have no taxable year.
   (f)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
181.50 of the Revised Code.
      (Ord. 7-2018. Passed 2-19-18.)
   181.42 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in a municipal corporation and that has made the election under
Section
181.40.
   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in division (b) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of a municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the
business or profession, wherever the individual's services are performed,
excluding compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under
Section
181.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the municipal
corporation to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
a municipal corporation, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (A)    Separate accounting;
         (B)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (C)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (D)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (a) of Section
181.50 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(a) of Section
181.50 of this Chapter.
   (c)    As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (A)    The employer;
         (B)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (C)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (c)(1)(B) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)    For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title
passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
         (A)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (B)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal
corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the
real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based
upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the
commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
   (f)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under division (c)(11)(L) of Section
181.03 and division (R)(1)(d) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code by a
municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its
net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to
the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation.
In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other than the amount upon
which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the
stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (g)    When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (Ord. 7-2018. Passed 2-19-18.)
   181.43 CERTIFICATION OF AMOUNTS TO BE PAID MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS.
   (a)    On or before the last day of each month, the tax commissioner shall
certify to the director of budget and management the amount to be paid to each
municipal corporation, based on amounts reported on annual returns and
declarations of estimated tax under Sections
181.45 to
181.48 of this Chapter, less any amounts previously distributed and net of any
audit adjustments made or refunds granted by the commissioner, for the calendar
month preceding the month in which the certification is made. Not later than
the fifth day of each month, the director shall provide for payment of the
amount certified to each municipal corporation from the municipal income tax
fund, plus a pro rata share of any investment earnings accruing to the fund
since the previous payment under this section. Each municipal corporation's
share of such earnings shall equal the proportion that the municipal
corporation's certified tax payment is of the total taxes certified to all
municipal corporations in that quarter. All investment earnings on money in the
municipal income tax fund shall be credited to that fund.
   (b)    If the tax commissioner determines that the amount of tax paid by a
taxpayer and distributed to a municipal corporation under this section for a
taxable year exceeds the amount payable to that municipal corporation under
Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter after accounting for amounts remitted with the annual
return and as estimated taxes, the commissioner shall proceed according to
divisions (A) and (B) of section 5703.77 of the Revised Code.

order, or as provided in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Revised Code. The

municipal corporation and the amount of each such taxpayer's estimated payment.
   (d)    Not later than the thirty-first day of January of each year, every
municipal corporation having taxpayers that have made the election allowed
under Section
181.40 of this Chapter shall provide to the tax commissioner, in a format
prescribed by the commissioner, the name and mailing address of up to two
persons to whom the municipal corporation requests that the commissioner send
the information described in divisions (b) and (c) of this section. The
commissioner shall not provide such information to any person other than a
person who is designated to receive the information under this section and who

181.03 of this Chapter, that administers the municipal corporation's income
tax, except as may otherwise be provided by law.
   (e)   (1)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules that further govern the
terms and conditions under which tax returns filed with the commissioner under
this chapter, and any other information gained in the performance of the

corporation discovers that it has additional information in its possession that
could result in a change to a taxpayer's tax liability, the municipal
corporation may refer the taxpayer to the tax commissioner for an audit. Such
referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the commissioner and shall
include any information that forms the basis for the referral.
      (2)    Upon receipt of a referral under division (f)(1) of this section,
the commissioner shall review the referral and may conduct an audit of the
taxpayer that is the subject of the referral based on the information in the
referral and any other relevant information available to the commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in division (f) of this section shall be construed as
forming the sole basis upon which the commissioner may conduct an audit of a
taxpayer.
      (4)    Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit a municipal corporation
from filing a writ of mandamus if the municipal corporation believes that the
commissioner has violated the commissioner's fiduciary duty as the
administrator of the tax levied by the municipal corporation.

   (b)   The tax commissioner shall immediately forward to the treasurer of
state all amounts the commissioner receives pursuant to Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter. The treasurer shall credit ninety-nine and one-half per
cent of such amounts to the municipal income tax fund and the remainder to the
municipal income tax administrative fund established under section 5745.03 of
the Revised Code.
   (c)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's identification number. Each return shall be verified by a
declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   (A)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to include, with
each annual tax return, amended return, or request for refund filed with the
commissioner under Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter, copies of any relevant documents or other information.
         (B)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the tax commissioner. The department of
taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
   (d)   (1)   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (B)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (C)    An extension of time to file under division (d)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section 718.04 of the Revised Code,
the commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments
otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise
required to file annual returns.
   (e)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (f)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

   181.451 ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (a)   All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under Section
181.40 shall file any tax return or extension for filing a tax return, and

either through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by
the tax commissioner.
   (b)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make
payments electronically. For good cause shown, the commissioner may excuse the
applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (c)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns
and make payments by electronic means;
      (2)    The information taxpayers must submit when filing tax returns by
electronic means.
         (Ord. 7-2018. Passed 2-19-18.)
   181.46 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (b)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to a tax
imposed in accordance with section 718.04 of the Revised Code in that taxable
year and if the affiliated group of corporations filed a consolidated federal
income tax return with respect to that taxable year. The election is binding
for a five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the initial
election unless a change in the reporting method is required under federal law.
The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-year period
unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
division (b)(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax
commissioner. The tax commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause
shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (b)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
181.40 of this Chapter, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division
(b)(1) or (2) of Section
181.063 of this Chapter is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder
of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under Section
181.40 of this Chapter is terminated, a valid election made under this section
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (c)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (d)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (e)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (e)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
181.41 of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income"
for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that
division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (b) of Section
181.41 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (A)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.42 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (B)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.42 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (A)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in Section
181.42 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (B)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would
otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (f)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
181.42 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (g)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
181.40 to
181.45 of this Chapter or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the corporation,
an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the
taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.
(Ord. 7-2018. Passed 2-19-18.)
   181.47 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
181.40 of this Chapter fails to pay any tax as required under Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date
prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in
the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum
prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date prescribed for
its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under
Section
181.50 of this Chapter, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 7-2018. Passed 2-19-18.)
   181.48 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (b)   (1)    Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (c)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (c)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (A)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (B)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (C)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (D)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (A)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (B)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(b) of Section
181.45.
   (d)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (e) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (A)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (B)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (C)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (D)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in accordance with Section
181.43 of this Chapter.
   (e)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
(Ord. 7-2018. Passed 2-19-18.)
   181.49 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code, the following
penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter fails to make and file the return within the time
prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax commissioner,
the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars per
month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month elapsing
between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the date on
which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under this
division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a penalty
not to exceed the following:
         (A)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (B)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
181.40 of this Chapter fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid
under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to fifteen per
cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter that does not contain information upon which the
substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to be shown on
the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
181.51 of this Chapter, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any penalty imposed
under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund
from the date of the refund, may be assessed under Section
181.50 of the Revised Code without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (a) of that section.
   (b)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (c)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (d)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required
to be distributed to such municipal corporations under Section
181.43.
(Ord. 7-2018. Passed 2-19-18.)
   181.50 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (a)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter fails to file the return within the time prescribed,
files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for
the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an assessment
against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the return or
tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section 181.51 of this Chapter for the same period of time. There
shall be no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file
a return subject to assessment as required by Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter, or that files a fraudulent return. The commissioner
shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided
in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the commissioner shall
provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing
on the petition.
   (b)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (c)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (d)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (e)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (c) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (b) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (f)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
181.51 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by that
section.
(Ord. 7-2018. Passed 2-19-18.)
   181.51 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter, including assessments, shall be filed with the tax
commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or
excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by
division (a) of Section
181.50 of this Chapter. The application shall be filed in the form prescribed
by the tax commissioner.
   (b)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the

181.43 of this Chapter.
   (c)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (b) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised

assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 7-2018. Passed 2-19-18.)
   181.52 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under Section
181.40 of this Chapter and used to determine the tax due under Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the
internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax
liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner requires. The amended
return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the adjustment is agreed
upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal
income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting
therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer
intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to
amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based
on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall
notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (b)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
181.50 of this Chapter for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due
under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest. The
amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (c)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
181.51 of this Chapter, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
181.51 of this Chapter. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return.
(Ord. 7-2018. Passed 2-19-18.)
   181.53 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (a)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return
made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under
those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a duly authorized
agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this
section is required to furnish the opportunity for the commissioner, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
   (b)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
181.40 to
181.55 of this Chapter shall be open to the tax commissioner's inspection
during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six years
following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate,
unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction within that
period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The commissioner may
require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records as
the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not that person is
liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a
municipal corporation.
   (c)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (d)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

granting the credit that confirms the eligibility of the taxpayer for the
credit, the amount of the credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the
tax year to which the credit is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by a municipal corporation and taxpayer under section 718.15 or 718.151 of
the Revised Code, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such existing
agreement.

Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer without notification to
the chief of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However,
when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall
allow the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the
removal of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief, or
state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
subsection (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle
by a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible
for payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal and storage and
may reclaim the motor vehicle upon payment of those expenses or charges, and

title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of
registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon presentation of
proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of the motor vehicle
also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without retrieving the
vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.
(ORC 4513.64)
   303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   Junk motor vehicles means any motor vehicle or trailer that is
unlicensed, improperly licensed or uninsured, unless it is in a completely
closed building or meeting any three of the requirements of the Ohio R.C.
4513.63(B) to (D) that is left in the open on private property for more than
seventy-two consecutive hours with the permission of the person having the
right to the possession of the property, except if the person is operating a
junk yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio
R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12; or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or
if the property on which the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure
or regulation by any governmental authority, unless the person having the right
to possession of the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a
bona fide commercial operation.
   (b)   Any person to whom a notice is given pursuant to
303.10(d) may file a written request for a hearing before the Mayor or his
designee within the seventy-two hour period of compliance for the purpose of
defending against the charges by the City. A hearing requested pursuant to this
section shall be held as soon as practicable after the filing of the request.
Persons requesting a hearing shall be advised of the time and place of the
hearing. The scope of the hearing shall be limited to the following issues:
      (1)   Whether the person requesting the hearing and given the notice is
in charge or control of the property as charged;
      (2)   Whether the vehicle is a junk motor vehicle, inoperative,
unlicensed, improperly licensed, uninsured or meets three of the requirements
of Ohio R.C. 4513.63B-D.
   The Mayor or his designee shall then either affirm, reverse or modify the
order.
(Ord. 31-2006. Passed 5-15-06.)
   (c)   Persons may store or keep any collector’s vehicle as defined in Ohio
R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property; except that such person having
such permission shall conceal, by being housed in a garage or other suitable
structure any collector’s vehicle whether operable, inoperable, licensed or
unlicensed.
   (d)   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal or Zoning Authority, may

having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor
vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor
vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable
structure or shall be removed from the property.
   (e)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle in the open for
more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. The
fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of willful
failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty days that a
junk motor vehicle continues to be left constitutes a separate offense.
  
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor, and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
such junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the Municipality from such
disposal.

   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which

violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety

as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:

   313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the

   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
   313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or

information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the

outerbelt, except as provided in subsection (b)(12) of this section;
      (12)   Sixty-five miles per hour on all portions of freeways or
expressways without traffic control signals in urbanized areas.

limitations in subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or any declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities and

shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared
or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider whether the
evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.

if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4511.98, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall
impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the
violation under subsections (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as
applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom subsection
(d)(1)A of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) under subsection (d)(1)A. of this section and the
assessment of points under subsection (d)(4) of this section, the offender
instead may elect to attend the distracted driving safety course, as described
in Section
303.991. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall not be required to pay the fine and
shall not have the points assessed against that offender’s driver’s license if
the offender submits the written evidence to the court. This subsection does
not apply with respect to any offender in the category of offenders to whom
subsection (d)(1)B., C., or D. of this section applies.

not otherwise specified in subsection (d)(1) of this section. The court also
shall not impose a jail term or community residential sanction.

shall be assessed for a violation of subsection (a) of this section in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for the purposes of enforcing this
section unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or
physically supporting with any part of the person’s body the electronic
wireless communications device.
      (2)   A law enforcement officer who stops the operator of a motor vehicle
for a violation of subsection (a) of this section shall inform the operator
that the operator may decline a search of the operator’s electronic wireless

device;
         B.   Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to
access the device;
         C.   Obtain consent from the operator to access the device through
coercion or any other improper means. Any consent by the operator to access the

device without a warrant.

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

emergency purposes, including an emergency contact with a law enforcement
agency, hospital or health care provider, fire department, or other similar
emergency agency or entity;

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (4) or (5)

plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to

issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.
   (d)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (a) or (b) hereof, is guilty of a

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

         A.   That the person has a physical impairment that makes use of an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical;
         B.   Whether the physical impairment is temporary, permanent or
reasonably expected to be permanent;
         C.   If the physical impairment is temporary, how long the physical
impairment is expected to make the use of an occupant restraining device
impossible or impractical.
      (4)   Subsections (b)(1) and (3) of this section do not apply to a person
who has registered with the Registrar of Motor Vehicles in accordance with
subsection (c)(5) of this section.
      (5)   A person who has received an affidavit under subsection (c)(3) of
this section stating that the person has a permanent or reasonably expected to
be permanent physical impairment that makes use of an occupant restraining
device impossible or impracticable may register with the Registrar attesting to
that fact. Upon such registration, the Registrar shall make that information
available in the law enforcement automated data system. A person included in
the database under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not required to have
the affidavit obtained in accordance with subsection (c)(3) of this section in
their possession while operating or occupying an automobile.
      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of subsection (c)(3) or (4) of this section is immune from civil
liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant
restraining device unless the physician or chiropractor, in issuing the
affidavit, acted in a manner that constituted willful, wanton or reckless
misconduct.
      (7)   The Registrar shall adopt rules in accordance with Ohio R.C.
Chapter 119, establishing a process for a person to be included in the database
under subsection (c)(5) of this section. The information provided and included
in the database under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not a public record
subject to inspection or copying under Ohio R.C. 149.43.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation
of that nature has been or is being committed.

person to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant
restraining device in violation of subsection (b)(1) or (3) or the failure of a
person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2) of this
section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be
fined thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
      (3)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

   (a)    A person is subject to misdemeanor prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.

State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

(ORC 2901.11)
   501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a mentally retarded,
developmentally disabled, or physically impaired child under twenty-one years
of age shall not begin to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
(ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.

subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."

purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.

act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.

only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.

a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.

when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;

conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.

division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug

   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor     Maximum Fine  
First degree            $5000.00
Second degree           4000.00
Third degree            3000.00

Minor misdemeanor not
specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section

   545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
 545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
 545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,

 545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

a school operated by a board of education or for which the State Board of
Education prescribes minimum standards under Ohio R.C. 3301.07, the court shall
impose upon the offender a class four suspension of the offender's probationary
driver's license, restricted license, driver's license, commercial driver's
license, temporary instruction permit, or probationary commercial driver's
license that then is in effect from the range specified in division (A)(4) of
Ohio R.C. 4510.02 and shall deny the offender the issuance of any permit or
license of that type during the period of the suspension.

four suspension of the nonresident operating privilege of the offender from the

one of the types of licenses, permits, or privileges specified in subsection
(d)(1) of this section or deny the issuance of one of the temporary instruction
permits specified in that subsection, the court in its discretion may choose
not to impose the suspension, revocation, or denial required in that
subsection, but the court, in its discretion, instead may require the offender
to perform community service for a number of hours determined by the court.
   (e)    As used in this section, "object that is indistinguishable from a
firearm" means an object made, constructed, or altered so that, to a reasonable

   (g)   In addition to the television signals set forth in subsection (f)
hereof the grantee shall carry a minimum of five FM radio stations and WBNO-FM.
   (h)   Whereas local programming is of interest to the City, voluntary
efforts to provide a local origination programming channel and the amount of
time thereof will be considered in awarding the franchise.
   In addition, the system shall be equipped with an all channel, emergency
alert system.
   (i)   The grantee, whenever it is necessary to interrupt service over the
broadband telecommunications network for the purpose of network maintenance,
alteration or repair, shall do so at such time as will cause the least amount
of inconvenience to his subscribers, and unless such interruption is unforeseen
and immediately necessary, he shall give reasonable notice thereof to the
affected subscribers.
   (j)   The grantee shall maintain an office within the City limits which
shall be open during all usual business hours, have a listed telephone number
and be so operated that complaints and requests for repairs or adjustments may
be received at any time.
   (k)   The grantee shall provide "same day service" response, seven days a
week for all complaints and requests for repairs or adjustments received prior
to 2:00 p.m. each day. In no event shall the response time for calls received
subsequent to 2:00 p.m. exceed twenty-four hours.
   (l)   Upon failing to correct a service deficiency within twenty-four hours,
the grantee shall credit one-thirtieth of the monthly charge for "basic
service" and "additional service" to each subscriber for each twenty-four hours
or fraction thereof after the first twenty-four hours following report of loss
of service to the grantee, except to the extent that restoration of service is
prevented by strike, injunction or other cause beyond the control of the
grantee. The grantee shall maintain a log, which shall be filed annually with
the City as set forth in Section
711.20, of such reports and of the time of restoration of service.
(Ord. 29-1972. Passed 3-5-73.)
   711.14 NETWORK TECHNICAL STANDARDS.
   A grantee of a franchise hereunder shall install a broadband
telecommunication network in the City, meeting the technical standards adopted
by the Federal Communications Commission, in their Third Report and Order, to
the extent that such Federal standards are more stringent than these proposed
by the City.
   (a)   Definitions.
      (1)   "Cable television channel" means a frequency band 6MHz in width
within which a standard television broadcast signal is delivered by cable to a
subscriber terminal.
      (2)   "Class I cable television channel" means a signaling path provided
by a cable television system to relay to subsecriber terminals television
broadcast programs that are received off-the-air or are obtained by microwave
or by direct connection to a television broadcast station.
      (3)   "Class II cable television channel" means a signaling path provided
by a cable television system to deliver to subscriber terminals television
signals that are intended for reception by a television broadcast receiver
without the use of an auxiliary decoding device and which signals are not
involved in a broadcast transmission path.
      (4)   "Class III cable television channel" means a signaling path
provided by a cable television system to deliver to subscriber terminals
signals that are intended for reception by equipment other than a television
broadcast receiver or by a television broadcast receiver only when used with
auxiliary decoding equipment.
      (5)   "Class IV cable television channel" means a signaling path provided
by a cable television system to transmit signals of any type from a subscriber
terminal to another point in the cable television system.
      (6)   "Discrete cable television channel" means a signaling path provided
by a cable television system to transmit signals of any type to specified
subscriber terminals within the cable television system.
      (7)   "Channel frequency response" means within a cable television
channel, the relationship as measured at a subscriber terminal between
amplitude and frequency of a constant-amplitude input signal.
      (8)   "Network noise" means the combination of undesired and fluctuating
disturbances within a cable television channel, exclusive of undesired signals
of discrete frequency which degrade the reproduction of the desired signal and
which are due to modulation processes, thermal effects and other noise
producing effects, not including hum. Network noise is specified in terms of
its rms voltage or its mean power level as measured in a 4MHz above the lower
channel boundary of a broadband telecommunications network.
      (9)   "Subscriber terminal" means the broadband telecommunications
network 75 ohm cable terminal to which the subscriber's equipment is connected.
Separate terminals may be provided for delivery of cable television signals, FM
broadcasts or other signals of differing classifications.

signal during the transmission of synchronizing pulses.
      (12)   "BTN network channel capacity" means the highest total number of
cable television channels on which television signals from separate sources may
be delivered downstream simultaneously to every subscriber in the network. The
network may have additional channel capacity for specialized or discrete
purposes, but the technical performance specified shall not be materially
degraded thereby.

comply with these criteria.
      (2)   The grantee shall file with the Clerk-Treasurer a statement of the
network channel capacity, listing the cable television channels which that
network delivers to its CATV subscribers, and the television station or
stations whose signals are delivered on each channel of the network under
normal operating conditions. When television stations are to be deleted or
added the Clerk-Treasurer and all subscribers shall be notified in writing
thirty days prior to the date of such deletion or addition.
      (3)   The grantee shall conduct, as set forth by the FCC in their Third
Report and Order, complete performance tests of that network at least once each
calendar year, at intervals not to exceed fourteen months and shall file with
the Clerk-Treasurer a certificate detailing the test standards and the results
of such tests. The performance tests will be directed at determining the extent
to which the network complies with the technical standards set forth in this
section, and at the discretion of the City shall be conducted in the presence
of a technical representative appointed by the City. The tests shall be made on
each cable television channel in the network, and shall include measurements
made at least two trunk extremities and three taps selected at random at least
one of which is representative of a terminal most distant from the network
input in terms of cable distance. A statement of the qualifications of the
person performing the test and a description of instruments and procedures used
shall be attached to the test results filed with the Clerk-Treasurer.
      (4)   After reviewing the certificates of compliance required in
subsection (b)(3) hereof the City may require that certain additional
measurements be made, or that clarifying explanation be supplied, as necessary
to correct defective certificates.
   (c)   Technical Standards. The following requirements apply to the broadband
telecommunications network performance for Class I, Class II and Discrete 6MHz
Video Cable Television Channels as measured at any equivalent subscriber
terminal with a matched termination and to each of the cable television
channels in which signals picked off the air are delivered to such terminals.
Such measurements shall not include the receiver converter if such is required
at the customer's receiver for any of the channels of required carriage.
      (1)   The frequency boundaries of cable television channels delivered to
subscriber terminals shall conform to those set forth in FCC Rules, Section
73.603(a). All local channels shall be carried on the network synchronously,

      (2)   The frequency of the visual carriers shall be maintained 1.25 MHz +
25 KHz above the lower boundary of the cable television channel, up to the
receiving terminals, exclusive of any receiver attachments, such as channel
converters, except for the local VHF channels which shall be carried
synchronously to the extent it is technically feasible.
      (3)   The frequency of the aural carrier shall be 4.5 MHz + 1 KHz above
the frequency of the visual carrier, except where monochrome signal origination
occurs within the system, under which conditions, the tolerance shall be + 5
KHz. All color local origination channels shall have aural-visual separation +
1KHz from 4.5MHz.
      (4)   The visual signal level at the picture carrier frequency on each
channel shall not be less than 1,000 UV, microvolts, across a 75-ohms
terminating impedance and shall be maintained within the following limits over
the entire ambient temperature range of minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit to +120
degrees Fahrenheit and with variations in supply voltages from 105 to 130

      (11)   All echos originating within the network shall meet the
nonvisibility criteria developed by P. Mertz of the Bell Telephone Company,
i.e., shall not be greater than minus 36 db for echos dispersed more than 2
micro seconds. For shorter term dispersed echos, the network, including head-
end terminal, shall follow the Mertz Curve, merging to a K pulse deformation
not exceeding four percent (4%) of the total system. This latter measurement
shall not include the K response of the test modulator and demodulator (if

800 and 810 of the National Electrical Code, current edition.
      (16)   Notwithstanding the fact that the network may be in compliance
with all the standards set forth herein, the City may require a higher level of
performance in any area to resolve signal quality or interference problems.
   (d)    distribute signals by using multiple cable techniques or specialized
receiving devices, which, because of the basic design, cannot comply with one
or more of the technical standards set forth in subsection (c)(11) hereof, he
may be permitted to operate with such equipment provided that an adequate
showing is made which establishes that the subscribers are provided an
equivalent quality of service. The City expects full technical proof of
equivalent performance before it can judge whether such an alternate approach
would be acceptable.
      (Ord. 29-1972. Passed 3-5-73.)
   711.15 MEASUREMENTS.
   (a)   Measurements made to demonstrate conformity with the performance
requirements set forth in these technical standards shall be made under
conditions which reflect network performance during normal operations,
including the effect of any present or future microwave relay operated in the
Community Antenna Relay Service (CARS) intervening between pickup antenna and
the broadband telecommunication network and including the effects of any
microwave local distribution service which may be a part of the network.
   Special signals inserted in a cable television channel for measurement
purposes should be operated at levels approximating those used for normal
operation. Pilot tones, auxiliary signals, and nontelevision signals normally
carried on the network should be operated at normal levels. The following test
procedures are included as a guide. There are several recognized and
technically acceptable methods for performing many of the measurements, the
technique and equipment used in each case, if different than those set forth
herein shall be fully described in the annual certification to the City.
   (b)   When it may be necessary to remove the television signal normally
carried on a cable television channel in order to facilitate a performance
measurement, it will be permissible to disconnect the antenna which serves the
channel under measurement and to substitute therefor a matching resistance
termination. Other inputs should be connected to maintain the equivalent to, or
special test signals on, other channels to ascertain network performance.
   (c)   As may be necessary to ensure satisfactory service to a subscriber,
the City may require additional tests to demonstrate network performance or may
specify the use of different test procedures.
   (d)   Network frequency response measurements may be made with a calibrated
signal generator, variable attenuator and a frequency selective voltmeter. All
TV signals except for ALC, AGC, or ASC pilot carriers may be disconnected
during this test. With all automatic gain control amplifiers in the section
under test set to their normal operating mode, the signal generator shall be
connected to the input to the telecommunications network and set for a cw
signal at the desired frequency and level normally present at that frequency
and location. With the meter and variable attenuator connected in series to the
subscriber terminal under tests, the signal level shall be measured and
recorded. Measurements shall then be made in a similar manner for all
frequencies at the levels normally carried on the network.
   (e)   Network noise may be measured using a frequency-selective voltmeter,
field strength meter which has been suitably calibrated to indicate rms noise
or average power level and which has a known bandwidth. With the network
operating at normal levels and with a properly matched resistive termination
substituted for the antenna, noise power indications at the subscriber terminal
are taken in successive increments of frequency equal to the bandwidth of the
frequency-selective voltmeter, summing the power indications to obtain the
total noise power present over a 4MHz band centered with the cable television
channel, or equivalent noise summation technique. If an amplifier is inserted
between the frequency-selective voltmeter and the subscriber terminal in order
to facilitate this measurement, it should be a bandwidth of a least 4MHz and
appropriate corrections must be made to account for its gain.
   (f)   The amplitude of discrete frequency interfering signals within a cable
television channel may be determined with either a spectrum analyzer or with a
frequency-selective voltmeter, field strength meter, or other suitable
instruments, which instruments have been calibrated for adequate accuracy.
   (g)   The terminal isolation between any two terminals in the network may be
measured by applying a signal of known amplitude to one and measuring the
amplitude of that signal at the other terminal. The frequency of the signal
should be close to the midfrequency of the channel being tested. This test is
to be performed with 150 drop lead, equivalent network if desired, connected to
each output spigot of the customer tap port.
   (h)   Radiation measurements may be made utilizing a frequency-selective
voltmeter calibrated for adequate accuracy and a tuneable half-wave dipole
antenna, horizontal polarized. The distance and height above ground of the
measurements shall be in accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the
Federal Communications Commission, Volume 11, Part 15 Subpart D, for cable
television systems.
   (i)   The network cross-modulation measurement may be performed using a
calibrated signal generator having controllable modulation, a detector and an
oscilloscope. After connecting the signal generator to the lowest standard VHF
frequency input terminal of the Head End signal combiner, its output shall be
set for an unmodulated signal identical in frequency and level to that of the
signal normally present at that point. The signals of all other channels
normally carried on the network shall be fed into the combiner at their normal
levels. After connecting the field strength meter to the subscriber terminus,
it shall be tuned to the video carrier frequency of the channel under tests and
with the oscilloscope, the modulation level may be read directly from the
scope.
   (j)   The network hum modulation may be measured at each video carrier
frequency on the network using a calibrated signal generator, a detector and an
oscilloscope. The signal generator shall be connected, the level and frequency
adjusted and all other channels set at their normal levels. With the detector
and oscilloscopes connected to the subscriber terminus, the average level of
the detected signal and the peak-to-peak A C hum will be indicated on the
oscilloscope. The percent of the average level of the detected signal to one-
half the indicated peak-to-peak A C hum.
   (k)   All actual recorded values observed as a result of the various tests
shall be recorded and submitted to the City in accordance with the provisions
of this section.
      (1)   Reverse signal capability (duplex network). The grantee shall
provide in original construction a duplex network capable of reverse direction
signals from each and all drops. Such carriage capability shall be at least in
accordance with the requirements of the Federal Communications Commission's
Third Report and Order.
      (2)   Maintenance. The grantee shall retain a sufficient number of
technically qualified personnel to maintain the network at the quality
specified. Sufficient personnel shall also be either on duty or on call during
all hours of each day to maintain service at all times.
         (Ord. 29-1972. Passed 3-5-73.)
   711.16 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (a)   All construction practices shall be in accordance with standard
utilities practices as detailed in the Edison Electrical Institute Publication

   719.01 COMPLIANCE, PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person, firm, association or corporation shall commence drilling a well
for oil and/or gas within the corporate limits of the City until such time as
the person, firm, association or corporation has complied with all provisions
of this chapter and permission has been granted by Council to the person, firm,
association or corporation by permit authorized by Council and signed by the
Mayor and Clerk-Treasurer.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.02 PERMIT APPLICATION; FEE; BOND.
   Any person, firm, association or corporation desiring to drill a well for
oil and/or gas within the corporate limits of the City shall make application
for a permit to the Clerk-Treasurer by 5 p.m. Friday prior to any regular
meeting of Council. All requests for permits must be complete at that time. A
fee of one thousand dollars ($1,000) shall be paid to the Clerk-Treasurer at
the time such application is filed, for defraying the expenses of
administration and enforcement of regulations concerning drilling oil and/or
gas wells within the City and to defray the expenses of inspecting oil and/or
gas well sites prior to and during drilling, during production and at the time
such wells are pulled and plugged. No refund of any part of a permit fee shall
be made to any permit holder for a dry hole or for failure to exercise the
privilege to drill upon the site covered by the permit.
   Any person, firm, association or corporation at the time of application
shall also file with the Clerk-Treasurer a surety bond with liability on the
bond conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of this chapter until the
time of completion of drilling, plugging or abandonment of such well or wells.
The bond shall be three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) for one well or in
lieu of a bond for each well.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64; Adopting Ordinance.)
   719.03 CONSENT OF PROPERTY OWNERS REQUIRED FOR PERMIT; CONDITIONS; LEASED OR
UNITIZED PROPERTY.
   (a)   All applications for a permit to drill for oil and/or gas in the City
shall be accompanied by consents in writing of the owners of fifty-one percent
(51%) or more of the front footage of real estate which is located within a
radius of 200 feet from a proposed drilling site, and such consents shall
plainly state that the persons whose signatures are affixed thereto do thereby
give their consent to the drilling of a well for oil and/or gas on the site as
proposed in the application for a drilling permit. However, if the proposed
site for a well is located 200 feet or more from any abutting property, then
regardless of the use to which the abutting property may be put, the assenting
signatures herein provided for shall not be required. Measurement for
determination of such distance shall be made from the exact center of the
location at which it is contemplated the well shall be drilled. If any portion
of a lot or tract of real estate is less than 200 feet from the center of the
location where a well is to be drilled, such lot or tract shall be considered
abutting property within the meaning of this section.
   (b)   In the event, however, that the owner of any property abutting a
proposed well site has:
      (1)   Leased his property for drilling for oil and/or gas, or
      (2)   Signed and filed an application for a permit to drill for oil and/
or gas on his property, or his lessee, contractor or agent has signed and filed
such application, or
      (3)   Signed and delivered a written assent under this section to an
application for a permit to drill a well for oil and/or gas or
      (4)   Unitized his property by entering into a community lease or
agreement for drilling a well for oil and/or gas, and if the well to which he
has assented or which is to be drilled under such community lease or agreement
is to be located nearer to his property than the well or proposed well site
first abovementioned in subsection (a) hereof.
   Then such owner shall not be permitted to object but shall be deemed to have
given his written assent under the provisions of this section to drilling a
well for oil and/or gas on the proposed well site first mentioned.
   However, any owner who has unitized his property by entering into a
community lease or agreement as set forth in subsection (b)(4) hereof shall not
share in any adjacent well production because of conflicting lease interests of
such real estate caused by such real estate being in more than one unitized
area. It is the express intent of this provision to prohibit an owner of
property from unitizing identical property under more than one community lease
or agreement.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.04 DRILLING NEAR BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES; WAIVER; VACATION.
   No drilling shall be permitted for oil and/or gas wells within 200 feet of
any building or structure of any nature unless written waivers as hereinafter
provided accompany an application for a drilling permit.
   (a)   The owners or occupants of any buildings or structures of any nature
may consent to drilling for oil and/or gas closer than 100 feet to such
buildings or structures, but in such cases, Council shall consider special
features affecting the application for a drilling permit, such as topographical
conditions, nature of occupancy and proximity of buildings on the abutting
property and facilities available at Fire Departments to cope with controlling
liquid fires and such other matters that Council deems relevant to the
application. Should Council, upon considering such special features, find that
an undue hazard is created, then irrespective of waivers being provided as
called for in this section, Council may refuse to issue a permit to drill and
the denial of the permit and the undue hazard created shall be recorded in the
minutes of Council by the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (b)   Where the owners or occupants of any buildings or structures which are
closer than 200 feet to a proposed drilling site have at any time waived in
writing the distance requirement provided for in this section for any proposed
drilling site which was closer than 200 feet to such buildings or structures,
then such property owners shall be deemed to have waived the distance
requirement provided for in this section down to the same distance that such
part waived for the other proposed drilling site, or to the distance that a
well was actually drilled, whichever is smaller.
   (c)   Any owners or occupants of any buildings or structures who actually
reside within 100 feet of a proposed drilling site must vacate, cause to vacate
and assure the continued vacation of such buildings or structures during
drilling operations. A written agreement must be provided with the application
for a drilling permit in such cases wherein the owners or occupants agree to
vacate, cause to vacate and assure continued vacation of any buildings or
structures located closer than 100 feet to a proposed drilling site.
   All distances as set forth in this section shall be those distances as
measured from the exact center of a proposed drilling site.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.05 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   Upon vote by a majority of Council that an application for a permit be
granted, the Clerk-Treasurer shall issue the permit applied for, provided
however that prior to issuance, the Clerk-Treasurer shall be provided with a
policy or a certificate of insurance, covering the applicant's liability for
property damage in an amount of not less than three hundred thousand dollars
($300,000) and the applicant's liability for personal injury in an amount of
not less than three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000), which insurance policy
or policies must be maintained for such period of time as drilling is in
process, the well is in operation or is producing oil and/or gas, or until such
well is pulled and plugged as hereinafter provided. Such insurance policies and
the coverages thereunder must be to the complete satisfaction of Council and
such policies may be rejected by Council for any valid reason, and such
rejection of the insurance policies by Council shall serve to stay the the
granting of a permit heretofore approved by them until such time as an
insurance policy providing coverage entirely satisfactory to Council has been
provided by the applicant.
   All applicants shall be required to prove that insurance policies required
by this section provide coverage where this is a "blowout" in the drilling of
an oil and/or gas well, and also cratering liability coverage.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.06 ROTARY DRILLING EQUIPMENT.
   The drilling preparation used in wells drilled with rotary equipment shall
be capable of sealing off each oil, gas, brine or fresh water stratum above the
producing horizon or objective formation and shall be capable of preventing
blowouts and flows of salt or fresh water, in accordance with good oil field
practice.
   Rotary tools shall have the innermost string of casing equipped with a
blowout preventer properly installed and tested prior to drilling into any
formation likely to contain oil or gas.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.07 CABLE TOOLS.
   Wells drilled with cable tools shall have the innermost string of casing
equipped with a high pressure mastergate valve and control head and an oil
saver, securely anchored by concrete, prior to drilling into any formation
likely to contain oil or gas.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.08 CREW TRAINING; EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE.

accordance with good oil field practice to protect fresh water wells from salt
water pollution.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.10 FENCES; WELL PUMP MOTORS.
   A permittee shall maintain a fence around the drilling site in accordance
with good oil field practice. Should a well be a producer, a permittee shall,
on completion of the well, construct a ten-foot cyclone fence around the well
pump an shall thereafter maintain the fence and keep it in a good state of
repair.
   All well pumps shall be operated by electric motors only.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.11 DRAINING INTO SEWERS PROHIBITED.
   No waste, sludge, water or effluent or any type where an oil and/or gas well
is being drilled shall in any manner be emptied or drained into any storm or
sanitary sewer of the City.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.12 DRILLING DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS ONLY.
   No permittee shall in any instance be permitted to drill into any formation
likely to contain oil or gas except during the daylight hours. Daylight hours
for the purpose of this section shall be defined as that time between sunrise
and sunset.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.13 PLOT PLAN; STORAGE TANK LOCATION; PIPELINES.
   All tanks for oil storage shall be erected and maintained outside the
corporate limits of the City. In no instance shall storage tanks be permitted
closer than 200 feet to any building of any type within the corporate limits of
the City.
   Council may in its discretion allow any permittee to lay the pipeline from
its drilling site to its oil tank storage area on public property. A plot must
be submitted at the time application for a drilling permit is made showing
clearly the location of the drilling site, location of the oil tank storage
area and location of the pipeline between the drilling site and oil tank
storage area. Council must approve the location of the line and may in its
absolute discretion require a change of route for the pipeline, in whole or in
part.
   Council may require the permittee, prior to actual laying of a pipeline, to
deposit with the Clerk-Treasurer a sum of money considered adequate to restore
all property in the path of the pipeline to the same condition in which it was
prior to laying such pipeline. The cost of laying and maintaining such pipeline
shall be borne entirely by the permittee. Upon restoring property in the path
of the pipeline to the condition in which it was prior to laying the pipeline,
the deposit shall be returned to the permittee on order of Council. If any
portion of the job of restoring the property to its proper condition is
considered inadequate, Council may, on notice to the permittee of its failure,
proceed to have the work done and use the deposit to pay any expense of any
type incurred in restoring such property to its original condition.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.14 TRACKING MUD; CLEANING STREETS; PERMIT REVOCATION.
   All permittees shall use care at a drilling site to keep the area around the
drilling site free of mud which may be carried onto the public streets by any
vehicle or other equipment used at the drilling site. Should any mud be carried
on public streets from a drilling site, the permittee may be required to clean
up the streets to the satisfaction of the Mayor. The Mayor shall have authority
to request a permittee to take specific steps to reduce mud at a given
location. Failure of a permittee to clean up the public streets to the
satisfaction of the Mayor or failure to take specific steps to reduce mud at a
given location as requested by the Mayor shall be grounds for revocation of a
permit and shall further be subject to the penalty in Section 719.99.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.15 MAP TO ACCOMPANY APPLICATION.
   Accompanying each application for a drilling permit, there shall be a map of
the area involved in the application drawn to scale and showing thereon:
   (a)   The lot lines of all properties within 200 feet of the proposed well

   719.17 EXCEPTIONS.
   A request for an exception to any section of this chapter shall be made in
writing to the Clerk-Treasurer. Such requests shall be studied by Council, and
where Council feels that special conditions warrant granting of an exception,
the Clerk-Treasurer shall be notified of the decision. Granting or refusal to
grant an exception to any of the sections of this chapter shall rest within the
sole and absolute discretion of Council.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.18 RIGHT OF ENTRY; PERMIT REVOCATION.
   Council or its duly authorized representative shall have the authority at
any time to enter upon property where a drilling site is contemplated, upon
property where a well is in the process of being drilled or upon a producing
well site for the purpose of inspecting the site, equipment and all other
things necessary to assure compliance with this chapter.
   Failure to comply with any provision of this chapter shall be grounds to
refuse to issue a permit to drill or shall be grounds to revoke a permit
already issued by Council. Revocation of a permit shall remove all right of the
permittee to drill for oil and/or gas until such time as permittee takes steps
to come into compliance with this chapter. Operations carried on by the
permittee after revocation of a permit shall constitute a violation of this
section and be punishable under Section
719.99.
(Ord. 36-1964. Passed 10-5-64.)
   719.19 AFFIDAVITS; FALSE STATEMENTS.
   Any applicant for a permit shall be required to file with the application an
affidavit stating that the applicant has complied with all conditions of this
chapter or setting forth any exceptions thereto. Any false statement in the
affidavit shall be grounds to refuse to issue a permit to drill or shall be

theft, loss or damage to converters or other equipment provided to the
Subscriber by the Franchisee, provided, however, to the extent it can be shown

watertightness of the sewer when completed. The inlet end of the upstream and
downstream cleanouts shall be closed with a watertight bulkhead, and the sewer
along with the upstream cleanout shall be filled with water until the elevation
of the water in the upstream cleanout is two feet higher than the top of the
pipe, or two feet above the existing ground water in the trench, whichever is
the higher elevation. The exfiltration will be determined by measuring the
amount of water required to maintain the above stated water elevation for
period of one hour from the start of the test. To reduce the amount of
absorption the entire length of section to be tested may be filled and
maintained full of water for a period of approximately twenty-four hours prior
to the start of the test.
 
   (c)   The allowable leakage is based on a maximum difference in elevation of
eight feet between the level of water at the upper cleanout and the invert of

exceeds eight feet, the allowable leakage shall be increased five percent (5%)
for each one foot in excess of eight feet.
 
   (d)   Immediately after the completion of the exfiltration test, the line
shall be drained and the infiltration, under existing ground conditions, shall
be measured within three hours by means of a weir located in the downstream
manhole.
 
   (e)   It is further understood that, if the leakage does not come within the
limits specified, the contractor will be required to do such work as may be
necessary in order to insure conformance even to the extent of reconstruction
of the defective section or sections.

From the standpoint of source, it may be a combination of the liquid and water-
carried wastes from residences, commercial buildings, industries and
institutions, together with any ground water, surface water, and storm water
that may be present.
      (47)   "Wastewater treatment plant" or "WWTP" means that portion of the
wastewater treatment works required to treat wastewater and dispose of the
effluent.
      (48)   "Wastewater treatment works" or "works" means the structures,
equipment, parcels of land, easements and processes required to collect, carry
away and treat wastewater and dispose of the effluent of the sewer users.
Wastewater treatment works shall include sanitary sewers and intercepting
sewers, but shall not include storm sewers.

either continuously or intermittently.
         (Ord. 66-1987. Passed 12-7-87.)
   927.02 CONTROL OF WASTEWATER DISCHARGES.
   (a)   Normal Concentrations of Wastes.
      (1)   Charges for waste treatment pursuant to Section
927.05(c) shall apply to wastes not exceeding normal concentrations as follows:
         A. BOD - 260 milligrams per liter;
         B. Suspended solids - 260 milligrams per liter;
         C. Phosphorus - 7 milligrams per liter.
      (2)   Applicable concentrations shall be based on average concentrations,
weighted in proportion to volume of flow, determined during each billing period
by the most practicable method possible. Should the average concentration of
any constituent exceed the normal concentration provided in this section, a
user charge - extra strength surcharge shall be collected by the City as
subsequently outlined in Section
927.05.
   (b)   Authority for Control of Wastewater Discharges. If any wastes are
discharged, or are proposed to be discharged, to the wastewater treatment works
which contain pollutants in excess of normal concentrations as defined above
and/or possess characteristics which, in the judgment of the City, may have a
deleterious effect upon the wastewater treatment works or receiving waters,
including violation of applicable NPDES permit, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the City shall:
      (1)   Reject the wastes; or
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the wastewater treatment works; and/or
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)   Require payment of surcharges as provided previously to cover the
added cost of handling and treating the wastes.
   Roof drains, foundation drains and all other clear water connections to the
sanitary sewers are prohibited.
   (c)   Industrial Wastes. Refer to Chapter
933.
   (d) Submission of Basic Data. Within ninety days after passage of this
chapter, each person whose operation entails the discharge of industrial wastes
to a public sewer shall prepare and file with the City, a written statement
setting forth the nature of the operation contemplated or presently carried on,
the amount and source of water required for use, the proposed point of
discharge of said wastes into the waterwater collection system of the City, the
estimated amount to be so discharged and a fair statement setting forth the
expected bacterial, physical, chemical and other known characteristics of such
wastes. Within a reasonable time of receipt of such statement, it shall be the
duty of the City to make an order stating such minimum restrictions as in the
judgment of the City may be necessary to adequately guard against unlawful uses
of the wastewater system. When it can be demonstrated that circumstances exist
which would create an unreasonable burden on the person to comply with this
time schedule, a request for extension of time may be presented for
consideration of the City. All requests for extension of time shall be
submitted in writing, stating the reasons for such a request. Under no
circumstances shall the extension of time exceed sixty days after approval of
the extension by the City.
   (e) Oil and Grease.
      (1)    If oils and grease are biodegradable and in a physical state that
does not cause clogging or undue maintenance problems in the wastewater
facilities, the discharge of these substances can be accepted in a wastewater
treatment system. Animal and vegetable oils and greases (polar substances) are
readily degradable in aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment systems
provided that the physical states of the oils and grease do not prevent the
necessary contact with the biological suspensions responsible for treatment.
However, oils and grease of mineral origin (primarily nonpolar substances) are
essentially nonbiodegradable either in aerobic or anaerobic processes and
should be removed from industrial wastes to the maximum degree practical before
discharge. The discharge of these oils and greases of mineral origin shall be
limited to the regulation of the City. Grease separators are required for all
meat packing plants and on building sewers serving hotels, restaurants, and
institutions in which large numbers of meals are served.
      (2)    However, the use of garbage grinders precludes the use of gravity
grease separators. Flammmable waste and grit intercepting facilities must be
provided on all building sewers from garages, filling stations, cleaning
establishments and other concerns using volatile oils or solvents. Special
pretreatment methods are required for the removal of soluble cutting oils. All
grease and oil removal facilities must be approved by the City.
   (f) Wastewater Volume Determination.
      (1)    In all cases, volume to be charged for shall be one hundred
percent (100%) of the volume that is recorded on the meters used to measure
water from the water system of the City, unless the user is supplied with water
from a source other than the water system of the City or unless a substantial
volume of water supplied to the user is not discharged to the wastewater
treatment works, in which case, the volume of water discharged to the
wastewater treatment works shall be determined by a meter installed to measure
wastewater discharged, or by other means approved by the City. In the event a
sewer user shall elect at his own cost and expense to install a meter to
register the exact volume of wastewater that enters the wastewater treatment
works, the volume to be charged for such metered shall be based upon one
hundred percent (100%) of the actual meter reading and the rates established by
the City shall apply. Meters installed other than the meter used to record
consumption from the water system of the City shall be approved by the City and
installed and maintained at the expense of the user.
      (2)   Wastewater meters may be tested by the City for accuracy at the
expense of the owner once each year.
      (3)   The City shall have the authority to remove the meter on its
initiative to undertake to test and correct any meter which in its judgment is
registering incorrectly without the consent of the owner. Should the wastewater
meter be found to be registering outside of the accuracy of the specifications
published for such meter, the owner shall bear the cost for shipping, testing,
repair and replacement. Should the wastewater meter be found to be registering
within the accuracy of the specifications published for such meter, the City
shall bear the cost for shipping, testing, repair and replacement. During the
period the meter is not in service, the volume of wastewater discharged shall
be determined by the Director.
   (g)   Sampling and Monitoring.
      (1)   Industrial wastes discharged to the wastewater treatment works
shall be subject to periodic inspection with a determination of character and
concentration of such wastes. The determination shall be made as often as may
be deemed necessary by the City. The user shall be responsible for the cost of
collection and testing of the aforementioned samples.
      (2)   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative
of the composition of the wastes. The sampling shall preferably be accomplished
by the use of automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting composite
samples. Every care shall be exercised in the collection of samples to insure
their preservation in a state comparable to that at the time the sample was
taken.
   (h)   Control Manhole. When required by the City, a user shall install one
or more suitable structures, together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances, in the building sewer(s) to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. Such structure(s), when required, shall be
accessible and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans
approved by the City. The structure(s) and appurtenances shall be installed by
the user at its expense and shall be maintained by the user so as to be safe
and accessible at all times.
   (i)   Testing.
      (1)   All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of
wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for Examination of
Water and Wastewater", published by the American Public Health Association,
unless such standards conflict with regulations promulgated by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency under 40 CFR 136 - "Guidelines Establishing
Test Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants", in which case, the regulations
promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency shall govern. Sampling
methods, location, times, duration and frequencies shall be determined on an
individual basis subject to approval by the City or its duly authorized
representative.
      (2)   All costs incident to sampling and analyses shall be borne by the
user. Such costs incurred by the City on behalf of the user shall be billed
annually to the user, based on the actual cost to the City, plus reasonable
overhead. Such billing shall be billed with, and be considered a part of, the
sewer service charge for the period billed.
   (j)   Discharge of Wastes to Storm Sewers. Wastes shall not be discharged
into a storm sewer unless the waste is of such character as would permit the
waste to be discharged directly to the body of water to which the storm sewer
discharges and be in compliance with all criteria and standards of discharge
established by regulatory agencies.
   (k)   Substances Limited. The following described substances, materials,
waters or wastes shall be limited in discharges to City system to
concentrations or quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater
treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the
receiving stream, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property,
or constitute a nuisance. The City may set limitations lower than the
limitations established in the regulations below if in its opinion more severe
limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. Deliberate dilution
with unpolluted water to meet the concentrations established in the regulations
below shall not be acceptable. In forming its opinion as to the acceptability,
the City will give consideration to such facts as the quantity of such waste in
relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of
the sewers, the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the
wastewater treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The limitations or
restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or water discharged to
the sanitary sewer which shall not be violated without approval of the City are
as follows:
      (1)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 104oF.
      (2)   Wastewater containing more than 100 milligrams per liter of
petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oils, products of mineral oil origin,
floatable oils, fat, wax and grease.
      (3)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded.
      (4)   All Dischargers that discharge Priority Pollutants to the City are
required to meet the Local Limit concentrations set forth in the most recent
Technical Justification as approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency.
   Any waters or wastes discharged by nonindustrial users, and non-permitted
industrial users (as per Municipal pretreatment ordinance for the City)
containing solids, liquids or gases in sufficient quantity, either singly or by
interaction with other wastes to injure or interfere with any wastewater
treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a public
nuisance, or create any hazard in the receiving waters of the Wastewater
Treatment Plant including but not limited to cyanides, hexavalent chromium,
copper, zinc, cadmium, nickel and phenols in the wastes as discharged to the
public sewer. Any discharger not issued a permit by the Director shall not
discharge any Priority Pollutant in concentrations greater than those normally
found in residential and/or commercial wastewater in the City. If a discharger
discharges any of the Priority Pollutants evaluated in current Technical
Justification approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in
concentrations exceeding background concentrations, the discharger shall submit
a wastewater discharge permit application to the Director.
   The Priority Pollutants may be changed as necessary by the City or State
regulatory agencies based on new information concerning inhibitory substances
or to protect treatment plant processes. Industrial discharges covered by
Federal pretreatment requirements shall meet those limitations required in
Chapter
933.
      (5)   Any waters or wastes containing odor-producing substances exceeding
limits which may be established by the Board or any local or State regulatory
agencies.
      (6)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits in compliance with applicable State or
Federal regulations.
      (7)   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute "slug"
as defined herein.
      (8)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant effluent
cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
      (9)   Any water or wastes which by interaction with other water or wastes
in the public sewer system, release noxious gases, form suspended solids which
interfere with the collection system, or create a condition deleterious to
structures and treatment processes.
   (l)   Substances Prohibited. No person shall discharge or cause to be
discharged any of the following described materials into any public sewers (or
treatment works):
      (1)   Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, cleaning solvents, paint
vehicles or other flammable or explosive liquid, solid or gas.
      (2)   Any waters or wastes having a pH lower than six or higher than nine
or having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to
structures, equipment and personnel of the wastewater treatment works.
      (3)   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable
of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers or other interferences with the
proper operation of the wastewater facilities such as, but not limited to,
ashes, bones, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags,
feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch manure,
hair and fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc.,
either whole or ground by garbage grinders. Direct discharges of such materials
as tar, asphalt, paint, and waxes shall also be prohibited because they may
adhere to sewers and thus reduce the effective size of the pipe.
      (4)   Any garbage which has not been properly shredded.
      (5)   Any noxious or malodorous gas or substance capable of creating a
public nuisance.
   (m)   Connections Required.  The owner of all houses, buildings or
properties used for human occupancy, employment, recreation or other purpose,
situated within the City and abutting on any street, alley, right-of-way, or
sewer easement in which there is now located or may in the future be located a
public sanitary sewer of the City is hereby required to connect such building
directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with present City law.
   (n)   When Preliminary Treatment Required. The admission into the public
sewers of any waters or wastes having characteristics which vary from normal
sewage shall be subject to the review and approval of the City. When necessary,
in the opinion of the City, such preliminary treatment facilities as may be
needed to control the quantities and rates of discharge or reduce objectionable
characteristics or constitutents shall be constructed according to plans
approved by the City. Where preliminary treatment facilities are provided for
any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and
effective operation, by the owner at his expense.
   (o)   When Private System Required.  Where a public sanitary sewer is not
available, the building sewer shall be connected to a private sewage disposal
system complying with the requirements of the State of Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency.
   No statement contained in this section shall be construed to interfere with
any additional requirements that may be imposed by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency, or Chapter
933.
   (p)   Owner's Responsibility. All costs and expenses incidental to the
installation, connection and maintenance of a building sewer lateral shall be
borne by the owner. The owner, and/or contractor shall indemnify the City from
any loss, damage or costs that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the
installation and/or maintenance and operation of any building sewer.
   (q)   Notification of Accidental Spills. When a user of the sewer system
discharges substances in violation of subsection (j) and (k) covering limited
and prohibited substances, the discharger shall immediately notify the City and
Ohio EPA of the time, location, type, quantity and concentration of the
discharge. Also, advise of what corrective actions are being taken.
Notification shall not relieve the violator of legal responsibilities regarding
the discharge.
(Ord. 5-2012. Passed 2-6-12.)
   927.03 DESIGN OF PUBLIC AND BUILDING SEWERS.
   (a)   Approval. All designs shall be approved by the City prior to
construction.
   (b)   Connection to Public Sewer. The connection of the building sewer into
the public sewer shall be made at a location determined by the City.
   (c)   Depth, Grade, Alignment and Change of Direction. All excavations
required for the installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work
unless otherwise requested by the City. Whenever possible the building sewer
shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No
building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing
wall which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford
protection from frost. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in
straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only
with proper fittings.
   (d)   EPA Standard Applies. Sewers shall be designed in accordance with the
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Design Guidelines.
   (e)   Independent Sewers Required; Exception. A separate and independent
building sewer shall be provided for every building. However, where one
building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer
is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining
alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer from the front building may
be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building
sewer. Two adjacent buildings may use a common building sewer within the limits
of the public right-of-way, however, a separate permit shall be required for
each building No other utilities will be permitted in the same trench as the
building sewer.
   (f)   Laterals. The size and slope of the building sewer lateral shall be
subject to the approval of the City, but in no event shall the diameter be less
than six inches. The slope of such six inch pipe may be not less than one-
eighth of an inch.
   (g)   Lifting Sewage by Artificial Means. In all buildings in which any
building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary
sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and
discharged to the building sewer. The initial cost of the lifting system plus
all operation, maintenance and replacement costs shall be the expense of the
property owner.
   (h)   Type of Pipe Required. The building sewer shall meet current
specifications of the City regarding type, installation and repairs.
   (i)   Construction. Construction techniques, contractor bonding, permit
requirements and inspection shall comply with current City standards and
requirements.
(Ord. 66-1987. Passed 12-7-87.)
   927.04 PERMITS AND INSPECTIONS.
   (a)   Connection Charge, Permits and Inspection Fee. Charges, permits and
inspection fees shall be in accordance with current City law.
   (b)   Tampering With or Damaging Works Prohibited. No unauthorized person
shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover,
deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part
of the wastewater treatment works. Whoever violates this provision shall be
subject to immediate arrest under charge of disorderly conduct.
   (c)   Notice to Correct or Cease Violation. Whoever violates any provision
of this chapter, except as noted above, shall be served by the City with
written notice stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable
time limit for the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within
a period of time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations.
   (d)   Powers and Authority of Inspectors. Employees of the City duly
authorized by the City and bearing proper credentials and identification shall
be permitted to enter all properties for the purposes of inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling and testing pertinent to discharge to the
wastewater treatment works in accordance with the provision of this chapter.
The authorized employees of the City are authorized to obtain information
concerning industrial or commercial processes which have a direct bearing on
the kind and source of discharge to the wastewater treatment works. A user may
withhold information considered confidential. A user must establish that the
revelation to the public of the information in question might result in an
advantage to competitors.
   While performing the necessary work on private properties, the authorized
employees of the City shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises
established by the owner, and the owner shall be held harmless for injury or
death to the City employees, and the City shall indemnify the owner against
loss or damage to its property by City employees and against liability claims
and demands for personal injury or property damaged asserted against the owner
and growing out of the gauging and sampling operation, except as such may be
caused by negligence or failure of the owner to maintain safe conditions.
(Ord. 66-1987. Passed 12-7-87.)
   927.05 SANITARY SEWER CHARGES.
   (a)   Components. Quarterly sewer charges shall consist of the following
components:
      (1)   Sewer use rates;
      (2)   Service charge; and
      (3)   Extra-strength surcharge.
   (b)   Basis of Charges. Sewer Use Rate, Service Charge and Extra Strength
Surcharge shall be as established in Section
929.03.
   The sewer use rate for wastewaters which do not exceed normal strength
wastes shall be based upon the following annual values.
   Cto =      Estimated total moneys needed for the administration, billing,
operation, maintenance, and replacement expenses of the wastewater treatment
works.
   Cf =      Estimated administration and other fixed, nonflow, BOD and
suspended solids related expenses included in Cto for the operation and
maintenance of the wastewater treatment works.
   Cs =      Estimated revenue from extra-strength surcharges.
   Qt =      The total annual volume of billable sewage flow from all users of
the Bryan Sewage System, in 100 cubic foot units.
   Su =      Total equivalent residential customers on system.
 
   Sewer Use Rate =   Cto - Cf   per 100 c.f.
                       
             Qt
   The sewage service charge shall be based on the size of water meter used and
shall approximate the portion of fixed operation and maintenance costs
attributable to each equivalent residential customer as follows:
Size Meter (Inches) Service Units
5/8 - 1             1.0
1-1/2               3.0
2                   5.0
3                   11.0
4                   16.8
6                   32.6
8                   52.4
 
   Monthly Sewage Service Charge =      Cf     (per service unit)
    Su x 12
   (c)   Extra-Strength Surcharges. In addition to the base user charges
applicable pursuant to this subsection, users discharging pollutants to the
wastewater treatment works, whose average concentration, as defined in Section
927.02(a), in one or more classifications exceeds in any quarter that
concentration defined as normal in Section
927.02(a) in the corresponding classification shall be subject to surcharges
calculated as follows:
      (1)   Surcharges for each billing period during a calendar year shall be
based upon the following values for that calendar year: the estimated total
operation and maintenance expenses (Cto); the estimated total pounds of BOD
received at the plant (Bt); and the estmated total pounds of suspended solids
received at the plant (St). Data not available shall be estimated in the most
practical manner possible.
      (2)   Surcharge on user charges per pound of BOD in excess of normal
equals:
 
   Cto x 0.13
Bt
      (3)   Surcharge on user charges per pound of suspended solids in excess
of normal equals:
 
  Cto x 0.126
St
      (4)   Pounds of BOD per billing period subject to surcharge equals:
(average concentration of BOD, calculated pursuant to Section
927.02(a) in milligrams per liter minus 260 milligrams per liter) times the
volume of wastewater discharged from the user to the wastewater treatment works
per billing period, in 100 cubic feet times .00624. If the average
concentration of BOD is 260 milligrams per liter or less, no surcharge for BOD
shall apply.
      (5)   Pounds of suspended solids per billing period subject to surcharge
equals: (average concentration of suspended solids, calculated pursuant to
Section
927.02(a), in milligrams per liter minus 260 milligrams per liter) times the
volume of wastewater discharged from the user to the wastewater treatment works
per billing period, in 100 cubic feet times .00624. If the average
concentration of suspended solids is 260 milligrams per liter or less, no
surcharge for suspended solids shall apply.
      (6)   Surcharge on user charges equals the pounds of BOD calculated
pursuant to subsection (c)(4) hereof times surcharge per pound calculated
pursuant to subsection (c)(2) hereof; plus pounds of suspended solids
calculated pursuant to subsection (c)(5) hereof; times surcharge per pound
calculated pursuant to subsection (c)(3) hereof.
      (7)   Formulas as contained in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof shall be
subject to adjustment as necessary based upon annual audit of sewer revenue
fund expenses.
      (8)   The methodology described above shall be the general basis used by
the City in determining extra-strength surcharges. The actual surcharge rates
shall be as established in Section
929.03.
   (d)   Surcharge for Other Pollutants. Surcharges may also be established for
pollutants other than those provided for which are permitted to be discharged
to the wastewater treatment works by the City after pretreatment or without
pretreatment.
   (e)   Annual Rate Review. The sanitary sewer charge rates shall assure that
each recipient of waste treatment services will pay its proportionate share of
the cost of operation and maintenance including replacement. Revenue generated
shall be proportionate to the portion of operation and maintenance necessary.
These rates shall be reviewed annually and shall be revised periodically, as
required, to reflect actual treatment works operation and maintenance costs.
   (f)   Audit, Review and Adjustment. Revenues, expenses, computations,
loadings and other data associated with sanitary sewer charges shall be audited
annually. All estimated revenues, expenses, consumptions, loadings, allocation
factors, etc. shall be reviewed and adjusted annually so as to more accurately
reflect current conditions and adjust for past inequities. One of the main
purposes of the audit shall be to maintain a proportionate distribution of the
wastewater treatment works' operation and maintenance costs, including billing,
to all users by means of the user charge system, and to insure that user
charges are sufficient to cover all operation and maintenance costs, including
billing. Within the limitations of all applicable Federal, State and local
laws, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency shall have the right to audit
industrial waste discharge records.
   (g)   Effective Date of Charges. The sanitary sewer charges established
shall commence when the building, structure or other facility is connected to a
sewer having its ultimate outlet at the wastewater treatment plant, or as of a
date 120 days following the date on which the City notifies the owner of such
premises that the sewer is available for making such connection, whichever date
first occurs and such charges shall be payable pursuant to this section.
   (h)   Notification. The City shall notify each user, at least annually of
the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributed to
wastewater treatment.
(Ord. 66-1987. Passed 12-7-87.)
   927.06 APPEALS.
   (a)   The City shall establish and maintain an administrative appeal
procedure by which individual users may be heard regarding the reasonableness
of sewer use charges levied upon them. Appeals must be submitted in writing to
the City.
   (b)   The administrative appeal procedure shall insure that:
      (1)   Each user has the opportunity for written presentation and the
right to have financial or legal counsel participate in such presentation.
      (2)   Each appeal will be decided promptly, which decision shall either
uphold the original determination or allow adjustment and/or repayment.
      (3)   Each appeal decision will include a written statement of reasons on
which the decision is based.
      (4)   Prompt repayment shall be made of any sewer use charges paid which
are determined to be due the user because of error in allocating and assessing
the charges.
      (5)   The City shall retain all documents substantiating each appeal.
         (Ord. 66-1987. Passed 12-7-87.)
   927.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   If violations of any provision of this chapter shall be found, a
written notice, stating the nature of the violation shall be sent by first
class mail to the user apparently guilty of the violation. This notice shall be
deemed sufficient, in the event of violation, if sent to the address of that
user as shown on the billing records. The notice shall, in all cases, set forth
a time limit during which all noted violations shall cease and be abated, and
appropriate corrective action taken, and if the violator shall not thus comply,
the provision of the following paragraph shall then apply.
 
   (b)   Whoever continues any violation beyond the time limit provided for in
the previous paragraph shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction
thereof shall be fined not more than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) for
each violation. Each day in which any such violation continues shall be deemed
a separate offense.
 
   (c)   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter shall become
liable to the City for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the City by
reason of such violation, notwithstanding whether such person may have been
prosecuted for a violation of the terms of this chapter.
 
   (d)   Whoever violates State and/or Federal regulations as a consequence of
violating any provisions of this chapter shall be subject to any penalties
imposed by State and/or Federal regulations, irrespective of the provisions of
this section.

   (a)   In order to provide for the cost and expense of the management,
protection and operation of the public sewage system and the Sewage Treatment
Plant, and the maintenance thereof, there is established a public sewage
service charge which shall be paid to the City for the use of the public sewage
system and the Sewage Treatment Plant by every person whose premises are served
either directly or indirectly by a connection to the public sewage system.
   (b)   Council shall make a sewage service charge to all owners of property
from which sanitary sewage or industrial waste flows into sanitary or combined
sewers that do not purchase any or all of the water used by such owner from the
water works system of the City. The rates so fixed shall be as nearly as may be
determined the same as the rates paid by those that purchase all their water
from the City.
   (c)   Council shall determine the sewage service charge for sewage or
industrial waste having an average daily flow greater than two percent (2%) of
the average daily sewage flow, or requiring special attention in the collection
and treatment of such wastes.
   (d)   Council may reduce the sewage service charge to an amount less than
fifty percent (50%) of the water rent to those that purchase water from the
City, if the water so purchased is discharged into storm sewers which do not
connect with the Sewage Treatment Plant.
(Ord. 115. Passed 5-5-52.)

Superintendent:
      (1)    The owner shall separate his plumbing so that all water
discharging into the City's sewer can be properly metered. The owner shall, at
his own expense, install and maintain such separate water meters as are
necessary to properly determine the portion of the water used which is
discharged into the City's systems.
      (2)    The owner shall install and maintain at his own expense suitable
metering equipment that shall properly ascertain the quantity of sewage being
discharged into the City's system.

leak.
(Ord. 65-1987. Passed 12-7-87.)
   929.04  A UTILITY CHARGE FOR STORM SEWERS FOR CENTER STREET OUTLET PROPERTY
OWNERS BASED ON A FORMULA.
   (a)   There shall be a utility charge for storm sewers for Center Street
property owners based on the following formula:
      (1)   The formula for the calculation is based on the following factors:
         A.   Coefficient of Runoff
            Residential Coefficient = 0.4
            City Street Coefficient = 0.9
            City R/W Coefficient = 0.2
         B.   The total cost of the project is $154,398.70.
         C.   The total area is 144.39 acres of which 134.85 acres is
residential, 4.15 acres is City Streets, and the City R/W area is 5.39 acres.
      (2)   The preliminary calculations are based on the total acres for each
category of runoff multiplied by the coefficient of runoff for that category.
         A.   Residential Runoff Acres
            134.85 x 0.4 = 53.940 acres
         B.   City Street Runoff Acres
            4.15 x 0.9 = 3.735
         C.   City R/W Runoff Acres
         D.   The total runoff acres are therefore 58.753
               5.39 x 0.2 = 1.078
      (3)   The formula is the total cost divided by the total runoff acres
equalling the cost of each runoff acre.
 
154,398.70 = $2,627.93
58.753
      (4)   The cost of the utility charge for each location is the total
runoff acres multiplied by the $2,627.93.
      (5)   To arrive at an actual cost per acre, the utility cost for the
storm sewers for each location shall be divided by the total acres for that
location.
   (b)   The utility charges for storm sewers for Alpine Drive, Sidecar First
Addition, and Sidecar Addition, have previously been paid through the original
assessments and additional taxes upon these residents of the City. Therefore,
although the utility charge for storm sewers for these three locations are
listed in Exhibit B attached to original Ordinance 32-1986, there will be no
further charges for storm sewers for property owners in this area for this
project.
(Ord. 32-86. Passed 6-2-86.)
   929.05 RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL, AND INDUSTRIAL SEWER RATES OUTSIDE THE CITY.
   (a)   Net Rate per 100 Cubic Feet. The monthly rate for sewage services

   (a) This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for discharges into the
Bryan wastewater collection and treatment system and enables the City to
protect public health in conformity with all applicable local, State and
Federal laws relating thereto.
   (b)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Bryan wastewater

way that will prevent the City's compliance with requirements of their NPDES
Discharge Permit or contaminate the resulting municipal sludge; and
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Bryan wastewater
system which do not receive adequate treatment in the POTW, and which will pass
through the system into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be
incompatible with the system.
   (c)   This chapter provides for the regulation of discharges into the Bryan
wastewater system through the enforcement of permits. This chapter does not
provide for the recovery of operations, maintenance or replacement costs of the
POTW or the costs associated with the construction of collection and treatment
systems used by dischargers, in proportion to their use of the POTW, which are
the subject of separate enactments.

comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all national
categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by
the Federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat
wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be provided, operated and
maintained at the discharger's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for review,
and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the
discharger from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to
produce an effluent acceptable to the City under the provisions of this
chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or methods of
operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the City prior to the
discharger's initiation of the changes.
(Ord. 4-2012. Passed 2-6-12.)
   933.05 LIMITATIONS ON WASTEWATER STRENGTH.
   (a) National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. National categorical
pretreatment standards as promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (U.S. EPA) pursuant to the Act shall be met by all dischargers of the
regulated industrial categories. An application for modification of the
national categorical pretreatment standards may be considered for submittal to
the Approval Authority by the Director, when the City's wastewater treatment
system achieves consistent removal of the pollutants as defined by 40 CFR
403.7.
   (b)   Dilution. No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process
water in any way, nor mix separate waste streams for the purpose of diluting a
discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve
compliance with the standards set forth in this chapter. The Director may
impose mass limitations on dischargers which are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the
imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
   (c)   Supplementary Limitations. No discharger shall discharge wastewater
containing the following enumerated materials exceeding the following
concentrations:
 
Material                                                   Concentration (ppm)

opinion of the Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, or sand. All
interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the authority,
shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired by the discharger at
their expense.
         B.   Mercury. The goal of the BMP plan is to maintain effluent
concentrations of mercury at or below a calculated local limit. However, in no
case will the permittee discharge mercury above the background concentration as
stated above.
            1.   Within 12 months of notice to require a BMP the discharger
shall develop a BMP plan and submit it to the Director for review and approval.
The objective of this plan is to identify pollution prevention and wastewater
reduction opportunities and to implement those opportunities that are
technically and economically feasible. The plan shall include the following.
               a.   A list of members of a cross-functional team responsible
for developing the BMP plan. This list shall include the name of a designated
team leader.
               b.   An inventory of sources of pollutants subject to the BMP
plan. The inventory shall include a description of each source and pollutant
loading from each source. Also, included should be the identification of the
facility's benchmark for each pollutant subject to the BMP plan.
               c.   Description of current and past BMPs and their
effectiveness.
            2.   Identification of technical/economical evaluation of new BMPs.
BMPs should include:
               a.   Substitution of materials; reformulation or redesign of
products;    modification of equipment, facilities, technology, processes, and
procedures; and improvement in management, inventory control, materials
handling or general operational phases of the facility.

every year thereafter, the discharger shall submit an annual report to the City
Administrator. The annual report shall include:
               a.   All BMP plan monitoring results for the year;
               b.   An updated inventory of sources of pollutants subject to
the BMP plan;
               c.   A summary of effectiveness of all BMPs implemented to meet
the BMP plan goal; and
               d.   Any updates to the BMP plan.
            4.   The BMP may be modified, or revoked and reissued, to revise or
remove the requirements of this paragraph based on information collected under
this paragraph.

   933.06 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES/SLUG DISCHARGE CONTROL.
   (a)   Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited or restricted materials or substances established by this chapter.
Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Director for review, and shall be approved
by the Director prior to construction of the facility. Each existing user shall
complete its plan and submit same to the Director within 180 days after this
chapter is in effect. No user who discharges to the City POTW after the
aforesaid date shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until
accidental discharge protection procedures have been approved by the Director.
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the Director
shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to modify its facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   The Director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user
needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to
control slug discharges. The Director may require any discharger to develop,
submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that
may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the Director may
develop such a plan for any discharger. An accidental discharge/slug discharge
control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the authority of any
accidental or Slug Discharge, as required by
933.23 (c) (3); and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, employee training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (c)   Users shall verbally notify the Director immediately upon the
occurrence of a "slugload" or accidental discharge of substances prohibited by
this chapter with a written notification letter to follow within three working
days. Both notifications shall include location of discharge, date and time
thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions. Any
user who discharges a slugload of prohibited materials shall be liable for any
expense, loss or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines
imposed on the Authority on account thereof under State or Federal law.
   (d)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the Director of
any significant changes to the discharger's operations or system which might
alter the nature, quality, volume or potential for slug discharges of its
wastewater at least 30 days before the change.
   (e)   Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover a
slug or accidental discharge with respect to proper emergency notification
procedures. This emergency notification procedure shall include the proper
person to notify at the POTW.
   (f)   The Director shall evaluate the need for a plan, device or structure
to control a potential slug discharge at least once during the term of each
significant industrial user's control mechanism or within one year of being
identified a significant industrial user.

submit prior notice to the Director, if possible at least ten days before the
date of the bypass.
 
   (b)   A discharger shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that
exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Director within twenty-four
hours from the time the discharger becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the discharger
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates
and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it
is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written report
on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four
hours.
(Ord. 4-2012. Passed 2-6-12.)
   933.09 PROHIBITION OF BYPASS.
   (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take enforcement action
against a discharger for a bypass, unless:
      (1)   The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
      (2)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance;
and      
      (3)   The discharger submitted notices as required under Section
933.08.
   (b)   The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its

requirements. The compliance schedule shall be as subsequently defined in
Section
933.29 . This statement will contain the Certification Statement as indicated
in Section
933.11  (b) (9) and shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
discharger. At least ninety days prior to commencement of discharge, new
sources, and sources that become dischargers subsequent to the promulgation of
an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the Director
a report containing information as indicated in Section
933.11 (b)(1) through (5), inclusive and a Certification Statement as indicated
in Section
933.11  (b) (9). New sources shall also be required to include in this report
information on the method of pretreatment the discharger intends to use to meet
applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall give estimates of the
information requested in Section
933.11 (b) (4), (5) and (9).
   A minimum of four grab samples shall be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols,
oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. For all other pollutants,
twenty-four hour composite samples shall be obtained through flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques where feasible. The Director may waive flow-
proportional composite sampling for any discharger that demonstrates that flow-
proportional sampling is not feasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained
through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of
four grab samples where the discharger demonstrates that this shall provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged.
   (b)   Compliance Date Report. Within ninety days following the date for
final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or in the case of a new
source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW,
any discharger subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit
to the Director a report containing information as indicated in Section
933.11 (b)(4) through (6), inclusive and a Certification Statement as indicated
in Section
933.11  (b) (9). The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring
the discharger into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. The compliance schedule shall be as subsequently defined in
Section
933.29 . This statement will contain the Certification Statement as indicated
in Section
933.11  (b) (9) and shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
discharger.
   For dischargers subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established by the Director in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6
(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the discharger's long
term production rate. For all other dischargers subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include
the discharger's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. This
statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger and
will contain the Certification Statement as indicated in Section
933.11  (b) (9).
   (c)   Periodic Compliance Reports. Any discharger subject to a pretreatment
standard set forth in this chapter, after the compliance date of such
pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new discharger, after commencement
of the discharge to the City, shall submit to the Director during the months of
June and December, unless required more frequently by the Director, a report
indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances
in the effluent which are limited by the pretreatment standards hereof. In
addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period. Flows shall be
reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided however, where cost or
feasibility considerations justify, the Director may accept reports of average
and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques. The City, for good cause
shown considering such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays,
budget cycles or other extenuating factors may authorize the submission of such
reports on months other than those specified above. Reports from dischargers
shall be signed by an "authorized representative" and will contain the
Certification Statement as indicated in Section
933.11  (b) (9).
   All sampling results obtained by the discharger shall be reported to the
Director including any sampling performed more frequently than required.
Dischargers shall notify the Director in writing within twenty-four hours if
any sampling results violate applicable pretreatment limits. Dischargers shall
repeat the sampling and analysis for those parameters in violation and resubmit
the results within thirty days of becoming aware of the violation.
Any discharger subject to the provisions of
933.05 (c) Supplementary Limitations. shall submit to the authority during the
months of June and December, unless required more frequently, as report
indicating compliance with the BMPs.
   (d)   Reporting Requirements for Dischargers Not Subject to Categorical
Pretreatment Standards.  The Director shall require appropriate reporting from
those dischargers with discharges that are not subject to categorical
pretreatment standards.
(Ord. 4-2012. Passed 2-6-12.)
   933.13 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   The Director may require each discharger to provide and maintain at the
discharger's own expense, a monitoring location to allow inspections, sampling
and flow measurement of each sewer discharge upon a reasonable belief that the
discharger is discharging a restricted substance into the POTW. (Ord. 4-2012.
Passed 2-6-12.)
   933.14 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (a)   The Director may inspect the monitoring facilities of any discharger
to determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The discharger
shall allow the Director or its representatives, upon presentation of
credentials of identification, to enter upon the premises of the discharger at
all reasonable hours, for the purposes of inspection, sampling, or records
examination. The Director shall have the right to set up on the discharger's
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring, or metering operations.
 
   (b)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
      (1)   Except as indicated in subsection (b)(2) and (3) below, the
discharger must collect wastewater samples using 24 hour flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the authority. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24- hour period may be composited
prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the authority,
as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance
with Instantaneous Limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of Section
933.12 (a) and (b), a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds
for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities
for which historical sampling data are available, the authority may authorize a
lower minimum. For the reports required by Section
933.12 (c), the discharger is required to collect the number of grab samples
necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements.
   (c)   If a violation is detected through sampling and analysis conducted by
the authority in lieu of the industrial discharger, the authority shall perform
the repeat sampling and analysis within thirty days of becoming aware of the
violation unless it notifies the discharger of the violation and requires the
discharger to perform the repeat sampling and analysis.
(Ord. 4-2012. Passed 2-6-12.)
   933.15 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
    Information and data furnished to the City with respect to the nature and
frequency of discharge shall be available to the public or other governmental
agency without restriction unless the discharger requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary information of the
discharger. Wastewater constituents and characteristics shall not be recognized
as confidential information. Information accepted by the City as confidential
shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by
the City until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the discharger.
(Ord. 4-2012. Passed 2-6-12.)
   933.16 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CITY.
   (a)   The City will forward pertinent information regarding changes in the
national pretreatment categorical standards to industries affected.
   (b)   Industry shall also be adequately advised of changes to the City's
Municipal Pretreatment Ordinance to permit industry compliance as outlined in
Section
933.11(c).
(Ord. 4-2012. Passed 2-6-12.)
   933.17 ALLOCATION OF POLLUTANT LOADINGS TO LOCAL INDUSTRIES.
   Prior to any of the following calculations, the maximum allowable influent
concentration to the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) and the background
loading from nonindustrial sources shall be determined.
   The following equations shall be used in determining the allowable loading
to the Wastewater Treatment Plant and the background loading.
   The Wastewater Treatment Plant loading is calculated as follows:
   WWTP loading = (WWTP flow, mgd)(8.34)(Max. allowable influent conc., mg/1)
   The background loading is calculated as follows:
   Background Loading = (Background Flow, mgd)(8.34)(Background concentration,
mg/1) The allowable loading allocated to the industries shall be calculated as
follows:
   Allowable Industry Loading = WWTP Loading - Background Loading
    From this, the allowable industry concentration shall be calculated as
follows:
      Allowable Industry Concentration =   
      Allowable Industry Loading*   
      (8.34)(Industrial Flow, mgd)
      *Minus the desired future growth allocation as determined by Council.
   The industrial flow shall include only those industries which discharge a
particular pollutant in a concentration exceeding the background concentration
for that pollutant.   
   After sufficient data is generated as a result of the pretreatment program,
the proportionate allocation method may be used to distribute the allowable
loading to each discharger. This method allocates a loading to each discharger
that is based on its current proportion of the total pollutant discharged to
the Wastewater Treatment Plant. As a result, if any reduction is required, all
dischargers shall reduce their loadings by an equal percentage. If
concentration data is available for each pollutant from each discharger, the
allocation can be allocated as follows:       
      L = LD x L1      
      Lt      
      Where L =   pounds of pollutant to be allocated to a specific discharger,
      LD =    pounds of pollutant allowed to be discharged by all dischargers,
      L1 =    pounds of pollutant discharged by discharger in question (but not
greater than the loading that is permitted based on the present local limit),
      
      Lt =    pounds of pollutant discharged by all dischargers for a specific
pollutant.
(Ord. 4-2012. Passed 2-6-12.)
   933.18 ALLOCATION OF RESTRICTED SUBSTANCE LIMITATIONS.
   Any decision concerning the necessity or means of allocating the limits on
restricted substances that a discharger may discharge into the POTW shall be
made by Council upon the petition by a discharger or the advice of the Director
and after a hearing held upon notice to all dischargers affected by the
allocation.
(Ord. 4-2012. Passed 2-6-12.)
   933.19 NOTIFICATION OF CHANGED DISCHARGE.
   All dischargers shall promptly notify the Director in advance of any
substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge,
including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the
discharger has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p). (Ord. 4-
2012. Passed 2-6-12.)
   933.20 TESTING PROCEDURES.
   All sampling and analysis required for baseline monitoring reports, ninety
day compliance reports and periodic compliance reports shall be performed in
accordance with 40 CFR 136 methodology.
(Ord. 4-2012. Passed 2-6-12.)
   933.21 EMERGENCY SUSPENSION OF SERVICE AND DISCHARGE PERMITS.
   The City may for good cause shown suspend wastewater treatment service and/
or a wastewater discharger permit to a discharger when it appears to the City
that an actual or threatened discharge presents an imminent or substantial
danger to the health or welfare of persons, substantial danger to the
environment, interference with the operation of the POTW or violation of any
pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter. Any discharger notified of the
suspension of the City's wastewater treatment service shall, within a
reasonable period of time as determined by the City, cease all discharges. In
the event of failure of the discharger to comply voluntarily with the
suspension order within the specified time, the City shall commence judicial
proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the discharger's compliance with
such order. The City shall reinstate wastewater treatment service and/or a
wastewater discharge permit and terminate any judicial proceedings upon proof
by the discharger of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or
conditions creating the threat of imminent or substantial danger as set forth
above.
(Ord. 4-2012. Passed 2-6-12.)
   933.22 REVOCATION OF PERMIT.
   The City may terminate a wastewater discharge permit for any discharger who
fails to:
   (a) Factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its
discharge;
   (b)   Report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics;
   (c)   Permit reasonable access to the discharger's premises by authorized
agent(s) of the City for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
   (d)   Who violates the conditions of this chapter, or any final judicial
order entered with respect thereto.

      (2)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of all of the measurements for each
pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product
of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable
TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH);   
      (3)   Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum
or longer term average) that the Director determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);
      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
of human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)   Failure to meet, within ninety days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or

herein established and intended to define the steps by which an applicant may
design, make application, record plats and construct public improvements in the
development of land.
(Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1131.02 PLAT APPROVAL REQUIRED.
   No owner, agent or person having control of any land within the City shall
subdivide, or lay out such land in lots in a subdivision unless by a plat in
accordance with the Subdivision Regulations contained herein. Lots subdivided

approved according to the procedures set forth in Section
1131.08.
   (a)   Approval Required Prior To Recording Plat. No plat shall be recorded
or have any validity unless and until approved as herein required. If an
unapproved plat is recorded, it shall be considered invalid and Council may
institute proceedings to have the plat stricken from the records of the County.
   (b)   Plat Approval Required Prior to Selling Lots. No owner or agent of the
owner of any land located in a subdivision shall transfer, sell, agree to sell,
or negotiate to sell any land by reference to, exhibition of, or use of a plat
of a subdivision before such plat is approved and recorded according to the
procedures set forth in these Subdivision Regulations. The description of such
lot or parcel by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer, or in other
documents used in the process of selling or transferring, shall not exempt the
transaction from these Subdivision Regulations.
   (c)   Plat Approval Required for Zoning Permit. A zoning permit shall not be
issued for any structure on a lot in a subdivision until:
      (1)   A plat has been approved and recorded according to the procedures
set forth in these Subdivision Regulations;
      (2)   The City Engineer states, in writing, that the improvements
required by these Subdivision Regulations have been completed and accepted by
the City by ordinance, or the completion of such improvements has been
guaranteed according to the provisions set forth in these Subdivision
Regulations; and
      (3)   The required fees established by Council are paid by the developer
or subdivider. (Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1131.03 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   The design and layout of all subdivisions shall conform with the
design standards for subdivisions set forth in Chapter
1133, and all zoning regulations governing the area and dimensions of lots set
forth in Title Five of this Planning and Zoning Code. The subdivider shall make
public improvements and shall submit preliminary and final plats, all in
accordance with these Subdivision Regulations.
   (b)    If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed to be subdivided
is unsuitable due to flooding, bad drainage, steep slopes, rock formations and
other such conditions as may increase the danger to health, life or property or
aggravate erosion or flood hazards, and if, from adequate investigations
conducted by all the public agencies concerned, it is determined that, in the
best interest of the public, the land should not be platted and developed for
the purpose proposed, the Commission shall not approve such subdivision unless
adequate methods are formulated by the subdivider for meeting the problems
created by such subdivision of land.
   (c)   The Commission may refuse to approve what it considers to be a
scattered or premature development or subdivision of land which may involve
danger or injury to the public health, safety, welfare or prosperity by reason
of lack of adequate water supply, schools, proper drainage, good roads and
transportation facilities or other public services, or which would necessitate
an excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services, such
as undue maintenance costs for adequate roads.
(Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1131.04 CONSULTATION PRIOR TO SUBMISSION.
   Before the subdivision plat is prepared, the subdivider is encouraged to
consult with the City Engineer and Zoning Administrator to become thoroughly
familiar with all the subdivision requirements and with all applicable zoning
regulations and the Comprehensive Plan of the city affecting the territory in
which the proposed subdivision lies. The subdivider may also consult with:
   (a)   The City Engineer regarding roads and drainage or other construction
requirements.
   (b)   The City Engineer and the Director of Utilities regarding availability
of sanitary sewer lines, water lines and electric service.
      (Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1131.05 SKETCH PLAN.
   (a)   For subdivisions where public utilities are not readily accessible to
the site or where rezoning is also involved in the project, the applicant
shall, as an exploratory step, submit a sketch plan to the Zoning
Administrator. All other applicants are encouraged, but not required, to submit
a sketch plan.
   (b)   Purpose. The purpose of sketch plan review is to:
      (1)   Discuss early and informally with the applicant the locations of
proposed major streets, parks, playgrounds, school sites and other planned
projects that may affect the property being considered for subdivision.
      (2)   Review with the City Engineer, Zoning Administrator the minimum
standards of subdivision design and improvements set forth in Chapter 1133.

informal opinion as to the proposed subdivision's compliance with the
requirements of this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (d)   Review Process. No action shall be taken at such a meeting and no
opinions, suggestions, or recommendations discussed shall be construed by the
applicant to constitute automatic approval of a subsequently submitted
preliminary plat application.
(Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1131.06 PRELIMINARY PLAT
   (a)   Purpose. The preliminary plat of a subdivision is not intended to
serve as a record plat. Its purpose is to show on a map all facts needed to
enable the Planning Commission to determine whether the proposed layout of the
land in question is satisfactory from the standpoint of the public interest. It
enables the applicant and the Planning Commission to explore the best
relationship to adjoining subdivisions or adjoining land and outline a program
of improvements. The preliminary plat shall be planned by a qualified
technician trained in the layout of subdivisions.
   (b)   Significance of Approved Preliminary Plat. An approved preliminary
plat shall not constitute acceptance of the final plat but shall be the basis
of approval of the final plat regarding the general layout of streets, lots,
and open space. Approval of the preliminary plat authorizes the applicant to:
      (1)   Prepare and submit an application for Final Plat.
      (2)   Prepare and submit construction drawings of the proposed roads,
sewer and water systems and other proposed public facilities to the City
Engineer whose approval shall be required prior to the approval of the final
plat by the Planning Commission;
      (3)   Complete final surveys for the design of roads, utilities and lots;
   (c)   Submission Requirements. The preliminary plat shall be prepared in
accordance with the regulations set forth herein, and shall be approved prior
to the completion of final surveys of roads and lots and before the start of
any grading or construction work. Where the preliminary plat covers only part
of the subdivider's entire holding, a sketch plan of the entire holding shall
be submitted in order to consider the proposed subdivision's connections with
the road system of the part not submitted.
      (1)   Application. An application for approval of a preliminary plat
shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator, on forms provided by the Zoning
Administrator, together with the required number of copies of the plat and the
supplemental submission material required by this section.
      (2)   Form. The preliminary plat shall be drawn at a scale of not less
1"=100'and shall be on one or more sheets, with dimensions which are multiples
of six (6) inches in either direction.
      (3)   Identification. Each plat, map and accompanying data shall contain
the proposed name of the subdivision. The name shall not approximate,
phonetically or otherwise, the name of any other subdivision in the City. Each
map shall include a north point, scale and date. All documentation shall
contain the names and addresses of owner, developer, and the engineer or other
technician who prepared the documentation, and the preparation date and any
dates of revision thereto.
      (4)   Contents. The information required for the preliminary plat and
accompanying information shall include:
         A.   Vicinity Map. A vicinity map at a scale of not less than 1"=1000'

   1150.02 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   Those districts established in Section
1150.01 are bounded and defined as shown on the map entitled "Official Zoning
Map" of the City of Bryan.
   (a)   The map and all notations, references and other pertinent material
shown thereon is hereby incorporated by reference and declared to be a part of
this Planning and Zoning Code, thereby having the same force and effect as if
such Map and accompanying notations, references and other information were all
fully set forth or described herein.
   (b)   The Zoning Map shall be kept on file and available for examination at
the office of the Zoning Administrator.
      (Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1150.03 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the
aforesaid districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall
apply:
   (a)   Where Boundaries Approximately Follow Streets, Alleys or Highways.
Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center
line or street line of streets, the center line or alley line of alleys, or the
center line or right-of-way lines of highways, such lines shall be construed to
be such district boundaries.
   (b)   Where Boundaries Parallel Street Lines, Alley Lines or Highway Right-
of-Way Lines.  Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are
approximately parallel to the center line or street line of streets, the center
line or alley line of alleys, or the center line or right-of-way lines of
highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto
and at such distance therefrom as indicated on the Map. If no distance is
given, such dimensions shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the
Zoning Map.
   (c)   Where Boundaries Approximately Follow Lot Lines. Where district
boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot lines, such lot lines
shall be construed to be such boundaries.
   (d)   Vacation of Public Ways. Whenever any street, alley or other public
way is vacated in a manner authorized by law, the zoning district adjoining
each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended
to the center of such vacation and all areas included in the vacation shall
then and henceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended district.
   (e)   Resolving Disputes.  Whenever the Zoning Administrator cannot
definitely determine the location of a district boundary by such center lines,
street lines, by the scale or dimensions stated on the Zoning Map or by the
fact that it clearly coincides with a lot line, the Zoning Administrator shall
refuse action, and the Planning Commission, upon appeal, shall interpret the
location of the district boundary with reference to the scale of the Zoning Map
and the purposes set forth in all relevant provisions of this Zoning Code.
      (Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1150.04 CLASSIFICATION OF ANNEXED LAND.
   Upon annexation of township territory to the City of Bryan, the township
zoning regulations then in effect shall remain in full force and shall be
enforced by the township officials until the Council adopts zoning regulations
for the property. As an alternative to the procedures set forth in Chapter
1114, Council may, after a report and recommendation by the Planning
Commission, by ordinance made at or prior to the time of its acceptance of
township territory for annexation, classify all or any part of territory
annexed to the City in such other district or districts as Council may
determine. Such ordinance shall follow the procedures for zoning amendment
established in Chapter
1114. Such ordinance shall not be passed as an emergency measure.

established in order to achieve, among others, the following purposes:
   (a)   To provide in appropriate and convenient locations, sufficient areas
for business activities, including the exchange of goods and services;
   (b)   To protect residential neighborhoods adjacent to business uses by
regulating the types of establishments, particularly at the common boundaries,
that would create congestion, noise or other objectionable influences;
   (c)   To protect and stabilize both residential and nonresidential
developments from congestion by requiring off-street parking facilities;
   (d)   C-1 Neighborhood Commercial District. To provide Neighborhood
Commercial Districts to accommodate a variety of retail and service
establishments in a store-only district with development standards that ensure
that new development is compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods.

and activities in locations adequately served by major streets and other
facilities and to encourage the grouping of businesses in shopping centers.
   (f)   C-3 Central Business District. To provide a central business district
that preserves, maintains and promotes the existing historic, compact
pedestrian orientation of the downtown area by maintaining retail sales and
personal service uses along the primary street frontages, permitting buildings
to be close to the street and to one another, and reducing the parking
requirements for the district.
      (1)   To further achieve these objectives, the District has been divided
into the "core area" and "outside core area". The core area is defined by the
boundaries of the Downtown Bryan Historic District, as listed on the National
Register, where development standards have been established to maintain the
traditional character and arrangement of lots around the square. Slightly more
generous development standards have been established for the areas adjacent to
the downtown that make up the outside core area, where existing lot
arrangements are more flexible. Design criteria have also been established for
both areas to ensure consistent development throughout the entire C-3 District.

   1160.08 MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   Structures shall not be permitted to become deteriorated, decayed, remain
fire damaged or otherwise un-maintained in any manner, as further specified
below:
   (a)   Foundations, Exterior Walls, Roofs and Appurtenances.  
      (1)   Foundations. The foundation of every structure within the City
shall be maintained free from damaged, loose, or missing, block bricks, tile,
or any other deteriorated foundation material, nor shall any foundation
otherwise be maintained in a condition so as to potentially damage the
integrity of the structure that it supports.
      (2)   Exterior walls, structures and appurtenances. Every exterior wall,
door, porch, patio, floor, step, chimney, railing, window, sill, sash, molding,
lintel, frame, gutter, downspout, lattice, fence, gate, or any other exterior
portion of a structure or any parts or features thereof, shall be maintained
free from holes, cracks, damaged, decayed, deteriorated, warped, loose, or
missing materials, and shall otherwise be maintained in good repair and in a
structurally safe, sound and functioning condition. All windows, doors, roofs,
walls, or other means of access to a building or structure shall be secured
against uncontrolled outside access.
      (3)   Roofs. Every roof shall be maintained in good repair and in a
weather-tight condition and shall otherwise be structurally sound and free from
holes, cracks, damaged, decayed, deteriorated, warped, loose, or missing
materials. All missing shingles or other roofing materials shall be replaced
with materials of a similar kind, nature, design and color as the remaining

Administrator to have more than five percent (5%) of its total area comprised
of missing or deteriorated shingles or other roofing materials shall be
replaced.
   (b)   Surface Coating Protection of Structures and Appurtenances Required.
All exterior surfaces of every structure and appurtenances thereto in the City
shall be maintained so as to resist decay or deterioration from the elements or
from any other naturally occurring cause. To this end, all exterior surfaces
shall be free from holes, breaks, and loose or rotting materials so as to
effectively prevent such decay or deterioration. Any exterior wall segment,
facing, or other distinguishable surface area determined by the Zoning
Administrator to have more than five percent (5%) of its total area bare or
otherwise deteriorated shall be required to be appropriately repaired and
surface coated as specified above. If the surface to be coated is only a
portion of a structure, then such surface coating shall be compatible in color,
texture, and design with the entire structure.
   (c)   Repair or Removal of Deteriorated or Decayed Buildings or Structures.
When the Zoning Administrator has determined that a violation of this code has

structures that have been found in violation of the code.
      (1)   Notification required. The City shall give notice by certified mail
of its intentions with respect to repair or removal of the structure, to the
owner of such property. If the owner's address is unknown and cannot be
reasonably obtained, it is sufficient to publish the notice once in a newspaper
of general circulation in the City.
      (2)   Failure to repair or remove.  Within thirty (30) days of notice by
the City, plans shall be submitted by the owner to the Zoning Administrator
regarding the intended course of action for repair or removal of the structure.
Within ninety (90) days from notice by the City, repair or removal as approved
by the Zoning Administrator shall be completed, unless an extension is granted
by the Zoning Administrator. If within the time period stated above the owner
of such structure has not repaired or removed such structure, the owner may be
cited and the City may provide for the repair or removal of the structure,
either through an available public agency, by contract, or by arrangement with
private persons, and the cost of which shall be charged against the real estate
upon which the structure is located and shall be a lien upon such real estate.

1 Front Yards on Built-up Blocks. In any district where more than 40%
of the lots in a block are occupied by existing structures, the minimum
depth of a front yard shall not be less than the average depth of the
front yards of the existing structures on the adjoining lots on either
side; or where there is an existing structure on adjoining lots on only
one side, the minimum setback shall be the same as the existing
structure.

within 100 feet.
b)   When the lot is within 100 feet of an existing building on both
sides, the depth of the front yard shall not be greater than the
average depth of the adjacent front yards.
c)   When the lot is within 100 feet of an existing building on only
one side, the maximum depth of the front yard for the lot in question
shall be determined by adding five feet plus the depth of the adjacent
front yard of the existing building, and dividing by two.
5 However, when two adjacent buildings do not share a common wall, they
shall maintain a minimum separation of 20 feet.
6 When a property abuts a state route, the greater setback shall apply.

CHAPTER 1163
Conditional Use Regulations
1163.01   Purpose.
1163.02   General criteria for all conditional uses.
1163.03   Development standards for conditional uses.
   1163.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   Conditional uses need to be adequately monitored in order to ensure
that the use and its operational aspects are indeed appropriate in the specific
location in which the use is proposed. Such monitoring is necessary because the
external impacts of a particular use are either sufficiently varied or
indeterminable in advance, making it possible that, without the Planning
Commission's review, a particular use could be inappropriate in certain
locations within the district.
   (b)   Ensure that conditional uses are reviewed in a reasonable and
equitable manner, while safeguarding the property rights of all individuals and
the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. Provide for more
detailed evaluation of each use listed as a conditional use in a specific
district with respect to such considerations as location, design, size, method
(s) of operation, intensity of use, requirements for public facilities and
traffic generation.
(Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1163.02 GENERAL CRITERIA FOR ALL CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   Conditional uses shall be subject to additional criteria identified in
Section
1170.
   (b)   A conditional use, and uses accessory to such conditional use, shall
be permitted in a district only when specified as a conditional use in such
district, and only if such use conforms to the following general criteria,
which are in addition to specific conditions, standards and regulations set
forth in Section
1163.03 and Chapter
1161.
   (c)   The Planning Commission shall review the particular facts and
circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the following criteria and shall
find adequate evidence that:
      (1)   The conditional use will be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate with the prevailing existing
or intended character of the general vicinity.
      (2)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the conditional use
will not endanger the public health, safety or general welfare.
      (3)   The conditional use will not be more hazardous or more disturbing
to the existing and future use and enjoyment of properties in the immediate
vicinity than uses that are permitted by right, nor substantially diminish or
impair property values within the neighborhood.
      (4)   The establishment of the conditional use in the proposed location
will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the
surrounding property for uses permitted in the district.
      (5)   There is minimal potential for future hardship on the conditional
use that could result from the proposed use being surrounded by uses permitted
by right that may be incompatible.
   (d)   Nothing in these regulations shall prohibit the Planning Commission
from prescribing reasonable supplementary conditions and safeguards in addition
to these requirements in order to ensure compliance with the criteria set forth
in this Section. Conditions may include limitations on noise beyond the
property lines, hours of operation, paving to limit the creation of dust,
additional fences, walls or shrubs, etc.
(Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1163.03 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   Conformance with District Regulations. A conditional use shall conform
to the regulations of the district in which it is located and to other
substantive requirements of this Planning and Zoning Code, as well as satisfy
the conditions, standards and requirements of this Chapter. Whenever there is a
difference between the provisions of the conditional use regulations and the
district regulations, the provisions of this Chapter shall prevail, unless
clearly indicated differently in the regulations.
   (b)   The following regulations shall modify the minimum lot, yard, and
parking location requirements for the listed conditional use permit:
                                                                    Min.     Min.

of the residents of the City;
      (4)   To minimize any adverse effects on residential properties, parks,
open spaces and the non-intensive commercial zoning districts; and
      (5)   To promote collocation of wireless telecommunication facilities in
order to decrease the number of towers in the City.
   (b)   Permitted Locations.
      (1)   A wireless telecommunications tower or facility is permitted in the
following areas when in compliance with these regulations and approved by the
Planning Commission according to the procedures set forth in Chapter
1181, Development Plan Review. Efforts shall be made to locate in the areas

preferred location is proposed, the applicant shall demonstrate to the Planning
Commission that a technically suitable, higher priority location is not
available and that the proposed location is needed to meet the reasonable
service requirements of the applicant.
      (2)   New wireless antennas may collocate on existing telecommunication
towers or on existing structures, which have been constructed for other
purposes, such as but not limited to water towers, church towers, electric
transmission towers, chimneys, and cooling towers.

electric high-tension power line easement, provided that the tower shall not
exceed the height of the existing high-tension power line towers by more than
ten (10) feet and the wireless telecommunication tower shall not be located
within forty (40) feet of such existing high tension power line towers.
   (c)   Locations Requiring Conditional Use Approval.
      (1)   A wireless telecommunications tower or facility may be considered
in the following areas as a conditional use when approved by the Planning
Commission according to the procedures set forth in Chapter
1182, Conditional Use Certificates. When considering an application, the
Planning Commission shall determine that the applicant demonstrates compliance
with the standards set forth in subsection (d) below as well as the standards
set forth in Chapter
1163, Conditional Use Regulations, and the applicant has demonstrated that more
preferred locations are not technically suitable. Efforts shall be made to
locate the towers in the order of priority listed.
         A.   In a C-2, M-U, I-1 or I-2 zoning district, when located less than
twice the height of the tower from a residential district.
         B.   In a C-1 and C-3 zoning district, when located at least twice the
height of the tower from a residential dwelling.

twice the height of the tower from an existing residential dwelling.
   (d)   Standards Applicable for Conditional Use Applications.
      (1)   A wireless telecommunication facility that is proposed in a
location that requires conditional use approval shall comply with the
following:
         A.   A wireless telecommunication facility shall be permitted in a
location set forth in subsection (c) above only to the extent that a
technically suitable location is not available in an area identified in
subsection (b) above. The applicant shall demonstrate that a technically
suitable location in an area identified in subsection (b) above is not
available because:
            1.   A technically suitable location does not exist in any area set
forth in subsection (b) above. The applicant shall provide documentation that
supports the applicant's claim that no such technically suitable location
exists; or
            2.   If another tower, building or structure set forth in
subsection (b) above is technically suitable then the applicant must show that
reasonable efforts have been made to:
               a.   Request co-location on the existing tower(s), building(s)
or structure(s) and that each co-location request was rejected by the owner of
the tower, building or structure; or
               b.   Request all owners of properties that are determined to be
technically suitable locations to allow it to construct a wireless
telecommunication tower under reasonable terms and that each request was
rejected.
         B.   As a condition of approving the conditional use permit to
construct and operate a wireless telecommunication tower in the City, the
owner/operator of the wireless telecommunication tower shall be required to
allow co-location until said tower has reached full antenna capacity. In no
event shall the owner/operator agree to allow fewer than two (2) additional
antenna platforms. Agreement to this provision shall be included in the
applicant's lease with the landowner, if different from the owner/operator of
such tower. Written documentation shall be presented to the Planning Commission

   1172.05 ALLOWANCE FOR SHARED PARKING.
   The Planning Commission may approve a development plan with a reduction in
the number of parking spaces required if it can be shown that the lesser number
of spaces is appropriate and consistent with these regulations when it is
determined that:
   (a)   In a mixed-use project or a single-use project for which the different
components of the use have varying peak demands, the uses can be adequately
accommodated with a lesser number of parking spaces than that which is required
based on the sum of the various uses computed separately.
   (b)   The required parking spaces for a proposed use can be accommodated on
an adjacent or nearby site and binding arrangements are made between the
businesses and other property owners that are not normally open, used or
operated during the same hours to share parking facilities in order to meet
their parking requirements. In such case not more than fifty percent (50%) of
the required parking spaces shall be shared. (Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1172.06 REDUCED STANDARDS FOR C-3, CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT.
   In recognition of the historic, compact character of buildings in the
Central Business District, as well as the less efficient use of the floor area
of those buildings, the number of off-street parking spaces for each facility
or use in the Central Business District shall be determined according to the
following:
   (a)   The number of off-street parking spaces shall be seventy-five percent
(75%) of the standards set forth in Section
1172.04.
   (b)   However, due to unique building and site characteristics that may be
present in the Central Business District, the Planning Commission may approve a
development plan with fewer parking spaces than seventy-five percent (75%) of
the requirements set forth in Section
1172.04. In order for the Planning Commission to consider a reduction of the
required spaces, the applicant must demonstrate that such a reduction is
warranted based on the following criteria:
      (1)   The character of the proposed use, the design of the building and
the ability of the proposed use to reinforce the main street environment;
      (2)   The availability and accessibility of public parking spaces, both
on-street and within public parking lots;
      (3)   The availability of parking areas on adjacent sites, considering
the hours of operation of the proposed use compared to adjacent uses; and
      (4)   The potential negative impact to the character of the district if
the requisite number of parking spaces is provided.
         (Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1172.07 DEFERRED CONSTRUCTION OF REQUIRED SPACES.
   If the number of parking spaces required in Section 1172.04 is substantially
larger than the number anticipated by the applicant and the applicant provides
sufficient evidence that supports the reduced parking needs, a development plan
may be approved with an allowance for the construction of a lesser number of
parking spaces provided that:
   (a)   The total number of spaces initially constructed shall not be less
than seventy percent (70%) of the spaces required by Section
1172.04.
   (b)   Suitable area(s) are reserved for the construction of the balance of
the total number of spaces otherwise required by Section
1172.04. Such suitable areas shall be illustrated on the development plan in
locations and with landscaping in full compliance with this Zoning Code.
   (c)   The Planning Commission, upon reevaluation of the project's parking
needs, may at any time direct that some or all of the parking spaces identified
in subsection (b) be constructed.
   (d)   When additional parking is determined necessary, it shall be provided
according to the approved development plan.
      (Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1172.08 LOCATION OF REQUIRED PARKING SPACES.
   In addition to specific requirements contained in each district regulation,
the location of off-street parking facilities shall further be regulated
according to the following provisions:
   (a)   Off-street parking spaces required for dwelling units shall be located
on the same lot as the dwelling unit served. Required guest parking in a multi-
family development shall be equally distributed throughout the development.
   (b)   Off-street parking spaces required for nonresidential uses shall be
located within 700 feet of the use measured along lines of public access to the
property. When spaces are to be provided on an adjacent or nearby site, a
written agreement shall be made between the applicant and the property owner(s)
of such adjacent or nearby site prior to approval.
   (c)   All required off-street parking spaces shall have direct access to an
aisle or driveway without the need to move any other vehicle.
      (Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1172.09 OFF-STREET WAITING SPACES FOR DRIVE-THRU FACILITIES.
   Drive-thru establishments and other establishments which, by their nature,
create lines of customers waiting to be served within automobiles shall provide
off-street waiting areas, on the same lot as the use, in addition to the
required number of parking spaces specified in Section
1172.04, in accordance with the following:
   (a)   Minimum Number of Waiting Spaces.
 
(1) Establishments serving and/or       10 waiting spaces

   1173.03 COMPUTATIONS.
   (a)   Determining Sign Area or Dimension. The area of a sign shall be
determined using the following calculation methods.
      (1)   For a sign that is framed, outlined, painted or otherwise prepared
and designed to include a background for a sign display, the sign area or
dimensions shall include the entire portion within such background or frame but
shall not include the pole or other structural support unless such structural
support is illuminated or otherwise so designated to constitute a display
device.
      (2)   For a sign comprised of individual letters, figures, emblems, logos
or elements on a wall, or an irregular shaped freestanding sign, the area of
the sign shall encompass the smallest regular, or a combination of regular
geometric shapes that form or approximate the perimeter of all the elements in
the display. When separate elements are organized to form a single sign, but
the elements are separated by open space, the area shall be calculated by
determining one or more geometric forms that comprise the entire display area,
including the space between the elements.
      (3)   The area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by
adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two
(2) identical sign faces are placed back to back so that both faces cannot be
viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of
the same sign structure and are not more than forty-two (42) inches apart, the
sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
   (b)   Determining Sign Height.  The height of a freestanding sign shall be
computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top
of the highest attached component of the sign.
      (1)   Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of:
         A.   Existing grade prior to construction, or
         B.   The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any
filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating
the sign.
      (2)   In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined,
sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the
normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest
point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal
entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is higher.
   (c)   Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit. The building wall

reoccupied by a similar use and the new occupant requires no external building
or site renovation, then the message of a nonconforming sign may be changed.
         B.   An existing sign pursuant to this subsection may be changed by
replacing a sign panel or by repainting a sign face only. Such alterations
shall not require changes to the structure, framing or erection or relocation
of the sign unless such changes conform to this Chapter.
      (3)   Subject to the provisions of this section, nonconforming signs may
be repaired and renovated so long as the cost of such work does not exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the value of such sign within any twelve (12)-month
period.

Chapter, including payment of the required fee.

   1182.12 SIMILAR USES.
   Within each zoning district established by the Planning and Zoning Code and
amendments thereto, uses of land or structures, which are compatible with each
other, are permitted in the district. To the extent that new types of uses are
created and are not addressed by this Planning and Zoning Code, this section
provides the procedure by which the Planning Commission may determine a new use
is similar to a use permitted in a district.
   (a)   Determination. A proposed use may be permitted as a similar use when
the Planning Commission determines that such proposed use complies the

application for a similar use determination and provide the reasons for their
decision.
   (d)   Assignment to Districts. If Council, by a majority vote of its
members, concurs with the recommendations of the Planning Commission and
approves the proposed similar use, then the similar use shall be added to those
districts that allow the principal or conditional use that is most similar, as
identified in the recommendation. (Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)

      (6)   Site plans, floor plans, elevations and other drawings at a
reasonable scale to convey the need for the variance;
      (7)   Payment of the application fee as established by Council;
      (8)   Any other documents deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator;
      (9)   The application and required documentation shall be submitted at
least eighteen (18) days prior to the meeting of the Planning Commission at
which the application is to be considered. Applications received less than
eighteen (18) days in advance of a meeting will be placed on the agenda of the
next Planning Commission meeting.
   (b)   Review for Completeness. Within ten (10) days after receiving an
application for variance, the Zoning Administrator shall review the submitted
application for completeness and compliance with the applicable submission
requirements. If the application is deemed insufficient, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the applicant of the necessary changes or additional
information needed. When the application is deemed complete and the application
fee has been paid, the Zoning Administrator shall officially accept the
application for consideration of the action(s) requested on the date such
determination is made and place it on the Planning Commission's agenda.
   (c)   Review by the Planning Commission. The Commission shall hold a public
hearing and give notice of the same. Notice of the public hearing shall be
given by first class mail to the applicant and to the property owners within
250 feet of the subject property. The Planning Commission shall review each
application for a variance to determine if it complies with the purpose and
intent of this Planning and Zoning Code and evidence demonstrates that the
literal enforcement of this Planning and Zoning Code will result in practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Area Variance. The following factors shall be considered and
weighed by the Planning Commission to determine practical difficulty:
         A.   Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same zoning district. Examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot;
         B.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         C.   Whether the variance is substantial and is the minimum necessary
to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
         D.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
         E.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services such as water, sewer, trash pickup;
         F.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restrictions;
         G.   Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result of
actions of the owner;
         H.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
         I.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting a variance; and
         J.   Whether the granting of the variance requested will confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this regulation to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
      (2)   Use Variance. In order to grant a use variance, the Planning
Commission shall determine that strict compliance with the terms of this
Planning and Zoning Code will result in unnecessary hardship to the applicant.
The following factors shall be considered and weighed by the Planning
Commission to determine practical difficulty:
         A.   The property cannot be put to any economically viable use under
any of the permitted uses in the zoning district in which the property is
located;
         B.   The variance requested stems from a condition which is unique to
the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district;
         C.   The hardship condition is not created by actions of the
applicant;
         D.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the rights
of adjacent property owners or residents;
         E.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public
health, safety or general welfare;
         F.   The variance will be consistent with the general spirit and
intent of the Planning and Zoning Code; and
         G.   The variance sought is the minimum that will afford relief to the
applicant.
   (d)   Requests for Additional Information. The Planning Commission may
request that the applicant supply additional information that the Commission
deems necessary to review and evaluate the request for a variance.
   (e)   Additional Conditions and Safeguards. The Planning Commission may
further prescribe any conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary to
ensure that the objectives of the regulation(s) or provision(s) to which the
variance applies will be met.
   (f)   Action by the Planning Commission. The Commission shall either
approve, approve with supplementary conditions as specified in subsection (e)
above, or disapprove the request for variance according to the procedures
established for appeals in Section
1183.07.
   (g)   Term and Extension of Variance. Variances shall be non-assignable and
shall expire one year from the date of their enactment, unless prior thereto,
the applicant commences actual construction in accordance with the granted
variance or an extension of time has been granted by the Zoning Administrator.
There shall be no modification of variances except by further consideration of
the Commission. Once the time limit pursuant to this Section has expired, a
request for a variance shall be considered to be a new application for a
variance and shall meet all requirements for application and review pursuant to
this Section.
      (Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1183.09 APPEALS TO THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS.
   Decisions by the Planning Commission granting or denying a variance shall be
final. Appeals shall be subject to judicial review by the Court of Common Pleas
of Williams County, Ohio, in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio.

CHAPTER 1184
Nonconformities
1184.01   Purpose.
1184.02   Nonconforming uses, lots, buildings, and structures.
   1184.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to recognize the existence of uses,
buildings, lots and structures that lawfully existed at the time of this
Planning and Zoning Code's enactment, or amendment thereto, but which now do
not conform with one or more of the regulations contained in this Planning and
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 62-2023. Passed 1-16-24.)
   1184.02 NONCONFORMING USES, LOTS, BUILDINGS, AND STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Nonconforming status is considered to be incompatible with permitted
uses in the zoning district in which it exists. Therefore, nonconforming uses,
buildings, lots, and structures are subject to regulations limiting their use,
restoration, reconstruction, extension, and substitution. Such nonconforming
status shall be continued only in conformance with this Chapter.
      (1)   Permitted Use on Nonconforming Lot. A lot of record existing on the
effective date of this Planning and Zoning Code may be occupied by a use listed
as a permitted principal use in Chapter
1162 for the district in which the lot is located even when the lot does not
comply with the minimum requirements set forth in Chapter
1161, provided the use can be conducted in compliance with all other
requirements set forth in this Planning and Zoning Code.
      (2)   Nonconforming Lots. A lot of record that does not comply on the
effective date of this Planning and Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto, with
the lot area and/or lot width regulations of the district in which the lot is
located may be used as follows:
         A.   Existing Dwelling on a Residential Lot. If the lot is occupied by
a dwelling, such dwelling shall be maintained and may be repaired, modernized
or altered, provided that the building shall not be enlarged in floor area
unless the enlarged section(s) complies with all regulations of this Planning
and Zoning Code, except for the lot area and lot width regulations of the
district in which the lot is located. The number of dwelling units shall not be
increased unless all regulations, including lot area, are complied with.
         B.   Single Nonconforming Lot of Record in a Residential District. A
nonconforming lot in a Residential District that is in separate ownership and
not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership shall be
permitted to be developed as a site for a single-family dwelling provided that
the dwelling and its accessory uses comply with all regulations of this
Planning and Zoning Code, except for the lot area and lot width regulations of
the district in which the lot is located.
         C.   Lots in Combination. If a vacant nonconforming lot adjoins one or
more lots in common ownership on the effective date of this Planning and Zoning
Code, or applicable amendment thereto, such lots shall be replatted to create
conforming lots as a prerequisite for development.
         D.   Lots Under Separate Ownership. A nonconforming lot of record that
is owned separately from adjoining lots on the effective date of this Code, or
as amended, which affected its conformity shall not be reduced in any manner
that would increase its nonconforming situation.
      (3)   Nonconforming Use of Buildings and Land. A nonconforming use may
continue so long as it remains otherwise lawful and does not constitute a
public nuisance, subject to the following provisions:
         A.   Alteration or Reconstruction of a Building Occupied by a
Nonconforming Use.  No building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use
shall be altered, improved, or reconstructed except when the use is changed to
a use permitted in the district in which it is located or upon prior approval
of the Planning Commission, and then only if the cumulative cost of the
alteration, reconstruction, or improvement does not exceed fifty percent (50%)
of the building's replacement value. However, no such building shall be
enlarged or expanded to increase the nonconforming use.
         B.   Expansion or Relocation of Nonconforming Use of Land. A
nonconforming use of land shall not be physically enlarged, increased,
extended, or relocated to a part of the lot that was not occupied by the use at
the time it became nonconforming. No additional structures shall be constructed
in connection with such nonconforming use.
         C.   Expansion or Relocation of Nonconforming Use of Structures. A
nonconforming use of an existing structure may be extended throughout any parts
of a building that were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the
time of adoption or amendment to this Planning and Zoning Code. However, no
such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building not
previously occupied by such nonconforming use.
         D.   Change or Substitution of Use.  A nonconforming use of a
building, structure or land shall not be changed or substituted to another
nonconforming use unless the Planning Commission, on appeal, finds that the use
proposed is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the
existing nonconforming use, and that the use proposed is in less conflict with
the character of uses permitted in the applicable zoning district than the
existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Planning Commission
may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with other
provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code. Whenever a nonconforming use is
changed to a less intensive use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a
more intensive nonconforming use.
         E.   Discontinuance of Use. Discontinuance of the nonconforming use of
a building, part of a building, lot or part of a lot for a period of twelve
(12) consecutive months or longer shall constitute voluntary abandonment of
such use and thereafter any use of the premises shall conform to the use
regulations of the district in which the building or lot is located.
         F.   Damage or Destruction. In the event a building or structure that
is occupied by a nonconforming use is destroyed by any means to the extent of
more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement value, it shall not be
rebuilt, restored or reoccupied for any use unless such use conforms to the use
regulations of the district in which the building or structure is located.
      (4)   Nonconforming Buildings or Structures. A nonconforming building or
structure may continue to be used or occupied by a use permitted in the
district in which it is located so long as it remains otherwise lawful and does
not constitute a public nuisance, subject to the following provisions:
         A.   Additions and Moving. A nonconforming building or structure shall
not be added to, enlarged or moved unless the addition(s) or part(s) moved is
made to conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
         B.   Restoration of Damaged Building or Structure. If a nonconforming
building or structure is damaged or destroyed by any means, those portions so
destroyed or damaged may be restored to the original footprint and floor area
of the building or structure, provided the reconstruction is begun within
twelve (12) months of the damage or destruction and the cumulative replacement
costs do not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the replacement cost of the building
or structure at the time of such damage. Any restoration that exceeds the
original footprint and/or floor area shall comply with subsection
1184.02(a)(4).
         C.   Change in Principal Use of Building. The principal use of a
nonconforming building may be changed to any other use permitted in the
district in which it is located so long as the new use complies with all
regulations of this Planning and Zoning Code specified for such use, except the
regulations to which the building did not conform prior to the change in use.
      (5)   Nonconforming Parking Facilities. A building or use existing
lawfully at the time of this Planning and Zoning Code, or an amendment thereto,
became or becomes effective, but which does not comply with the off-street
parking regulations for the use may continue without such parking facilities.
In the event an existing building is altered or a use is changed or substituted
in accordance with these regulations, then additional off-street parking spaces
shall be provided in compliance with Section
1184.02(a)(8).
      (6)   Nonconforming Signs. A sign, lawfully existing at the time this
Planning and Zoning Code, or any amendment thereto, became or becomes
effective, but which fails to conform to the sign regulations of the district
in which it is located is a nonconforming sign. Nonconforming signs shall
comply with the regulations set forth in Chapter
1173.
      (7)   Maintenance and Repair of Structures. Ordinary repairs, or repair
or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing may be
performed on a nonconforming structure or on any portion of a structure that
contains a nonconforming use provided that the cubic content shall not be
increased and no structural parts shall be replaced except when required by law
to restore such building or structure to a safe condition or to make the
building or structure conform to the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
      (8)   Existing Nonconforming Site Condition at the Time of Development
Plan Review. If a nonconforming site condition(s) exists when a revised
development plan is required pursuant to Section
1181.02, then such site condition(s) must be brought into compliance with
district regulations, unless the Planning Commission determines that such
conformance cannot be reasonably achieved because of existing site conditions.
In such case, the Planning Commission shall approve a development plan that
reduces the existing nonconforming site condition(s) to the maximum extent
practicable.
   (b)   Nonconforming Use Due to Reclassification. The provisions of this
Section shall also apply to any building, structure, land or other use
hereafter becoming nonconforming as a result of amendments made to this
Planning and Zoning Code or Zoning Map.
   (c)   A nonconforming lot, use, building or structure does not include
nonconformity with regulations pursuant to a legally granted variance from a
zoning regulation.
   (d)   Change from Nonconforming Use. A nonconforming building or use shall
cease to be considered as such whenever it first comes into compliance with the
regulations of the district in which it is located. Upon such compliance, no
nonconforming use shall be made, resumed or reinstated.
   (e)   Existing Use Deemed Conditional Use; Permit Required for Change. Any
lawfully existing use that, at the time of its establishment, was not
classified as a conditional use, but which now, because of the passage of this
Planning and Zoning Code, or amendment thereto, is listed as a conditional use
in the district in which it is located, shall be deemed without further action
to be a conditional use. Any change, modification, enlargement or alteration of
such use, site development conditions or signs, or change in ownership shall
only be permitted upon review and approval by the Planning Commission according
to the procedures for conditional uses set forth in Chapter
1182, Conditional Use Certificate.

1335.01 SYSTEM ESTABLISHED; MAP.
   There is hereby established a uniform system for numbering property and
buildings along all streets, avenues and other public ways within the City. For
the purpose of facilitating a correct number system, a map of all streets,
avenues and public ways, showing the proper numbers of all property fronting on
all streets, avenues and public ways shall be prepared and shall be on file in
the office of the City Engineer. This same map shall show the base lines for
the uniform system for numbering property and buildings, and shall show the
names of all streets and avenues and other public ways in the City. This map
shall be entitled “Property Numbering and Base Line Map of the City of Bryan”
and shall be the official map establishing property numbers, street names, and
base lines within the City. (Ord. 46-2024. Passed 11-18-24.)
1335.02 BASE LINES.
   (a)    Base Line Dividing the City into North and South Sections. The base
line, hereafter to be known as the north and south base line which shall divide
the City into a northern section and a southern section shall be the center
line of High Street. Hereafter all streets north of the north and south base
line and running generally in a northerly-southerly direction shall be known as
“north” streets. And likewise, all streets south of this north and south base
line running generally in a northerly-southerly direction shall be known as
“south” streets.
   (b)    Base Line Dividing City into East and West Sections. The base line,
hereafter to be known as the east and west base line, which shall divide the
City into an eastern section and a western section shall be the centerline of
Main Street. Hereafter streets east of the east and west base line and running
in a generally easterly-westerly direction shall be known as “east” streets.
And likewise, streets west of the east and west base line and running in a
generally easterlywesterly direction shall be known as “west” streets.
(Ord. 46-2024. Passed 11-18-24.)
1335.03 DIAGONAL STREETS.
   All buildings on diagonal streets shall be numbered the same as buildings on
northsouth streets if the diagonal is in a north-south direction, and shall be
numbered the same as buildings on east-west streets if the diagonal is in an
east-west direction.
(Ord. 46-2024. Passed 11-18-24.)
1335.04 NUMBERING SYSTEM.
   The numbering of property on each street shall begin at the appropriate base
line and such numbers shall change from 100 to the next higher hundred on the
basis of grid lines shown on the official map. These grid lines shall be spaced
twelve grid blocks per mile or every 440 feet in north-south and east-west
directions. All numbers shall be assigned on the basis of one number for each
fifteen feet of property frontage along a street. All property on the right
hand side of a street as one leaves a base line and proceeds outward shall bear
even numbers, and likewise all buildings on the left hand side of the street as
one leaves a base line and proceeds outward shall bear odd numbers.
   (a)    Building Numbers. A building shall be assigned the number assigned to
the fifteen-foot interval of street frontage in which its main entrance lies.
If the main entrance of the building falls exactly upon the line that divides a
fifteenfoot interval from another fifteen-foot interval, the number assigned to
either interval may be assigned to the building entrance.
   (b)    More Than One Entrance. Where a building has a number of entrances,
each serving a separate occupant, then each entrance shall be assigned a
separate number provided that there shall be enough numbers assigned to the lot
in which the building is located to provide a number for each entrance. In the
event there are not sufficient numbers assigned to the lot to serve each
separate entrance, each separate entrance shall carry the principal number plus
a suitable letter suffix.
   (c)    Multi-Family Dwellings. A multi- family dwelling having only one main
entrance shall be assigned only one number and separate apartments in the
building will carry a letter designation such as A, B, C, in addition to the
number assigned to the main entrance of the building.
   (d)    Apartment Projects with More than One Building. In the case of an
apartment project containing two or more apartment buildings, one of the
numbers assigned to the property on which it is located shall be assigned to
the total project. In addition, each building shall be numbered beginning with
the number 1. Finally, each apartment in a particular building shall be
assigned a letter designation in addition to the number of the building in
which it is located.
   (e)    Extended Streets. All building facing streets not extended through
the base line shall be assigned the same relative number as if the street had
extended to the base line.
      (Ord. 46-2024. Passed 11-18-24.)
1335.05 ASSIGNMENT OF NUMBERS.
   After a house or building is assigned its respective number or numbers, the
owner, occupant or agent shall place or cause to be placed upon each house or
building controlled by him the number or numbers assigned to such house or
building under the system established by this chapter.
   (a)    Effective Date of Numbers. The numbers assigned under the provisions
of this Chapter shall be placed on such houses and buildings within thirty (30)
days after such numbers are assigned.
   (b)    Cost; Size. The cost of numbers shall be borne by the property owner.
The numbers used shall be not less than three inches in height and shall be
made of durable and clearly visible material.
   (c)    Placing of Numbers. The numbers shall be conspicuously placed
immediately above or at the side of the proper door of each building or house
so that the number can be seen plainly from the street line. Whenever any
building or house is situated more than fifty feet from the street line, such
numbers shall be placed near the walk, driveway or common entrance to such
building or house, or upon a gate post, fencepost, tree or other appropriate
place so as to be easily discernable from the sidewalk.
      (Ord. 46-2024. Passed 11-18-24.)
1335.06 OBTAINING NUMBERS; CONFLICT; NEW BUILDINGS.
   (a)    Conflict of Numbers. It shall be the duty of the City Engineer to
inform any party applying therefore of the numbers or number belonging to or
embraced within the limits of any lot or property as provided in this chapter.
In the case of conflict as to the proper number to be assigned to any building,
the City Engineer shall determine the number of such building.
   (b)    New Buildings. Whenever any building is erected or located in the
City after the establishment of the uniform system has been completed, it shall
be the duty of the owner to procure the correct number or numbers as designated
from the City Engineer for the property and to immediately fasten the number or
numbers so assigned upon such building as provided by this Chapter. A work
permit shall not be issued for any house, building or structure until the owner
has procured from the City Engineer the official number of the premises. The
Zoning Administrator shall withhold final approval of any structure erected,
repaired, altered or modified until permanent and proper numbers have been
affixed to such structure.
(Ord. 46-2024. Passed 11-18-24.)
1335.07 STREET NAMES.
   For the purpose of clarifying and systematizing the present street names in
the City, the Planning Commission shall examine all street names within the
City and when it finds duplication of street names or similarity of street
names which might cause confusion, or when it finds street names that will
cause difficulty in the assigning of numbers, it shall then recommend
appropriate name changes to Council. (Ord. 46-2024. Passed 11-18-24.)

shall not approve the plat if the proposed names conflict with existing street
names.

chapter. The numbers assigned to the various lots shall be approved by the City
Engineer.
