affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative

proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability.  Such enactment
shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act
committed in violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an

provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and recodification.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE:  Source material for the Codified Ordinances of East
Liverpool was either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council or new matter
ordained by the Adopting Ordinance.  Sections of the Codified Ordinances
without any history indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance.  In the following table, the disposition of all source
material in the East Liverpool Codified Ordinances is indicated.

   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law

101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

(ORC 731.02)
121.03  VACANCY.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, when the office of a

office before the end of his term or because a member-elect fails to take
office, the vacancy shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term by
a person chosen by the residents of the City who are members of the county
central committee of the political party by which the last occupant of that
office or the member-elect was nominated.  If the vacancy occurs in the office

more than one member from the ward where the vacancy exists, the members of the
City controlling committee representing that ward shall choose the person to
fill the vacancy.
   (b)   Not less than five nor more than forty-five days after a vacancy

notify each committee member eligible to vote on filling the vacancy by first
class mail of the date, time and place of the meeting and its purpose.  A
majority of all eligible committee members constitutes a quorum, and a majority

so vacated took place at a nonpartisan election, or if the office was occupied
by, or was to be occupied by a person not nominated at a primary election, or

require access to a City credit card.  In addition, the Mayor/designee shall
determine the appropriate credit limit for those individuals/cards.
   Before receiving a City credit card, authorized employees must complete an
acknowledgement of receipt of this policy.
   (b)   Policy.  The City credit card is issued solely for the purpose of
conducting City business and is not to be used for any personal expenses. 
Personal and/or unauthorized usage of a City credit card may be immediate
grounds for revocation of the credit card and disciplinary action up to and
including termination of employment.  Reimbursement to the City for any
outstanding unauthorized charges may be recovered through payroll deduction and
such other means as may be necessary.  The use of a City credit card to
purchase goods or services does not waive any City purchasing procedures. 
Pursuant to the Ohio State Auditor’s Office, employees are prohibited from
taking personal advantage of frequent flier miles or credit card points when
utilizing a City credit card for City business.
   The City recognizes that the credit card provides convenience to employees
in acquiring goods and services for the City.  The City also recognize the risk
inherent with credit card usage.  Therefore, whenever a vendor will accept a
City purchase order, a purchase order should be used in lieu of the City credit
card.
   For individual expenditures, the expense must fall within pre-approved
budgets, and an approved expense appropriation request form must be submitted
to the Mayor/designee prior to incurring the expense.  Signed receipts must be
turned in to the Department Head within two (2) business days.  If an employee
is out of town during the expenditure, signed receipts should be turned in
within two (2) business days of returning the work.
   Employees must surrender all City credit cards upon their separation of
employment from the City or when requested by the Mayor/designee.
   In the event the card is lost or stolen, the cardholder must immediately
notify the Mayor/designee as soon as reasonably possible.  The employee is to
assist the Mayor/designee in identifying and resolving any charges made to the
account.
(Ord. 2, 2016.  Passed 1-19-16.)
171.17  SOCIAL MEDIA/NETWORKING POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this policy is to make an employee aware of
his or her privacy rights and prohibited conduct with respect to an employee’s

employee’s assigned tasks and duties.

etc.) during an employee’s hours of work.  Employees found to have violated
this policy may be subject to discipline up to and including termination. 
Nothing in this policy is meant to prohibit access to any website or blog which
may be work related.
      (2)   Off Duty Conduct:  An employee enjoys no expectation of privacy to
information posted into cyberspace even while off duty.  This includes anything
posted to a social networking website, Blog, or other similar internet forum of
communication.  although information may be posted to a “private” webpage, the
employee should be aware this information can still be accessed by the public
and other sources in a number of ways.  Because of this, an employee needs to
use “common-sense” and good judgment when posting comments, photos, opinions,
or any other information.  By no means is this policy meant to infringe upon an
individual’s First Amendment rights.  However, anything that reflects
negatively on the Employer, or its mission, may be used as grounds for
discipline up to and including termination.  Unacceptable conduct includes but
is not limited to:
         A.   Posting pictures, videos, or comments that are insubordinate with

Employer, supervisors, coworkers, public officials, or those who have a
relationship with the Employer. This also includes disparagement of a
fictitious character or computer-generated likeness that resembles the above.

official training, activities, or work-related assignments without the express
permission of the Department Head and/or Service-Safety Director.  This

(City or Department).
   (g)   Confidential Information.  An employee shall not disclose any work-
related confidential or proprietary information on any social networking
website, blog, or other internet forum of communication.  This can include
information that may eventually be obtained through a valid public record’s
request.
   (h)   Employee’s found to have violated any part of this policy may be
subject to discipline up to and including termination.
   (i)   Any deviation from the above policy shall require express approval by
the Employer.
   (j)   Any questions regarding the policy should be directed to the
employee’s Department Head or Service-Safety Director.
   (k)   Employees shall not operate or maintain a website that creates the
appearance of being an official representation of the City’s business. 
Exceptions must have the prior written approval of the Mayor.  (Ord. 68, 2015.

COMMISSIONER.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Tax Commissioner shall proceed in
such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base his estimate of the tax due.  As soon as the Tax Commissioner procures
such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the
assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who
has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and
remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the
tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter.  In case such
determination is made, the Tax Commissioner shall give notice of the amount so
assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in  the United States
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known
place of business.  Such operator may, within ten days after the serving or
mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the Tax Commissioner for
a hearing on the amount assessed.  If application by the operator for a hearing
is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if
any, determined by the Tax Commissioner shall become final and conclusive and
immediately due and payable.
   If such application is made, the Tax Commissioner shall give not less than
five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to
show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount specified
therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties.  At such
hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax,
interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax
Commissioner shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter
give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such
determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties.  The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is
taken as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 1, 1983.)
181.12  APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Tax Commissioner with respect
to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the
Board of Review by filing a notice of appeal with it within ten days of the
serving or mailing of the determination of tax due.  The Board shall fix a time
and place for hearing such appeal, and shall give notice in writing to such
operator at his last known place of business.  The findings of the Board shall
be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner
prescribed above for service of notice and hearing.  Any amount found to be due
shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 1, 1983)
181.13  ACTIONS TO COLLECT.

the City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action
brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 1, 1983.)
181.14  DISPOSITION OF MONEYS.

period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in such municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid

subsection (b)(1)A., B., and C., hereof, or such of the aforesaid percentages
as are applicable to the particular taxpayer and dividing the total so obtained
by the number of percentages used in deriving such total.

method does not conflict with any provisions of the Ordinance). Net profits,

municipal corporation regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered

within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion;
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property shipped from a place within
such municipal corporation to purchasers outside such municipal corporation
regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the

extent that the rental, ownership, management or operation of the real estate
from which such rents are derived (whether so rented, managed or operated by
the taxpayer individually or through agents or other representatives)
constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in part.
      (1)   Where the gross monthly rental of any real properties, regardless
of number and value, aggregate in excess of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per
month, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental, ownership, management
or operation of such properties is a business activity of such taxpayer, and
the net income of such rental properties shall be subject to tax; provided that
in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a
business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or fluctuating percentage
of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the lessee, whether or not such
rental exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month; provided further that
in the case of farm property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a
business activity when he shares in the crops or when the rental is based on a
percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from the farm, whether or not
the gross income exceeds one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200) per year;
and provided further that the person who operates a rooming house of five or
more rooms rented shall be considered in the business whether or not the gross
income exceeds three hundred dollars ($300.00) per month.

all other types of real estate.

net income from rentals (to the extent above specified), regardless of the
location of the real property owned.
      (7)   Non-residents of the Municipality are subject to such taxation only
if the real property is situated within this Municipality. Non-residents, in
determining whether gross monthly rentals exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00)
shall take into consideration only real estate situated within this
Municipality.

liability companies, limited liability partnerships, and other associations,

      (2)    The amount of tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)    Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Tax Administrator may require, including but not limited to
copies of all W-2 forms, 1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms, form 1040, Form 1120,
1120S (including (K-1 ), 2106, 1065, Schedule C (including cost of goods
manufactured and/or sold), Schedule E, schedule F and any other Federal
Schedules if applicable.
   (d)    The taxpayer, in addition to the forms and schedules in subsection
(c)(3) above, may file copies of any other documents the taxpayer considers as
necessary.
   (e)   The return shall also show the amount of the tax imposed on such
earnings and profit. The taxpayer making the return shall, at the time of the
filing thereof, pay to the Tax Administrator the amount of taxes shown as due
thereon. Provided, however, that where any portion of the tax shall have been
paid by such taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
183.05 and/or Section
183.06 of this chapter, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from
the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and
payable at the time of filing the final return.
   (f)    Joint Filing. A husband and wife may file, in any tax year, a joint
tax return. Husband and wife are liable jointly and severally for payment of
the tax associated with the joint return. A husband and wife's tax return shall
be deemed a joint return whenever the facts indicate that the taxpayers
intended to have the filed tax return be a joint return. Conclusive indications
of such intention include when the husband and wife both signed the tax return,
when the return reports both spouses' income or when the husband and wife were
both required to file tax returns, but only one spouse filed a tax return.
   (g)    Extensions. The Tax Administrator shall extend the time for filing of
the annual City return upon the filing of a copy of the taxpayer's request for
a federal extension. For tax years prior to 2004, no extension may exceed six
(6) months or one (1) month beyond the extension requested of or granted by the
Internal Revenue Service for filing of the federal income tax return, and will
not be approved for a period less than the federal extension request. For the
taxable year 2004, the extended due date shall be the last day of the month
following the month to which the due date of the federal income tax return has
been extended. The request for extension shall be filed not later than the last
day for filing the municipal income tax return as prescribed by ordinance or
rule of the City of East Liverpool income tax. The City may require a tentative
return accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon by
the date the return is normally due. The City of East Liverpool may deny a
taxpayer's request for an extension only if the taxpayer fails to timely file
the request, fails to file a copy of the request for the federal extension,
owes this municipality any delinquent income tax or any penalty, interest,
assessment, or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax,
or has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or other related
document for a prior tax period. The granting of an extension for filing this
Municipality's income tax return does not extend the last
date for paying the tax without penalty unless this municipality grants an
extension of the date.
   (h)    In the computation of any tax due under this section, a business loss
of a previous tax year shall not be allowed or carried forward to reduce the
tax due in any subsequent year.
   (i)    Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's tax liability to the City, the taxpayer
shall make and file an amended return showing income subject to the City tax,
based upon the final determination of Federal tax liability, and shall pay any
additional tax due or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (j)    An officer or employee of an employer who has control or supervision
of, or is charged with responsibility for filing the City income tax report or
paying the City income tax withheld for employees, shall be personally liable
for failure to file the report and/or for failure to pay the City income tax
withheld. Dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization of an employer shall not
discharge an officer's or employee's personal liability for a prior failure of
the employer to file City income tax returns and/or to pay City income tax due
or withheld on behalf of employees.
   (k)    All employers, businesses, contractors or subcontractors who do work
in the City shall register with the Income Tax Department of the City and shall
present thereto a list of all employees, subcontractors, contractors or others
who may do work for them whose profits, wages or earnings are not presently
subject to withholding of the East Liverpool City Income Tax before they begin
doing business therein. Further, all employers, businesses, contractors or
subcontractors have a continuing duty to notify the City Income Tax Department
of any additional employees, subcontractors, contractors or others when such
new employee, subcontractor, contractor or other is hired or contracted with or
by such employer, business, contractor or subcontractor. There shall be no cost
for the registration of any business, employee, contractor or subcontractors
thereof.
   (l)   Tax Registration Requirements for Construction Permits.
      (1)   All contractors involved in any project within the incorporated
City limits whether general contractor, subcontractor or other, must be
identified and registered with the City Income Tax Department before any permit
from the Housing, Planning and Zoning Office will be issued for the project.
The general contractor, or owner if self-contracted, is responsible for
notifying any additional contractors brought into the project after the start
of the project that income tax registration is required.
      (2)    In the event that an unregistered contractor is discovered
performing work within the City limits, the City Income Tax Department shall
have the authority to stop the project until such time as contractor or
contractors are in compliance. The City Income Tax Department shall also have
the authority to stop any project where the contractor or contractors are
registered but one or more is delinquent in filing City income tax or paying
City income tax with the City Income Tax Department.
      (3)    All contractors, including the owner if the project was self-
contracted, shall provide a listing of any and all contractors or
subcontractors who worked with or for them during the tax year within the City
limits with such list to be included with the annual income tax return of the
contractor or owner.
   (m)    All new businesses, employers, contractors, developers,
subcontractors or any other such person or entity must register with the City
Income Tax Department before they will be eligible to receive any City services
including but not limited to, City utilities. Each new resident of the City
shall register with the Tax Department of the City within thirty (30) days of
residence in the City. There shall be no cost for this registration.
   (n)    Landlords of residential, commercial or other property within the
City of East Liverpool are required to submit a report to the City Income Tax
Department listing new adult tenants whether by lease, sublease or other such
agreement in any rental property owned by landlord within the City limits, and
also listing tenants who have moved from said rental properties during the
reporting period. The reports shall be filed at the time of annual license
payment or when new tenants move into the unit/units. Penalties for non-filing
shall be assessed in accordance with Section
183.12 .
   (o)    Consolidated Returns.
      (1)    Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for federal
income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue Code may
file a consolidated return with the City. However, once the affiliated group
has elected to file a consolidated return or a separate return with the City,
the affiliated group may not change their method of filing in any subsequent
tax year without written approval from the City.
      (2)    In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the City
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Administrator shall
require such additional information as the Administrator may deem necessary to
ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the City. If the
Administrator finds net profits are not properly allocated to the City by
reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by
stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, the
Administrator shall make such allocation as the Administrator deems appropriate
to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the City.
   (p)    Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this Chapter.
   (q)    Losses from a business cannot be used to offset wages or other types
of nonbusiness
income.  (Ord. 60-2012.  Passed 11-19-12)

or other compensation the tax of one and one-half percent (1.5%) of salaries,

interest of the City to do so.
   (b)    If the amount of the tax due is five hundred dollars ($500.00) or

Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted on a monthly basis, due on or
before the last day of the month following the month for which the taxes were
withheld.
   (c)    Such return shall be on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
Such employer, in collecting the tax, shall be deemed to hold the same as
trustee for the benefit of the City until payment is made by the employer to
the City, and any such tax collected by such employer from his employee shall,
until same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such
employer.

corporations and associations shall be accompanied by a payment of at least
one-fourth the estimated tax required to be paid by this section, and at least

twelve- month period and the taxpayer filed a return for that year, or has
remitted an amount equal to ninety percent (90%) of the estimated liability for
the current year for which estimated payments have been made.

183.17  REFUNDS.
   (a)    Should it appear that any taxpayer has paid more than the amount of
the tax to which the City is entitled under the provisions of this chapter, a
refund or credit of the amount so overpaid shall be made, provided a proper
claim for refund of such overpayment of tax has been filed by the taxpayer
within three years of the due date or filing date of the tax return, whichever
is later. However, the following shall apply regarding refunds of tax withheld
from non-qualified deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)    A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP. The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP. Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)    A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a
NDCP, and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP
and upon which municipal tax was withheld, then a refund will be issued on the
amount representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed
and the income received from the NDCP. If different tax rates are applied to
the tax years in which there are deferrals, a weighted average of the different
tax rates will be used to compute the refund amount. Refunds shall be allowed
only if the loss is attributable to the bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the NDCP, or the employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of
the employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified
compensation.
   (b)    Income tax that has been deposited with the City of East Liverpool,
but should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the
City of East Liverpool as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation
on refunds.  Income tax that should have been deposited with the City of East
Liverpool, but was deposited with another municipality, shall be subject to
recovery by the City of East Liverpool.
   (c)    Overwithholding - If more than the amount of tax required to be
deducted by the Ordinance is withheld from an employee's pay, such excess may
be refunded by the employer' or Administrator, depending upon the circumstances
and the time when the overwithholding is determined as follows:
      (1)    Current employees:
         A.   If the overwithholding is discovered in the same month, the
employer shall make the necessary adjustment directly with the employee and the
amount to be reported on the Employer's Municipal Tax Withholding Statement as
withheld shall be the corrected amount.
         B.   If the overwithholding is discovered in a subsequent month of the
same calendar year, the employer may make proper adjustment with the employee.
In such case, the Employer's Municipal Tax Withholding Statement for the month
in which the adjustment is made shall reflect the total amount actually
withheld for the month and the amount of the adjustment deducted therefrom.
Also, an amended Form must be filed for the month in which the error occurred
reflecting the adjustment.
         C.   If the overwithholding is discovered in a subsequent month of the
following calendar year, the employee must make and file a request for a
refund. This request is to be filed on a form prescribed by and obtainable from
the Administrator.
      (2)    Former employees:
         A.   In the cases where an amount is in excess of the tax which has
been withheld from an employee who is no longer employed by the employer, the
Administrator shall refund the amount of such excess withholding to the
employer.
         B.   If the error is discovered by the employee, such employee shall
file a claim with the Administrator and upon verification thereof by the
employer, the Administrator shall refund the amount of such excess withholding
to the employee.
         C.   Insufficient Withholding- If Jess than the amount of tax required
to be deducted is withheld from the employee and is discovered in the same
year, such deficiency shall be withheld from subsequent wages. If the employee/
employer relationship has terminated, or if the underwithholding is discovered
in a later year and the employee/employer relationship still exists, the
employer shall notify the Administrator of such deficiency and the reason
therefore, and payment shall be made by the employer in conformity with Section
181.05 of these Regulations.
         D.   Annual Reconciliation- On or before February 28th following any
calendar year in which such deductions have been made by any employer, such
employer shall file with the Administrator, in the form prescribed by the
Administrator, an information return for each employee from whom municipal
income tax has been withheld showing the name, address, and social security
number of the employee, the total amount of taxable compensation paid during
the year and the amount of municipal income tax withheld for East Liverpool
from each employee.
         E.   Reconciliation Return- In addition to such information returns
and at the time the same are filed, such employer shall file with the
Administrator a reconciliation form (as prescribed by the Administrator) to
enable the Administrator to reconcile the sum total of taxes withheld as
disclosed by the total W-2 Forms. The reconciliation form shall also reconcile
to prior remittances and returns filed by the employer for such tax year with
respect to taxes withheld.
         F.   All employers that provide any contractual service within East
Liverpool City and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service
shall provide East Liverpool the names and address of the subcontractors. The
subcontractors shall be responsible for all income tax withholding requirements
under East Liverpool's ordinance.  (Ord. 60-2012.  Passed 11-19-12.)

Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this chapter, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:

         (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the

   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax

division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the

successor entity.
   (E)    (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute

   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)    (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid

first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
187.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section
187.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,

corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041

person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was

be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video

lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a  copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.

penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.

section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:

         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the

      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

187.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

inquiry, review, court martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C) (1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from

sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.

corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)    (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
187.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11 )(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
187.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.

return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.

taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)    The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)    A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B) (1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
187.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
187.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
187.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is

"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)    A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (d)    Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent

estimated taxes.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
187.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax

balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C) (1) (a)
through (d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
187.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's

liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section
187.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by

         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
187.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

   No Credit is given for taxes paid/withheld by another municipality or other
like entity.
(Ord. 56, 2015.  Passed 11-2-15.)
187.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121 (v) (2) (C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)    (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
"qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)    (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)    If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)    (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 56, 2015.  Passed 11-2-15.)
187.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
187.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 56, 2015.  Passed 11-2-15.)
187.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
187.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)    Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
187.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other Municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)    No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
187.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)    Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
187.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of

         (c)    In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)    With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
187.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
187.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
187.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)    (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a

before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the

      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
187.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation

colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.

The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination

to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)    The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)    The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: 'The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the

information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year.
      Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator
from performing an audit of the person.

States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

   (B)    (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in

otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)

the provisions of its municipal income
tax.

month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal

   (C)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the

state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B) (2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section 187.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)    (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2)) of
this section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the

of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C) (2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in section
187.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  (56, 2015.  Passed 11-2-15.)
187.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)    (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
187.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A) (4) of Section 187.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or

person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter

the request was directed pursuant to section
187.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
187.99 of this Chapter.

identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section 187.10 of this
Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B) (1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
187.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
187.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 56, 2015.  Passed 11-2-15.)
187.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue

   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 56, 2015.  Passed 11-2-15.)
187.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,

this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity
or transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)    If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts
or omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
187.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 56, 2015.  Passed 11-2-15.)
187.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)    (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of  the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail.
   Such alternative delivery method must be authorized by the person subject to
the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B) (1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person.
   Nothing in this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official
from entering into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually
file such an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 56, 2015.  Passed 11-2-15.)
187.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF  TAX REVIEW.

Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code

Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment.
One member shall be appointed by the top administrative official of the
Municipality. This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but may not
be the Director of Finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or
other similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax
matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the  the Municipality shall serve at the discretion
of the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11 (A) (4) of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)    The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 56, 2015.  Passed 11-2-15.)
187.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)    (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax .was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1 )(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
187.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding , or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the

   (D)    (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
187.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
187.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division

4513.611.
      (2)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.

to 4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (f)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private
agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in
accordance with Section
303.082.
   (g)   Whoever violates subsection (e) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.60)
303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
         C.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times, the
times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
         D.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:
         A.   It is located within twenty-five linear miles of the location of
the private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to
a place of storage within twenty-five linear miles.
         B.   It is well-lighted.
         C.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly scheduled
route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow-away zone is located.
   (b)   (1)   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established
as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4505.101.  The owner or  lienholder of a
vehicle that has been removed under this section, subject to subsection (c) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with subsection (g) of this
section.
      (2)   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be  licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken
under this section.  The towing service shall retain the photographs and the
record of the time and date, in electronic or printed form, for at least thirty
days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be
recovered;
         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular vehicle to a person who, either in person or pursuant to a
telephone call, identifies self as the owner, operator or lienholder of the
vehicle, and requests information pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three days of the removal, the towing service or
storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause a search
to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle.  The Registrar
of Motor Vehicles shall insure that such information is provided in a timely
manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if
the vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known
address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested or by a
commercial carrier service utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed
receipt;
         B.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed thirty days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under subsection (f)(1)A. of this
section;
         C.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed forty-five days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under subsection (f)(1)A. of this
section.
      (2)   Sixty days after any notice sent pursuant to subsection (f)(1) of
this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under
subsection (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101, may initiate the process for obtaining a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle as provided in that section.
      (3)   A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a signed
receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible, shall not
obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to the motor
vehicle under division (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101.
      (4)   With respect to a vehicle concerning which a towing service or
storage facility is not eligible to obtain title under Ohio R.C. 4505.101, the
towing service or storage facility need only comply with the initial notice
required under subsection (f)(1)A. of this section.

period of time that the vehicle was in the possession of the towing service or
storage facility prior to the date the lienholder received the notice sent
under subsection (f)(1)A. of this section;
            2.   If notice has been sent to the owner and lienholder as
described in subsection (f) of this section, a processing fee of twenty-five

      (2)   A towing service or storage facility in possession of a vehicle
that is removed under authority of subsection (b) of this section shall show
the vehicle owner, operator or lienholder who contests the removal of the
vehicle all photographs taken under subsection (d) of this section.  Upon
request, the towing service or storage facility shall provide a copy of all
photographs in the medium in which the photographs are stored, whether paper,
electronic, or otherwise.
      (3)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (4)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by

to sign a waiver of liability.  For purposes of subsection (g)(4) of this
section, “personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the
vehicle.
   (h)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of any vehicle from
private property that is established as a private tow-away zone under this
section, or store such a vehicle other than in accordance with this section, or
otherwise fail to comply with any applicable requirement of this section.
   (i)   This section does not affect or limit the operation of Ohio R.C.

   (EDITOR’S NOTE:  The provisions of former Section
303.083 as amended are now codified in Section
303.081.)
303.09  LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.  (ORC
4513.64)
303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a first offense.  If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this
section, whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree.  If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to
two or more violations of this section, whoever violates this section is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the third degree. (ORC 4513.65)
303.11  PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO POLICE OFFICER.

false name, social security number or date of birth to a law enforcement
officer who is in the process of issuing to the person a traffic ticket or
complaint.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first

person upon whom the liability is imposed.
   (b)   The Chief of Police shall be responsible for administering the
automated speed enforcement program.  The Chief of Police shall be empowered to
take the actions necessary to create and operate the automated speed
enforcement system within the City in accordance with law, including complying
with all of the prerequisites to implementing a traffic law photo- monitoring
system set forth in Ohio Revised Code Section 4511.094 and Section 4511.095.
   (c)   The City Police Officers may utilize a traffic law photo-monitoring
device for the purpose of detecting traffic law violations.  The Police Officer
shall be present at the location of the device at all times during the
operation of the device.
(Ord. 17, 2017.  Passed 2-6-17.)
309.03  OFFENSE COMMITTED; PROOF OF VIOLATION.
   (a)   If a traffic law photo-monitoring device records a traffic law
violation, and a law enforcement officer was present at the location of the
traffic law photo-monitoring device at the time of the violation, the City of
East Liverpool Police Department may issue a ticket for a civil violation in
accordance with sections 4511.092 to 4511.0912 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   The vehicle owner shall be issued a ticket for a civil penalty if a
traffic law photo- monitoring device records a traffic law violation showing
that a vehicle is operated at a speed in excess of those set forth in section
4511.21 or 4511.211 of the Ohio Revised Code, provided that:
      (1)   For a system location that is located within a school zone or

involved in the violation is traveling at least ten miles per hour over the
posted speed limit.
   (c)   A City of East Liverpool Police Officer shall examine evidence of
alleged traffic law violations recorded by the device to determine whether such
a violation has occurred.  If the image recorded by the traffic law photo-
monitoring device shows such a violation, contains the date and time of the
violation, and shows the letter and numerals on the license plate of the
vehicle involved as well as the state that issued the license plate, the
officer may use any lawful means to identify the registered owner.
   (d)   The fact that a person or entity is the registered owner of a motor
vehicle is prima facie evidence that the person or entity is the person who was
operating the vehicle at the time of the traffic law violation.
   (e)   Within thirty days of the traffic law violation, the City of East
Liverpool Police Department or its designee may issue and send by regular mail
a ticket charging the registered owner with the violation.  The ticket shall
comply with section 4511.097 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (f)   A certified copy of the ticket alleging a traffic law violation, sworn
to or affirmed by a City of East Liverpool Police Officer, including by
electronic means, and the recorded images produced by the traffic law photo-
monitoring device, is prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein and
is admissible in a proceeding for review of the ticket issued.

procedure for disclaiming liability by submitting an affidavit as prescribed in
any of those sections;
      (11)   A warning that failure to exercise one of the options prescribed
in Ohio R.C. 4511.098 is deemed to be an admission of liability and waiver of
the opportunity to contest the violation.
      (12)   The date of issuance of the ticket.
   (b)   A ticket issued under this section shall be mailed no later than
thirty (30) calendar days after the alleged traffic law violation.

designated party; or
         B.   An affidavit by the vehicle owner stating that at the time of the
violation, the motor vehicle or the license plates of the motor vehicle
involved were stolen or were in the care, custody, and control of some person
who did not have the owner’s permission to use the motor vehicle, or that the
motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the
violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at
the time of the violation.  In order to demonstrate that the motor vehicle or
license plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the
control or possession of the vehicle owner at the time of the violation, the
vehicle owner must submit proof that a police report, incident report/general
offense report about the stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed prior

within thirty days after the date of mailing of the ticket, the registered
owner furnishes an affidavit specified in to the City in a form established by
the City and the following conditions are met:
      (1)   If the registered owner submits an affidavit as specified in

violation detected by a traffic law photo-monitoring device is not liable for a
ticket issued for a motor vehicle that was in the care, custody, or control of
a lessee or renter at the time of the alleged violation.  The dealer shall not

an admission of liability and waiver of the opportunity to contest the
violation.
   (e)   In the event that the City of East Liverpool and/or East Liverpool
Police Department receives from a registered owner an affidavit described in
subsection (c)(2)A. or B. hereof or a notice described in subsection (d)(4)
hereof, the City may proceed to send a ticket to the designated party.  The
City shall send the ticket to the designated party not later than twenty- one
days after receipt of the affidavit or notification.

therein and shall be admissible in a proceeding alleging a traffic law
violation under this chapter.

numbers or the state that issued the license plate number on the vehicle.
      (4)   Evidence, other than that adduced pursuant to subsection (b)(1)
hereof, that the registered owner or person named in the ticket was not

ticket was not operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation or
receives evidence under subsection (b)(4) hereof identifying the designated
party, the hearing officer shall provide it to the City of East Liverpool or
its designee within five (5) calendar days, along with a copy of any evidence

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC

313.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of- way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic

subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender

term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the

attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol

monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court’s indigent drivers’ alcohol
treatment fund.
   (l)   Appeal Does Not Stay Operation of License Suspension.  If a person
whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended under this section files an appeal regarding
any aspect of the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay
the operation of the suspension.
   (m)   Subsection (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who

   (o)   Conflict of Terms.  All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to
this section.  If the meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C . 4510.01 conflicts

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

or a valid commercial driver’s license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
   (b)   No person shall receive a driver's license, or a motorcycle operator's
endorsement of a driver's or commercial driver's license, unless and until he
surrenders to the Registrar all valid licenses issued to him by another
jurisdiction recognized by the State of Ohio.  No person shall be permitted to
have more than one valid license at any time. 
(ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.  The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case.  If, within three years of the

or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4507.02 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order.  The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima-facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has

   (a)   The City Parking Violations Bureau is hereby established pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 4521.04.  The Parking Violations Bureau shall be within the office of
the Clerk of the Service- Safety Director.  The Parking Violations Bureau has
jurisdiction over each parking infraction that occurs within the territory of
the City of East Liverpool.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
contrary, each parking infraction that occurs within the jurisdiction of the
Parking Violations Bureau and the enforcement of each such parking infraction
shall be handled pursuant to and be governed by the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   The operating costs of the Parking Violations Bureau shall be paid by
the City.  The Clerk of the Service-Safety Director’s Office is hereby
appointed as the Violations Clerk of the Parking Violations Bureau, with
authority to appoint deputy clerks and hearing examiners.  No person shall be
employed as a hearing examiner unless the person is an attorney admitted to the
practice of law in this State or formerly was employed as a law enforcement
officer.
   (c)   The fines, penalties, fees and costs established for a parking
infraction shall be collected, retained, and disbursed by the Violations Clerk
if the parking infraction out of which the fine, penalties, fees and costs
arose occurred within the jurisdiction of the Parking Violations Bureau.  The

paid in satisfaction of judgments and default judgments entered pursuant to
this chapter.  All contracts entered into by the Clerk of Court shall be
subject to approval of City Council.
(Ord. 3, 2007.  Passed 3-5-07.)
351.16  PARKING TICKET, SERVICE AND LIABILITY.
   (a)   The parking ticket adopted in subsection (b) hereof shall be used by
law enforcement officers in all cases in which a  person is charged with
committing a parking infraction within the City.  The parking ticket shall be
the summons and complaint for purposes of this chapter.
   (b)   A law enforcement officer and/or ticketing agent working for the City
who issues a parking ticket for a parking infraction shall complete the ticket
by identifying the parking infraction charged, recording the license plate
number, type and make or model of the vehicle, and indicating the date, time,
and place of the parking infraction charged.  The officer and/or ticketing
agent shall sign the ticket and affirm the facts it contains and file a copy
with the Violations Clerk.  If the operator of the vehicle is present, the
officer also shall record on the ticket the name of the operator in a space
provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then shall
personally serve the parking ticket upon the operator.  If the operator of the
vehicle is not present, the officer shall insert the word “owner” in the space
provided on the ticket for identification of the offender, and then shall
constructively serve the parking ticket upon the owner of the vehicle by
affixing the ticket to the vehicle in a conspicuous place.
   Constructive service of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle by
affixation as provided in this subsection, or by the procedure described in
subsection (d) hereof, has the same force and effect, and potentially subjects
both the owner and the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted
in the parking infraction, if different, to the same fine, penalties, fees, and
costs for failure to timely answer or to appear, if a hearing is requested, as
if the parking ticket were personally served on both the owner and operator of
the vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (c)   The original of a parking ticket issued pursuant to this section or
any true copy of it shall be considered a record kept in the ordinary course of
business of the City and of the law enforcement agency whose officer issued it,
and shall be prima-facie evidence of the facts it contains.
   (d)   An operator of a vehicle who is not the owner of the vehicle, but who
operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner is the agent of
the owner for purposes of receipt of parking tickets served in accordance with
this section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the operator in
accordance with this section constitutes constructive service upon the owner
for purposes of this chapter.  The operator of a rented or leased vehicle whose
act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall not be
considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business of
renting or leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement and
if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Section
351.20.
   (e)   Except as provided in Section
351.20, when a parking ticket is issued for a parking infraction and is served
pursuant to this section, the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission
resulted in the parking infraction for which the ticket was issued and the
owner of the vehicle involved in the parking infraction, if different, are
jointly liable for the parking infraction and any fine, penalty, fees and costs
arising out of the parking infraction.  Any owner of a vehicle who pays any
fine, penalty, fee and cost imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to this
chapter may recover the amount paid from the operator of the vehicle whose act
or omission resulted in the parking infraction.  (Ord. 3, 2007.  Passed 3-5-
07.)
351.17  ANSWERS; PROCEDURES.
   (a)   A person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction may answer the charge by
appearing personally before the Parking Violations Bureau or by mail.  An
answer shall be made within fifteen days from the date of the infraction, and
shall be in one of the following forms:
      (1)   An admission that the person committed the parking infraction, by
payment of any fine arising out of the parking infraction;
      (2)   An admission that the person committed the parking infraction, with
an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction;
      (3)   A denial that the person committed the parking infraction and a
request for a hearing relative to the infraction.  If the person desires the
presence, at the hearing, of the law enforcement officer who issued the parking
ticket, the person must request his presence in his answer.
   (b)   (1)   A person who admits that he committed a parking infraction
shall, and a person who admits that he committed a parking infraction with
explanation may, when he makes his answer, pay the fine arising out of the
infraction admitted to the Violations Clerk of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)   A person who admits that he committed a parking infraction with
explanation shall submit evidence to the Parking Violations Bureau that
explains the circumstances surrounding the parking infraction.  The evidence
may be submitted in person or, to avoid the necessity of personal appearance,
may be sent as affidavits and other documentary evidence, by mail.  The Parking
Violations Bureau, when it receives an answer admitting that a person committed
a parking infraction with explanation, shall promptly determine whether the
explanation mitigates the fact that the person committed the parking infraction
and notify the person, in writing, of its determination.
If the Parking Violations Bureau determines that the explanation mitigates the
fact that the person committed the parking infraction, the Parking Violations
Bureau shall eliminate or reduce the amount of the fine arising out of the
parking infraction.  If the fine is eliminated or reduced and the person has
previously paid the fine, the amount paid in excess of the revised fine shall
be returned to the person; if the fine is eliminated or reduced and the person
has not previously paid the fine, the person shall pay only the amount of the
revised fine.  If the Parking Violations Bureau determines that the explanation
does not mitigate the fact that the person committed the parking infraction,
the person owes the entire amount of the fine arising out of the parking
infraction, and if the person has not previously paid the fine, the person
shall pay the entire amount of the fine.  If a person admits that he committed
a parking infraction with explanation and the person fails to pay the amount of
the fine due within ten days after receiving notice of the Parking Violations
Bureau’s determination, unless the amount due has previously been paid, the
Parking Violations Bureau’s determination and the amount of the fine due shall
be considered a judgment and shall be treated as if it were a judgement
rendered subsequent to a hearing held pursuant to Section
351.19 (b).
      (3)   A person who denies that he committed a parking infraction shall be
granted a hearing concerning the infraction.  The Parking Violations Bureau
shall set a date for the hearing and notify the person, in writing, of the
date, time and place of the hearing.  The hearing shall be conducted by a
hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau in accordance with Section
351.19.
   (c)   If a person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction fails to timely answer
the charge, as provided in subsection (a) hereof, the Parking Violations Bureau
shall issue the proper notifications of infraction pursuant to Section
351.18; and proceed according to that section.  Failure to answer the charge
within the fifteen-day period provided by subsection (a) hereof, shall result
in the imposition of an additional penalty as defined in Section
351.21.
   (d)   The issuance of a parking ticket, the filing of or failure to file an
answer by a person personally or constructively served with the ticket, the
substance of an answer, the payment of any fine, penalty, fee, and cost, and
any other relevant information shall be entered in the records of the Parking

351.19  HEARING PROCEDURE.
   (a)   If a person who is personally or constructively served with a parking
ticket charging the commission of a parking infraction or who receives a
notification of infraction, in his answer to the charge denies that he
committed the infraction, the Parking Violations Bureau shall conduct a hearing
to determine if the person committed the parking infraction.  Each hearing
shall be conducted by a hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau. 
Each hearing shall be conducted in such manner as the hearing examiner
considers  appropriate.  Rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall
not be strictly applied in the hearing, but all testimony shall be under oath.
   At the hearing, the City has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that the person for whom the hearing is being conducted committed
the parking infraction.  If the person, in his answer, denied that he committed
the parking infraction and requested the presence at the hearing of the law
enforcement officer who issued the parking ticket, the officer shall be
required to attend the hearing unless the hearing examiner determines that the
officer’s presence is not required.  If the officer’s presence at the hearing
has been requested and the officer is unable to attend the hearing on the day
and at the time scheduled, the hearing examiner may grant a reasonable
continuance.  The person for whom the hearing is being conducted may present
any relevant evidence and testimony at the hearing.  The person does not have
to attend the hearing if he submits documentary evidence to the hearing
examiner prior to the day of the hearing.
   The City shall submit the original parking ticket that was personally or
constructively served on the person or a true copy of that ticket, and
information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles that identifies the owner of the
vehicle.  The ticket and the information in proper form is prima-facie evidence
that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person who committed the
parking infraction.  The City may present additional evidence and testimony at
the hearing.  The City does not have to be represented at the hearing by an
attorney.
   (b)   (1)   If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under
subsection (a) hereof, appears at the scheduled hearing or submits evidence in
accordance with that subsection, the hearing examiner shall consider all
evidence and testimony presented and shall determine whether the City has
established, by a preponderance of evidence, that the person committed the
parking infraction.  If the hearing examiner determines that the person
committed the infraction, an order indicating the determination as a judgment
against the person and requiring the person to pay the appropriate fine and any
additional penalties, fees, and costs shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
      (2)   If a person for whom a hearing is to be conducted under subsection
(a) hereof fails to appear at the scheduled hearing and fails to submit
evidence in accordance with that subsection, the hearing examiner shall, if he
determines from any evidence and testimony presented at the hearing, by a
preponderance of the evidence that the person committed the parking infraction,
enter a default judgment against the person and require the person to pay the
appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees and costs.  A default
judgment entered under this subsection shall be entered in the records of the
Parking Violations Bureau.
      (3)   If a person who is sent a notification of infraction pursuant to
Section
351.18 does not timely answer, as provided in Section
351.18(c), the hearing examiner of the Parking Violations Bureau shall, if he
determines from any evidence and testimony presented to him by the local
authority, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person committed the
parking infraction, enter a default judgment against the person and require the
person to pay the appropriate fine and any additional penalties, fees and
costs.  A default judgment entered under this subsection shall be entered in
the records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (4)   If the hearing examiner does not determine, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that a person in any of the classes described in subsection (b)
(1), (2) or (3) hereof committed the parking infraction, the hearing examiner
shall enter judgment against the City, shall dismiss the charge of the parking
infraction against the person, and shall enter the judgment and dismissal in
the records of the Parking Violations Bureau.
      (5)   A default judgment entered under this section may be vacated by the
hearing examiner who entered if it all of the following apply:
         A.   The person against whom the default judgment was entered files a
motion with the Parking Violations Bureau within one year of the date of entry
of the judgment;
         B.   The motion sets forth a sufficient defense to the parking
infraction out of which the judgment arose;
         C.   The motion sets forth excusable neglect as to the person’s
failure to attend the hearing or answer the notification of infraction.
   (c)   Payment of any judgment or default judgment entered against a person
pursuant to this section shall be made to the Violations Clerk of the Parking
Violations Bureau in which the judgment was entered within ten days of the date
of entry.  All money paid in satisfaction of a judgment or default judgment
shall be disbursed by the Violations Clerk to the City and the Violation Clerk
shall enter the fact of payment of the money and its disbursement in the
records of the Parking Violations Bureau.  If payment is not made within this
time period, the judgment or default judgment may be filed with the office of
the Clerk of Court, Civil Division, and when so filed, shall have the same
force and effect as a money judgment in a civil action rendered in the Court.
   As required by Ohio R.C. 4521.08(C), judgments and default judgments filed
with the East Liverpool Municipal Court, Office of the Clerk of Court, Civil
Division, shall be maintained in a separate index and judgment roll from other
judgments rendered in that Court.  Computer printouts, microfilm, microdot,
microfiche, and other similar data recording techniques may be utilized to
record such judgments.  When a judgment or default judgment is filed with the
Court, execution may be levied, and such other measures may be taken for its
collection as are authorized for the collection of an unpaid money judgment in
a civil action rendered in that Court.  The Municipal Court may assess costs
against the judgment debtor, in an amount not exceeding ten dollars ($10.00)
for each parking infraction, to be paid upon satisfaction of the judgment.
   (d)   Any person against whom a judgment or default judgment is entered
pursuant to this section and the City if judgment is entered against the City
pursuant to this section may appeal the judgment or default judgment to the
East Liverpool Municipal Court by filing notices of appeal with the Parking
Violations Bureau and the Municipal Court within fifteen days of the date of
entry of the judgment and by the payment of such reasonable costs as the Court
requires.  Upon the filing of an appeal, the Court shall schedule a hearing
date and notify the parties of the date, time and place of the hearing.  The
hearing shall be held by the Court in accordance with the rules of the Court. 
Service of a notice of appeal under this subsection by a person does not stay
enforcement and collection of the judgment or default judgment from which
appeal is taken by the person unless the person who files the appeal posts bond
with the Parking Violations Bureau in the amount of the judgment, plus court
costs, at or before service of the notice of appeal.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the judgment on appeal of the
Municipal Court is final, and no other appeal of the judgment of the Parking
Violations Bureau, and no appeal of the judgment of the Municipal Court may be
taken.
   (e)   A judgment or default judgment entered pursuant to this section may be
filed with the Municipal Court, Office of the Clerk of Court, Civil Division
under subsection (c) hereof at any time within three years after the date of
issuance of the parking ticket charging the parking infraction out of which the
judgment arose.  This subsection applies to any ticket issued for an offense
that would be a parking infraction on or after the effective date of Ohio R.C.
4521.08, if the ticket was issued within three years prior to the effective
date of this section and a warrant has not been issued and served on the
operator or owner of the vehicle involved in that offense.

implied consent at that time.  If the Parking Violations Bureau does not so
determine, it shall conduct the hearing concerning the infraction according to

involving the vehicle if at the time of the commission of the parking

   Proof that the vehicle was in the care, custody or control of a person other
than the owner pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement at the time of
the alleged parking infraction shall be established by sending a true copy of
the rental or lease agreement or an affidavit to that effect to the Parking
Violations Bureau within thirty days after the date of receipt by the owner of

conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is

network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same

501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
"The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or

501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section

any individual or individuals so designated shall provide an appropriate bond
to secure the faithful discharge of his or her duties with the cost thereof to
be defrayed out of the General Fund of the City and that any such individual or
individuals shall possess the qualifications and ability, and be afforded the
training necessary for the same to faithfully and adequately discharge the
duties of such position. The Animal Control Officer shall be required to obtain
the training and licensing as set forth in the “Manual of the Humane
Association Guidelines”. The fact that any individual so designated holds an
office or position with another governmental agency or a nonprofit private
corporation shall not disqualify him or her from being so appointed or so
designated, or from serving in such capacity.  (Ord. 60, 2004.  Passed 10-18-
04.)
   (b)    Any dog found running at large, at the discretion of an Animal
Control Officer, or any police officer, may be impounded and held at the
Columbiana County Dog Pound. Immediately after such dog is impounded, the
Animal Control Officer or police officer shall make every reasonable effort to
ascertain the identity and whereabouts of the owner thereof, and, if such
information may be ascertained through reasonable effort, to notify the owner
thereof, and to inform such owner of the conditions whereby custody of the
animal may be regained. All unlicensed dogs so impounded which remain unclaimed
by the owners thereof for a period of three days shall be and become the
property of the City and forthwith thereafter shall be placed for adoption in a
suitable home, or humanely destroyed, and any and all costs incident to either
procedure shall be charged against the owner of such dog, if the identity of
the owner is ascertained thereafter with reasonable certainty. Licensed dogs so
impounded and not redeemed by the owner thereof within a period of fourteen
days after the date of notice to the record owner thereof at the address
provided by a part of the licensing or registration procedure shall also be and
become the property of the City and forthwith thereafter shall be placed for
adoption in a suitable home, or humanely destroyed, and any and all costs
incident to either procedure shall be charged against the record owner of the
dog. No animal belonging to the City shall be eligible for adoption unless and
until such animal has been adequately immunized against infectious diseases and
spayed or neutered. The cost of such immunization and spaying or neutering
shall be a part of the costs incident to adoption hereunder. In the event any
dog is placed for adoption, and the City is unable through reasonable efforts
to ascertain the identity of whereabouts of the owner thereof, or to collect
therefrom the costs incident to the adoption or such animal, the costs shall be
charged against, and become the obligation of the party who adopts the dog.
   (c)    When a dog or cat is found running at large, and the identity of its
owner is verified, any Animal Control Officer or police officer in lieu of
impounding such animal may exercise the option of serving the owner with a
summons demanding the appearance of the owner before the East Liverpool
Municipal Court under the provisions of Section
505.02.
   (d)    An owner reclaiming a dog impounded under this chapter shall pay to
the City, prior to the release of such dog, an impound fee of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), together with any and all reasonable expenses related to the
housing, feeding and appropriate veterinary treatment and care thereof during
the period of the impoundment of such dog and the costs of the adequate and
appropriate immunization of such animal as may be reasonably required. Such
fees and charges shall be in addition to any and all pickup, impoundment and
licensing fees, if any, charged or imposed by Columbiana County or any agency
thereof.
   (e)    No dog impounded under this chapter shall be released or adopted
pursuant thereto absent proof that the animal, if a dog, has been properly
licensed pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 955.
   (f)    Animal Control Officers shall be responsible to police and shall
enforce the provisions of this chapter, and, with regard thereto, they shall
have such police powers and authority as are conferred upon peace or law
enforcement officers of the City; and
   (g)    In the event that an animal is destroyed or adopted pursuant to the
terms of this chapter, and the identity of the owner thereof is ascertained
thereafter with reasonable certainty, such owner shall be subject to the
appropriate penalties of this chapter, and shall be fully liable to any and all
expenses incident to the housing, feeding, veterinary care and treatment, and
immunization related to the keeping, and the adoption or destruction thereof.

keep such dog or cat immunized or reimmunized against rabies by method listed
in the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare Center for Disease
Control Animal Rabies Compendium, or any other method approved by the Health
Commissioner, so that the dog or cat is continually protected against
contracting rabies. Provided, however, dogs and cats need not be immunized
before reaching the age of three months.
   (b)    All veterinarians immunizing or reimmunizing dogs or cats against
rabies shall keep a record of such immunization or reimmunization and shall, at
the time of such immunizing or reimmunizing, give the owner or keeper of the
animal a certificate of immunization which shall include a number identifying
the individual record, a complete description of the animal, place where the
animal is kept or harbored, name and address of the owner, keeper or harborer
of the animal, date and type of immunization or reimmunization and such other
pertinent information as needed, along with the signature and typed name and
address of the veterinarian. The veterinarian shall forward a copy of the
certificate to the City Health Commissioner within thirty days of its issuance.
The Health Commissioner shall then forward a copy thereof to the Animal Control
Officer.
   (c)    The certificate described in subsection (b) hereof shall be made on
multiple copy forms certified by the Health Commissioner.
   (d)    Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to mean that dogs or
cats immunized or reimmunized shall be allowed to run at large in violation of
any rabies quarantine, law, ordinance or regulation.  (Ord. 27, 1999.  Passed
5-17-99.)
   (e)    All veterinarians who immunize or reimmunize a dog or cat against
rabies shall provide a tag approved by the Health Commissioner, which shall
have thereon permanently affixed the year of immunization or reimmunization and
the number indicating the record prescribed in subsection (b) hereof. Such tag
shall be securely fastened to the collar and/or harness worn by the dog.  (Ord.
60, 2004.  Passed 10-18-04.)
   (f)    No veterinarian or person who keeps or harbors a dog or cat shall be
required to provide or obtain a certificate for a rabies immunization or
reimmunization administered before the date this section takes effect. However,
the provisions of this section must be complied with at the time of
reimmunization thereafter or the time the current immunization or
reimmunization loses its effectiveness, whichever is earlier.

misdemeanor.

in numerous quantities.

or Planning Department.  Upon application, the Health Department and/or
Planning Department shall conduct an inspection of the permit premises to

permit applicant prior to issuance of that permit.  This permit requirement
shall be in addition to all other licensing requirements required by law,
including zoning regulations.
(Ord. 60, 2004.  Passed 10-18-04.)

360 days of the alleged violation with the Board a complaint in writing, sworn
to or affirmed, which states the name and address of the person alleged to have
committed the violation complained of and the particulars thereof, and such
other information as may be required by the Board.  The Board may also
corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of testing carried out by its
staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint, the Board shall make such
investigation as it deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues.  If the
Board determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has
occurred, the Board shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of
initial conference and persuasion with all interested parties and such
representatives as the parties may choose to assist them.  Conciliation
conferencess shall be informal and nothing said or done during such initial
conference shall be made public by the Board or any member of the Board or its
staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing  and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated.  Consent agreements
shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (d)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Board or Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation under
this chapter.
   (e)   If the Board determines that  the complaint lacks reasonable grounds
under which to base a violation of this chapter, the Board may in its
discretion dismiss such complaint or order such further investigation as may be
necessary.
   (f)   If the Board with respect to a matter which involves a violation of
this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is not
susceptible of conciliation, a public hearing shall be scheduled to determine
whether a violation of this chapter has been committed.  The Board shall serve
upon the respondent a statement of charges and a summons and shall serve upon
all interested parties a notice of the time and place of hearing.  The
respondent or his authorized counsel may file such statements with the Board
prior to the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its position. 
The hearing shall be opened to the public, except that the respondent may
request in writing a private hearing; the determination of such request shall
be descretionary with the Board.  The hearing shall be held not less than
fifteen days after service of the statement of charges and summons.  The
summons so issued shall be signed by two members of the Board and the issuance
of such summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the
production of relevant documents and records.  The failure to comply with a
summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter.  The interested parties
may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or by duly authorized
representatives and may have the assistance of an attorney.  The parties may
present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross examine witnesses shall
be preserved.  All testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by
affirmation.  The Board shall keep a full record of the hearing, which record
shall be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon request by a
principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such party a copy of
the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board determines upon the
preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has violated
this chapter, the Board, shall, after consultation with the Law Director in
executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director to prepare
and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person complained
against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take such
affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, with notice
that if the Board determines that the person complained against has not after
fifteen calendar days following service of the Board's order complied with the
order, the Board shall recertify the matter to the Law Director for
enforcement.
   (h)   Upon recertification to the Law Director for enforcement, he shall
seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Fair
Housing Board of the City before a court of competent jurisdiction.  In any
such proceeding, where the court determines that there has been a violation of
this chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages and where appropriate,
punitive damages, along with attorney's fees.  The court may also order such
other relief as it deems necessary or appropriate.
   (i)   If at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines upon a
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and publish its findings
and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose;

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection

museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on

compensate the owner for its loss.

materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

operator/driver to obtain a new inspection of a taxicab where it appears to the
officer not to be in safe operating condition by his visual observation either

cold planed on each side of the trench prior to the pavement overlay to provide
clean pavement joints, and correct surface grade, profile, and cross-section.
            2.   Excavating in one travel lane.
      If the trench is excavated in such a manner so that less than half the
entire width of the street's pavement is disturbed and within the travel way,
the final pavement patch surface course will be a one and one-half (1 1/2) inch
overlay of the entire width of the lane disturbed and will extend twenty (20)
feet beyond the trench limits longitudinally in each direction. The existing
pavement shall be cold planed on each side of the trench prior to the pavement
overlay to provide clean pavement joints, and correct surface grade, profile,
and cross-section.
            3.   Excavating in a paved shoulder or parking bay.
      If the trench is excavated in such a manner so that only the paved
shoulder or parking bay is disturbed and is not within the travelway, the final
pavement patch surface course will be a one and on-half (1 1/2) inch overlay
limited to the area disturbed so as to minimize the effects of the work on the
new pavement. The existing pavement shall be cold planed on each side of the
trench prior to the pavement overlay to provide clean pavement joints, and
correct surface grade, profile and cross-section.
            4.   Excavation at multiple locations.
      In cases where multiple excavations are made in a street that would
result in the edge of patches being (60) feet or less in distance from the next
patch, measured from the closest trench line, restoration will be in kind with
a one and one-half (1 1/2) inch wearing course overlay extending (20) feet from
the two farthest trench ends for the entire lane width. If one of the multiple
patches crosses the center line, then restoration will be in kind with a one
and one-half (1 1/2) inch wearing course overlay extending (20) feet from the
two farthest trench ends for the entire road width.
            5.   Excavation of longitudinal trenches.
      In the case of longitudinal trenches in the roadway area, full lane width
restoration will be required. Restoration will be in kind with a one and one-
half (1 1/2) inch wearing course overlay extending (20) feet from the two
furthest trench ends.
         G.   In all other areas, the excavation shall be restored to the
condition that existed before the excavations or as directed by the Director.
Any existing grassland shall be restored with four (4) inches of screened loam
that shall be fine graded, fertilized, seeded, rolled, and mulched.
         H.   Salt tolerant seed mixtures shall be used immediately adjacent to
the roadway; slope seed shall be used on all slopes; park seed mixture shall be
used in all other areas.
         I.   If the subsurface materials or pavement over or within the trench
influence area becomes depressed or broken at any time, the area shall be
immediately repaired. Repairs to the installation or backfill shall be made and
the pavement restored in the manner and within the time period specified by the
Director.
         J.   As the work progresses, all streets shall be thoroughly cleaned
of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris resulting from such work.
Dust control consisting of wetting, use of calcium chloride or other approved
methods shall be required to prevent a nuisance.
      (3)   Traffic Control.
         A.   The applicant is required to take all appropriate measures to
assure that during performance of the excavation work, so far as practicable,
normal traffic conditions including vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian traffic
shall be maintained at all times so as to cause as little inconvenience as
possible to the occupants of the adjoining property and to the general public.
         B.   Minimally, the applicant will be required, while street
excavation opening work is in progress, to utilize a certified flagger detail
to maintain traffic control and public safety at the project site.
      (4)   Emergency Provisions.
         A.   When a situation occurs that requires an emergency excavation,
the Police, Fire Department and Utility Companies shall be notified immediately
by telephone. At the earliest opportunity and no later than the first business
day after said emergency, the applicant shall obtain a regular permit at the
Office of Service-Safety Director.
         B.   The Director reserves the right to waive any of the provisions of
this regulation in the case of an emergency, and to impose such conditions as
they may require as part of an emergency permit. Partial or full street
closures under the emergency provision will require proper traffic controls as
per regular street excavation procedures.
      (5)   Winter Construction Procedures for Pavement Restoration.  Winter
construction procedures are in effect from November 15th through April 15th and
are intended to supplement the permitting conditions and construction
requirements specified herein. The procedures outlined in the  Street
Excavation Permit requirements shall be followed except for the placement of
hot bituminous pavement.
         A.   If hot bituminous pavement is available, three (3) inches of
temporary hot bituminous pavement (1/2" aggregate) shall be used.
         B.   When hot bituminous pavement is not available, cold patch may be

909.01  CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS GENERALLY.
   All sidewalks constructed on any public street within the City shall be
constructed according to the provisions of this chapter.  Such sidewalks shall
be constructed of cement or brick and shall be laid so that the top surface of
the walk shall at all points coincide with a line described as follows: 
beginning at the curb line of the street and with the established curb grade,
as determined by the City Engineer, thence extending to the street line at
right angles to the curb line with a rise of one-fourth inch to the foot for
cement walks and one-half inch to the foot for brick walks.  However, at street
intersections where the grade of the intersecting street prevents compliance
with the above provisions, the same shall be laid under the direction and to
the acceptance of the City Engineer.
   On all parts of streets having a grade of nine percent or under, the
sidewalks thereon shall be constructed of cement, and where the grade is more
than nine percent the sidewalks thereon shall be constructed of cement or
brick.
(1967 Code 909.01)
909.02  CEMENT SIDEWALKS.
   In the construction of cement sidewalks, the following specifications shall
be observed and complied with:
   (a)   Foundation.  The foundation of all cement sidewalks shall consist of a
layer of gravel or cinders of an approved quality eight inches thick which
shall be thoroughly rolled or tamped in place to an even, smooth surface and
shall extend three inches on each side of such walk.  Such thickness of eight
inches shall be the thickness of the foundation after it has been thoroughly
rolled or tamped.
   (b)   Kind of Cement.  All cement used must be Portland cement of known
brand, not slag, freshly burned and finely ground, of sufficient strength to
stand the required tests, and which shall meet the requirements of the standard
specifications for Portland cement, as adopted by the American Society for
Testing Materials.
   (c)   Sand.  All sand used shall be the best clean, hard, sharp sand, free
from dust, clay, loam, vegetable or other deleterious matter.
   (d)   Gravel or Limestone.  Gravel or limestone screenings must be small
enough to permit them to pass through a one-inch ring and shall be free from
dirt or other foreign substances.
   (e)   Concrete Base.  The concrete base shall be not less than four inches
thick and shall consist of one part cement, two parts sand and five parts
gravel or limestone screenings.  The cement, sand and gravel or limestone
screenings shall be thoroughly mixed dry; clean water shall then be added and
the whole mass shall be turned over not less than four times.  The concrete
shall be mixed in boxes prepared specially for the purpose, and each batch
shall be carefully put in place and rammed thoroughly until the mortar flushes
to the surface.
Before the concrete base is laid, the foundation shall be thoroughly sprinkled
or wet and shall be in such condition when the concrete base is laid, but no
concrete shall be allowed to be deposited in pools of water on the foundation.
   (f)   Wearing Surface and Finishing.  The top finish or wearing surface
shall not be less than one inch in thickness, shall be placed on top of the
concrete base as prepared above, and shall be applied within one hour after
completion of the bottom.  Such surface shall consist of one part cement and
two parts clean, sharp sand.  The sand and cement shall be thoroughly mixed dry
and then sufficient water added so that when tampered into mortar and well
tamped upon the base water will rise to the surface, after which it shall be
"struck off" with a straight edge and floated and troweled to a true finished
surface exactly to grade and slope.
   (g)   Roughened Surface.  The top or surface coat of all cement sidewalks
shall be finished with a properly roughened surface by using a wooden float or
other suitable means upon the same.
   (h)   How Laid.  The sidewalk shall be laid between guide strips securely
fastened to grade and line and laid in blocks or sections not more than six
feet nor less than four feet square, with a vertical joint between sections
extending through the entire thickness of the walk.  The joint shall be made by
a strip of paper or equivalent means.  The edges of such blocks at the joints
shall be finished and rounded to a radius of one-half inch with the proper type
of edging tool.
   (i)   Surface on Certain Grades.  Wherever cement sidewalks are laid on a
street having a grade of six percent or more, the wearing surface, after the
same has sufficiently set or hardened, shall be broomed over with a wire tooth
broom or brush to roughen the surface, and the marking shall be done in
straight lines across each slab or block in a workmanlike manner.
   (j)   Name of Contractor.  All sidewalks must bear at least one imprint or
name plate of the contractor doing the work.
   (k)   Protection.  As soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently to
prevent being pitted, the surface of the sidewalk shall be sprinkled with clean
water, and as soon thereafter as it can be done without damaging the concrete,
the surface of the walk shall be covered with not less than two inches of sand
or other material which will afford equally good protection.  Such covering
shall be kept wet for at least five days thereafter and closed to travel for at
least twelve days.
When deemed necessary or advisable, freshly laid concrete shall be protected by
a canvas covering.
   (l)   When not to be Mixed.  Concrete shall not be mixed or deposited when
the temperature is below freezing, nor in any case upon a frozen foundation.
If, at any time during the progress of the work, the temperature is or may drop
to forty degrees Fahrenheit, the water and other materials, as required, shall
be heated and precaution taken to protect the work from freezing  for at least
ten days.
   (m)   Contractor to Erect Barriers.  The contractor shall erect and maintain
suitable barricades and barriers to protect the concrete sidewalk from traffic
or travel, and before such sidewalk is open to travel the covering of sand or
other material shall be removed by the contractor at his expense.
   (n)   Machine-Mixed Concrete.  If any cement for a sidewalk is mixed by
machine, it shall be with the type of machine known as a "batch mixer", and no
make of continuous mixer shall be allowed on any work.  The mixing shall
continue until the cement is uniformly distributed and the concrete is uniform
in color and homogeneous.
   (o)   Removal of Refuse.  Upon completion of the above work and the opening
of the cement sidewalk to travel, all watercourses or gutters of streets shall
be left free from any excavated material, forms or other refuse incident to the
above work and in as good condition as before the work was done.
      (1967 Code 909.02)
909.03  BRICK SIDEWALKS.
   In the construction of brick sidewalks, the following specifications shall
be observed and complied with:
   (a)   Brick.  All bricks used in the work must be the best quality of
standard size, made of fire clay and made specially for street pavements.  They
must be thoroughly uniform, well-burned and of good, regular and uniform shape
and size, free from flaws and cracks, well vitrified and of strong and durable
texture and must not split or spawl by handling or usage nor when being rolled
or rammed.
   (b)   Foundation.  The foundation for all brick sidewalks shall consist of a
layer of gravel five inches thick spread on the bottom of the excavation and a
layer of clean, sharp sand two inches thick spread on top of the gravel.  These
thicknesses are to be that of the foundation of the pavement after it has been
completed by rolling, so that the foundation of the finished pavement shall
have such specified dimensions.
   (c)   Size of Gravel.  Gravel shall be of such size that the largest thereof
shall not have any dimensions greater than will permit it to pass through a
ring two inches in diameter.
   (d)   Preparation of Beds.  All beds on which pavements are to be laid must
be carefully prepared with a lute made for the special purpose, as the case may
be, and shall be kept prepared to the required grade and proper shape a
reasonable time in advance of the paving.
   (e)   Rolling or Ramming.  After the brick pavement has been laid, it shall
be rolled with hand roller or rammed with heavy hand rammers and planks until
the same is brought to the required grade and true alignment so as to show no
irregularities or uneven places in the surface of the pavement.
   (f)   Sand on Surface.  Immediately after the pavement has been rolled or
rammed it shall be covered to a depth of one-half inch with clean, fine, sharp
sand sufficient to thoroughly fill all joints and openings.  Such covering of
sand shall be thoroughly broomed until the same is accomplished.  The covering
of sand shall be left on the pavement for at least seven days when it shall be
removed by the contractor doing the work, at his expense.
   (g)   Removal of Material.  Upon completion of the above work and the
removal of the sand covering by the contractor, all watercourses or gutters of
streets shall be left free from any excavated materials, forms or other refuse
incident to the work and in as good condition as before the work was done.
      (1967 Code 909.03)
909.04  RAISING AND LOWERING SIDEWALKS; NEW SIDEWALKS.
   No sidewalk laid shall be raised or lowered without the approval of the City
Engineer, and all sidewalks to be laid shall be in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and under the supervision of the City Engineer.

Public Service-Safety, issue to such person so applying, a written permit which
shall set forth the width, grade and general specifications for the
construction of a sidewalk.  The applicant shall, upon completion of the
sidewalk, immediately return the permit to the City Engineer, who shall, after
inspection, accept or reject the work called for in the permit.
(1967 Code 909.06)
909.07  REMEDY BY CITY; COSTS.
   It shall be the duty of the Director of Public Service-Safety, upon being
notified that any sidewalk is being or has been constructed within the City not
in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, to immediately cause such
sidewalk to be removed, and the same re-laid to conform with this chapter.  The
expense of such re-laying shall be assessed against the premises abutting the
sidewalk and the cost and expense shall be certified to the proper officials to
be placed upon the tax duplicates for collection as provided by law, or payment
of the same may be enforced in any other manner provided by law.
(1967 Code 909.07)
909.08  RESPONSIBILITY OF ABUTTING OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS.
   No owner or occupant of property abutting upon the streets or alleys within
the City shall fail to keep such streets and alleys in front of his property

927.01  TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Sewer Use Chapter.
(Ord. 40, 1988.)
927.02  DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSE.
   The wastewater system of the City consists of sanitary sewers, pumping
stations, force mains and a wastewater treatment plant, the locations of which
are shown upon plans and drawings filed in the office of the Administrator of
the Water/Sewer Department, and all other appurtenances which are used in whole
or in part in connection with the collection, treatment and disposal of
wastewater;  and all other extensions, additions and improvements which may be
made to such system.  Its purpose is to provide for the collection and
treatment of domestic wastewater and such industrial wastewaters as are
permitted by this chapter and in coordination with Chapter
929, in order to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the
residents of the City.  The purpose of this chapter is to protect the
wastewater collection and treatment facilities by controlling the quantity,
quality and manner of discharge of wastewater into the wastewater system; and

and
      (2)   For service to an industrial user.
In either case, the owner or his agent shall make application on a special form
furnished by the City.  The permit application shall be supplemented by any
plans, specifications or other information considered pertinent in the judgment
of the Administrator.  County Sewer District users shall obtain permits from
the County.
   (c)   Permit Limitations.  Permits granted under this chapter shall be for a
specific wastewater, and such permits shall be granted only after approval of
plans as set forth herein.  Subsequent wastewaters of different quantity,
quality or characteristics shall be covered by separate permits.
   (d)   Permit Refusal.  The Administrator may refuse to issue a permit for a
new connection to the sanitary sewer system unless there is available capacity
in all downstream facilities, including treatment plant capacity for BOD5 and
suspended solids removal.  Capacity shall be determined on the basis of design
criteria previously approved or established by OEPA.
   (e)   Connection Charges.  In addition to the permit specified in subsection
(b) hereof, all new users (including the County Sewer District users)
connecting to the City wastewater system shall pay the connection charge as
called for in the City's Sewer Service Rate Ordinance.

that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the
building sewer.
   (g)   Building Sewer Limitations.  Every building which is the source of the
heretofore described acceptable wastewater shall be provided with a separate
and independent building sewer.  Where one building stands at the rear of
another or an interior lot, and no private sewer is available or can be
constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or
driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the
rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer.  In the case of
industry, several buildings may be served by one building sewer provided the
sewer is adequately sized, and provided it is approved by the Administrator.
   (h)   Old Building Sewers.  Old building sewers may be used in connection
with new buildings only when they are found on examination and test by the
Administrator or his representative to meet all requirements of this chapter.
   (i)   Combined Sewers.  The construction of or extensions to combined sewers
is hereby prohibited, unless approved by the OEPA.
   (j)   Private Sanitary Sewers.  "Private" (as opposed to "public") sanitary

such time as the owner and the City mutually agree to a transfer of ownership
to the City.  Such sewers shall be controlled by the City but shall be operated
and maintained by their owners, unless the City agrees in writing to provide
this service in which case a proper easement shall be dedicated to the City. 
Plans and specifications for private sanitary sewers shall be approved by the
Administrator prior to the start of construction.  Design and construction
shall be in accordance with the appropriate specifications of the American
Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) and the Water Pollution Control Federation
(WPCF) "Manual of Practice No. 9."
   (k)   Design and Construction of Building Sewers.  The minimum size and
slope, alignment and materials of construction of a building sewer, and the
methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and
backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the Building
and Plumbing Code or other applicable rules and regulations of the City, or its
designated representative, and approved by the Administrator.  In the absence
of Code provisions, or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures
set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society of Testing
Materials and Water Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. 9 shall
apply.  Specifically, building sewers shall be not less than six inches in
diameter, shall be constructed at a grade of not less than one-eighth of an
inch to the horizontal foot (preferably one-fourth inch per foot where
conditions permit a steeper slope), and shall be in accordance with the
following:
      (1)   Joints for vitrified clay bell and spigot pipe shall be compression
joints as defined by ASTM Designation: C-425.  Poured joints and joints of the
slip seal type shall not be approved.

accepted provided the revision upgrades the quality of the sewer construction.
      (6)   Sanitary sewer specifications shall include provisions for testing
the tightness of the sewer by an infiltration or exfiltration process or by any
other approved process.  The testing, as well as the sewer construction, shall
be under the direction of a qualified engineer or a competent inspector
directed by an engineer.
      (7)   Building sewers shall be constructed in accordance with
specifications equal to those indicated above.
      (8)   Sanitary sewer plans submitted for approval shall either be
accompanied by separate contract specifications or sewer specifications on the
plans.
   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an
elevation below the basement floor.  Basement floor drains and fixtures
installed in basements at the owner's risk of damage may be discharged into the
sanitary sewer when properly trapped against back pressure.  In all buildings
in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public
sewer, wastewater carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved
means and discharged to the building sewer.
   (l)   Illegal Connections.  No person shall make connections of roof
downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, driveway drains or
other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building
drain which, in turn, is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary
sewer.
   (m)   Building Sewer.  The connection of the building sewer into the public
sanitary sewer shall conform to the same requirements as specified in

the Administrator when the building sewer is ready for inspection and
connection to the public sanitary sewer.  The connection shall be made under
the supervision of the Administrator or his authorized representative.  The
connection to the public sanitary sewer and the connection between the building
drain and the building sewer, as well as the full length of the building sewer,
shall remain uncovered until approved by the Administrator or his
representative.
   (o)   Safety and Restoration.  All excavations for building sewer
installations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to
protect the public from hazard.  Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public
property disturbed in the course of construction shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the City and in accordance with City standards.

unpolluted industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer.  Any such
connections shall be subject to immediate removal by the owner of the premises
so connected and at the owner's expense.  Subfoundation building drains
connected to sanitary sewers before the effective date of this section shall
not be required to be removed unless it is established by the Administrator
that such connection is detrimental to the satisfactory operation of the sewage
works and that such removal is cost-effective in accordance with guidelines
established by U.S. EPA.  Any such connections made after the effective date of
this section shall be prohibited and shall be removed.
   Should the owner of such an illegally connected premises fail to remove the
connection within ninety days after the date of official notice to do so, the

such halflife or concentration as exceed limits established by the Authority in
compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
      (14)   Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance.
      (15)   Any removal of manhole lids or other access to the sewer system
for the purpose of discharging wastes at times and/or locations other than
those designated by the Director, or without the expressed permission of the
Director, shall be considered a violation and shall be subject to enforcement
action including fines and penalties allowed under this chapter.
      (16)   Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil or products of mineral
oil origin if discharged in quantities or concentrations which can pass through
or cause interference.
   Whoever violates this section shall be punished by fine not exceeding one
thousand dollars ($1,000) and costs, and if default is made in payment thereof,
such person may be confined in the City Jail for a period not exceeding 120
days.  Each day of violation shall be a separate offense.
   (b)   Limitations on Wastewater Strength.
      (1)   National Categorical Pretreatment Standards.  National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards as promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) pursuant to the Act shall be met by all dischargers of the
regulated industrial categories.  An application for modification of the
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be considered for submittal to
the Regional Administrator by the Authority, when the Authority's wastewater
treatment system achieves consistent removal of the pollutants as defined by 40
CFR 403.7.
      (2)   State requirements.  State requirements and limitations on
discharges to the POTW shall be met by all dischargers which are subject to
such standards in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal
requirements and limitations or those in this or any other applicable
ordinance.
      (3)   Right of revision.  The Authority reserves the right to amend this
chapter to provide for more stringent limitations or other requirements on
discharges to the POTW where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set
forth in subsection (a) hereof.
   The Authority also reserves the right to enter into a separate agreement
with a discharger to establish specific discharge limitations.  Surcharges may
be imposed in those cases where unusual or extra-strength wastes are accepted
by the POTW.  In any case, the objectives set forth in subsection (a) hereof
shall apply, and these objectives shall govern the acceptance of any
wastewater.  In no case shall the acceptance of an unusual or extra- strength
waste be allowed which will violate state and federal pretreatment standards,
cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit and water quality standards, nor
shall it impose any harm to the general public, the sewer system or POTW.
      (4)   Dilution.  No discharger shall increase the use of potable or
process water in any way, nor mix separate waste streams for the purpose of
diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment
to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this chapter.
         (Ord. 66, 1991.  Passed 10-21-91.)
      (5)   Supplementary limitations.  No discharger shall discharge
wastewater containing concentrations of the following enumerated materials
exceeding the following values:
 
            Material         Concentration (mg/l)
      Arsenic      0.57
      Cadmium   0.097
      Copper      0.121
      Total cyanide   0.331
      Lead      2.194
      Mercury   0.001

                          Selenium                                       3.947
   The Authority may impose mass limitations on discharges which are using
dilution to meet the pretreatment standards or requirements of this chapter or
in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is deemed appropriate
by the Authority.
(Ord. 2, 2017.  Passed 1-3-17.)
   (c)   Accidental Discharges.  Each discharger shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or substances
established by this chapter.  Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental
discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the
discharger's cost and expense.  Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Authority for
review, and shall be approved by the Authority before construction of the
facility.  Each existing discharger shall complete its plan and submit same to
the Authority.  No discharger who discharges to the POTW after the aforesaid
date shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until
accidental discharge protection procedures have been approved by the
Authority.  Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the
Authority shall not relieve the discharger from the responsibility to modify
its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   Dischargers shall notify the Authority immediately upon the occurrence of a
slugload or accidental discharge of substances prohibited by this chapter.  The
notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type
of waste, concentration and volume and corrective actions.  Any discharger who
discharges a slugload of prohibited materials shall be liable for any expense,
loss or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on
the Authority on account thereof under state or federal law.
   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the discharger's
premises, advising employees whom to call in the event of a slug or accidental
discharge.  Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover
such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedure.
(Ord. 66, 1991.  Passed 10-21-91.)
929.04  FEES.
   (a)   Purpose.  It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for the payment
of fees from dischargers to the Authority's wastewater disposal system, to
compensate the Authority for the cost of administration of the pretreatment
program established herein, and other fees as presented below.
   (b)   Charges and Fees (Reserved).  The City shall adopt charges and fees

by the discharger and may require additional information.  Within thirty days
after full evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, the Authority shall
notify the discharger of the Authority's acceptance thereof.
      (3)   Standards modification.  The Authority reserves the right to amend
this chapter and the terms and conditions hereof in order to assure compliance
by the Authority with applicable laws and regulations.  Where a discharger,
subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, has not previously
submitted a disclosure form as required by subsection (b)(2) hereof, the
discharger shall file a disclosure form with the Authority within 180 days
after the promulgation of the applicable National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard by the U.S. EPA.  In addition, any discharger operating on the basis
of a previous filing of a disclosure statement shall submit to the Authority
within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard the additional information required by subsection (b)
(2)H. and I. hereof.  The discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes
in the chapter at least thirty days prior to the effective date of change.  Any
changes or new conditions in the chapter shall include a reasonable time
schedule for compliance.
   (c)   Reporting Requirements for SIUs and Categorical Dischargers.
      (1)   Compliance data report.  Within ninety days following the specific
date of final compliance by the discharger with applicable pretreatment
standards set forth in this chapter or ninety days following commencement of
the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any
discharger subject to this chapter shall submit to the Authority a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated
substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow
in gallons.  The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional O and M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the discharger
into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. 
This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the
discharger.
      (2)   Periodic compliance reports for SIUs and categorical dischargers.
         A.   Any discharger subject to a pretreatment standard set forth in
this chapter, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in
the case of a new discharger, after commencement of the discharge to the
Authority, shall submit to the Authority during the months of June and
December, unless required more frequently by the Authority, a report indicating
the nature and concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the
effluent which are limited by the pretreatment standards hereof.  In addition,
this report shall include a record of all measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows during the reporting period reported in subsection (c)(1)
hereof.  Flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement provided,
however, where cost or feasibility considerations justify, the Authority may
accept reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable
techniques.  The Authority for good cause shown considering such factors as
local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles or other extenuating
factors, may authorize the submission of such reports on months other than
those specified above.
         B.   Reports of dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass where required by the Authority.  The frequency of
monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed by the Authority.  All
analysis shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments
thereto.  (Comment:  Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include a sampling or
analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall
be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA
publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with
any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator of
the U.S. EPA.)
         C.   All industrial users shall promptly notify the Director in
advance of any substantial changes in the volume or character of pollutants in
their discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for
which the industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR
403.12(p).
         D.   All SIUs are required to submit periodic self-monitoring reports
at least once every six months.  This monitoring may be conducted by the POTW
instead of the SIU.
      POTWs shall evaluate SIUs every two years to determine whether they need
a plan to control slug discharges.  If the POTW determines that such a plan is
needed, the plan shall contain certain minimum elements specified in the
regulation.
      (3)   Signatory requirements.  All reports required under this section
shall include the certification statement as set forth in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)
(ii) and shall be signed by:
         A.   A president, secretary, treasurer or vice president of a
corporation; or,
         B.   A general partner or proprietor if the industrial user is a
partnership or sole proprietorship respectively; or,
         C.   A duly authorized representative of the above if the
authorization is previously made in writing to the Superintendent.
      (4)   Hazardous waste notification requirements.  Industrial users are
required to notify their POTW, the Ohio EPA, and U.S. EPA Regions V by February
23, 1991, if they are disposing of any RCRA listed or characteristic hazardous
waste, as defined in 40 CFR 261, by discharging it into the POTW.  Exempt from
this notification requirement are those IUs who discharge fifteen kilograms or
less per month of non-acute hazardous waste.  The IU is also required to
certify that they are implementing a program to reduce the amount of hazardous
waste generated.

   (d)   Monitoring Facilities.  Each discharger shall provide and operate at
the discharger's own expense, a monitoring facility to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of each sewer discharge to the Authority.  Each
monitoring facility shall be situated on the discharger's premises, except
where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
discharger.  The Authority may concur with the facility being constructed in
the public street or sidewalk area provided that the facility is located so
that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.  The facility,
sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger.
   All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance
with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. 
Construction shall be completed within 120 days of receipt of the permit by
discharger.
   (e)   Inspection and Sampling.  The Authority shall inspect the monitoring
facilities and records of dischargers to determine compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.  The discharger shall allow the Authority or its
representatives, upon presentations of credentials of identification, to enter
upon the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling or records
examination or records copying.  The Authority shall have the right to set up
on the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
   (f)   Confidential Information.  Information and data furnished to the
Authority with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be
available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless
the discharger specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Authority that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets or proprietary information of the discharger.
   When requested by a discharger furnishing a report, the portions of a report
which may disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, state disposal
system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such
portions of a report shall be available for use by the State or any state
agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the discharger
furnishing the report.  Wastewater constituents and characteristics shall not
be recognized as confidential information.  Information accepted by the
Authority as confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency
or to the general public by the Authority until and unless a ten-day
notification is given to the Discharger.
(Ord. 66. 1991.  Passed 10-21-91.)
929.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   The Superintendent acting for the City may issue orders to any industrial
user to require compliance with any requirements under this chapter, including
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, other discharge limits and
report requirements.
   (a)   Emergency Suspension of Service and Discharge Permits.  The Authority
may for good cause shown suspend the wastewater treatment service to a
discharger when it appears to the Authority that an actual or threatened
discharge presents or threatens an imminent or substantial danger to the health
or welfare of persons, substantial danger to the environment, interfere with
the operation of the POTW or violate any pretreatment limits imposed by this
chapter.  The Authority provides the POTW to immediately and effectively halt
or prevent any
discharge of pollutants to the POTW which reasonably appear to present an
imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.  Any discharger
notified of the suspension of the Authority's wastewater treatment service
shall within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the Authority, cease
all discharges.  In the event of failure of the discharger to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified time, the Authority
shall commence judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the
discharger's compliance with such order.
   (b)   Revocation of Treatment Services.  The Authority may seek to terminate
the wastewater treatment services to any discharger which fails to:
      (1)   Factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of
its discharge;
      (2)   Report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics;
      (3)   Refuses reasonable access to the discharger's premises by
representative of the Authority for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
      (4)   Violates the conditions of this chapter, or any final judicial
order entered with respect thereto.
   (c)   Notification of Violation; Administrative Adjustment.  Whenever the
Authority finds that any discharger has engaged in conduct which justifies
termination of wastewater treatment services, pursuant to subsection (b)
hereof, the Authority shall serve or cause to be served upon such discharger, a
written notice either personally or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation.  Within thirty
days of the date of the receipt of the notice, the discharger shall respond
personally or in writing to the Authority, advising of its position with
respect to the allegations.  Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain
the veracity of the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan for the
satisfactory correction thereof.
   (d)   Show Cause Hearing.  Where the violation of subsection (b) hereof is
not corrected by timely compliance by means of administrative adjustment, the
Authority may order any discharger which causes or allows conduct prohibited by
subsection (b) hereof, to show cause before the Authority or its duly
authorized representative why the proposed service termination action should
not be taken.  A written notice shall be served on the discharger by personal
service, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, specifying the
time and place of a hearing to be held by the Authority or its designee
regarding the violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken,
the proposed enforcement action and directing the discharger to show cause
before the Authority or its designee why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken.  The notice of the hearing shall be served no less than ten days
before the hearing.  Service may be made on any agent, officer or authorized
representative of a discharger.  The proceedings at the hearing shall be
considered by the Authority which shall then enter appropriate orders with
respect to the alleged improper activities of the discharger.  Appeal of such
orders may be taken by the discharger in accordance with applicable local or
state law.
   (e)   Judicial Proceedings.  Following the entry of any order by the
Authority with respect to the conduct of a discharger contrary to the
provisions of subsection (b) hereof, the attorney for the Authority may,
following the authorization of such action by the Authority, commence an action
for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate local court.
   (f)   Enforcement Actions; Annual Publication.  At least annually, the
Director shall publish a list of all industrial users which at any time during
the previous twelve months were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment requirements.  For the purposes of this provision, an industrial
user is in significant noncompliance if its violations meet one or more of the
following criteria:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all of the measurements taken
during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or
the average limit for the same pollutant parameter;
      (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of all of the measurements for each
pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product
of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable
TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH);
      (3)   Any other violations of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily
maximum or longer term average) that the Director determines has caused, alone
or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through
(including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);
      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
of human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)   Failure to meet, within ninety days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or
attaining final compliance;
      (6)   Failure to provide, within thirty days after the due date, required
reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety-days compliance reports,
periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
      (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance;
      (8)   Any other violation or group of violations which the Director
determines will or has adversely affected the operation or implementation of
the City's pretreatment program.
   (g)   Right of Appeal.  Any discharger or any interested party shall have
the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the Authority on
any matter covered by this chapter and shall be entitled to a prompt written
reply.  In the event that such inquiry is by a discharger and deals with
matters of performance or compliance with this chapter for which enforcement
activity relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a
discharger's request, shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of
the aforesaid written reply.  Appeal of any final judicial order entered
pursuant to this chapter may be taken in accordance with local and state law.
   (h)   Operating Upsets.  Any discharger which experiences an upset in
operations which places the discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance
with this chapter shall inform the Authority thereof within twenty-four hours
of first awareness of the commencement of the upset.  Where such information is
given orally, a written follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the
discharger with the Authority within five days.  The report shall specify:
      (1)   The description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset's
impact on a discharger's compliance status.
      (2)   The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur.
      (3)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
A documented and verified bona fide operating upset shall be an affirmative
defense to any enforcement action brought by the Authority against a discharger
for any noncompliance with the chapter, which arises out of violations alleged
to have occurred during the period of the upset.
      (Ord. 66, 1991.  Passed 10-21-91.)
929.07  RECORDS RETENTION.
   All dischargers subject to this chapter shall retain and preserve for no
less than three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports,
correspondence and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring,
sampling and chemical analyses made by or in behalf of a discharger in
connection with its discharge.  All records which pertain to matters which are
the subject of administrative adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation
activities brought by the Authority pursuant hereto, shall be retained and
preserved by the discharger until all enforcement activities have concluded and
all periods of limitation with respect to any and all appeals have expired.
(Ord. 66, 1991.  Passed 10-21-91.)
929.08  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Removal Credits.  Where applicable, the Authority may elect to
initiate a program of removal credits as part of this chapter to reflect the
POTW's ability to remove pollutants in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.7.
   (b)   Net/Gross Calculations.  The Authority may elect to adjust categorical
pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in the dischargers
intake water, in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.15.
(Ord. 66, 1991.  Passed 10-21-91.)
929.09  CONFLICT.
   All other ordinances and parts of other ordinances inconsistent or
conflicting with any part of this chapter, are hereby repealed to the extent of
such inconsistency or conflict.
(Ord. 66, 1991.  Passed 10-21-91.)
929.99  PENALTY.
   (a)   Civil Penalties.  Any discharger who is found to have violated any
provision of this chapter, their wastewater discharge permit or any order of
the City or court of competent jurisdiction shall be subject to the imposition
of a civil penalty of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation.  Each
day on which a violation occurs or continues shall be deemed a separate and
distinct violation.  In addition to the penalties provided herein, the City may
recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, court reporter's fees and
other expenses of litigation by appropriate suit at law against the discharger.
   (b)   Recovery of Costs Incurred by the Authority.  Any discharger violating
any of the provisions of this chapter, or who discharges or causes a discharge
producing a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the
Authority's wastewater disposal system, shall be liable to the Authority for
any expense, loss or damage caused by such violation or discharge.  The

931.04  DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   The service charges shall consist of a user charge, a debt service
charge, extra strength user surcharge and connection charge.  The user charge
is payment to the City by all recipients of sewer service for treatment of
normal strength wastewater or wastewater of less than normal strength.  It is
designed to offset the cost of operation and maintenance of the collection and
treatment facilities, including cost associated with equipment replacement. 
The user charge is intended to enable the Sewer Department to be financially
self-sufficient with respect to operation and maintenance of its facilities.
   (b)   For wastewaters which exceed normal strength, the user shall pay extra
strength user surcharges, as specified herein under Section
931.07 in addition to the other sewer service charges specified in this chapter
for normal strength wastewater.
   (c)   The debt service charge is payment to the City by all recipients of
service, and is designed to cover specific debt service requirements incurred
as a result of constructing required capital improvements.
   (d)   The connection charge is a one-time charge that shall be paid by all
new users that will be tributary to the City's wastewater system.  It is a
charge for acquiring equity in the City's existing wastewater system.  Funds
received from these charges shall be used for future capital improvements of
the City's wastewater treatment plant.
(Ord. 39.  Passed 8-1-88.)
931.05  CLASSES OF USERS.
   The various classes of users of the sanitary sewerage system shall be as
follows:
      Residential
      Commercial
      Governmental/Institutional
      Industrial
      County Sewer District user.
   The various classes of users are defined in Section
931.03.
(Ord. 39.  Passed 8-1-88.)
931.06  USER CHARGES AND DEBT SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)   The following user charges and debt service charges shall be paid by
all classes of users (as identified in Section
931.05 of the Codified Ordinances) throughout the service area and the charges
shall be based on each 1,000 gallons of flow being discharged to the sanitary
system.
   User Class            Dollars Per 1,000 Gallons
   All classes, except County      Effective September 1, 2016 - 6.25 per 1,000
gallons
   Sewer District users         Effective September 1, 2017-6.84 per 1,000
gallons
                  Effective September 1, 2018-7.52 per 1,000 gallons
   County Sewer District users      Per Ordinance 29, 2002
(Ord. 65, 2016.  Passed 9-19-16.)
   The rate differential for the County Sewer District user charge reflects the
costs associated with the City's operation, maintenance and replacement (O, M
and R) costs of the wastewater collection system and the sewer billing costs.
   (b)   A minimum monthly charge based on 2,000 gallons per months per user is
hereby established in order to generate sufficient revenue to recover fixed
costs associated with the wastewater treatment works.
   (c)   Each industry discharging to the sanitary sewer system shall comply
with Section
929.05 regarding pertinent information as to quantity of flow, characteristics
of discharged wastewaters, etc., and this information shall be used to
determine billings for the first year following the effective date of this
section.  Subsequent billings shall be based on revised information taken from
updated reports to be filed with the Sewer Department.
   (d)   Where industrial wastewater is combined with sanitary wastewater at
the point or points of discharge, and no separate metering of each increment is
provided, the sanitary wastewater from industry shall be considered equal to
fifteen gallons per day per employee (thirty gallons per day where showers are
used) at normal strength loadings as previously defined herein.
   (e)   The service charges, other than minimum charges, shall be computed on
the basis of the water purchased from the City, as registered by the water
meter or meters, unless the actual quantity of wastewater entering the sanitary
sewer system can be determined, as specified hereinafter.
   (f)   Each premises served by the sanitary sewer system of the City shall be
charged, and where a premises is served by more than one sewer connection, a
combined charge shall be levied based on the total flow from all connections.
   (g)   Where more than one meter is installed, whether for the convenience of
the owner of the premises or the City, sewer service charges shall be rendered
to the owner of the premises for each meter, unless the combined flow through
all meters is authorized by the Superintendent.
   (h)   When a person, firm or corporation can show to the satisfaction of the
Board of Public Utilities that a portion of the water as measured by the water
meter(s) does not enter the sanitary sewer system, such as uncontaminated
cooling water, such person, firm or corporation may submit an application in
writing to the Board of Public Utilities for the installation of an auxiliary
water meter. The Board has the authority to permit or to require an additional
meter(s) to be installed at the applicant's expense, so as to measure the
quantity of water actually entering the sanitary sewer system.  The quantity of
water used to determine the service charges shall be the quantity of water
entering the sanitary sewer system as so determined.
   (i)   If the Administrator finds that it is not practicable to measure such
water by meters, he shall determine the volume of wastewater in any manner or
method as he may find practicable, in order to arrive at the percentage of
metered water entering the sanitary sewer system and the quantity of water used
to determine the sewer service charges shall be that percentage so determined.
   (j)   In the event that the conditions set forth in subsection (h) hereof
are not, for any reason, met, all water metered to the premises shall be used
for billing purposes.
   (k)   When a premises is supplied either whole or in part with water from
wells or any source other than a public water supply, such wells or source of
supply shall be registered in writing with the Board of Public Utilities.  The
owner of the premises shall install and maintain at his expense, a meter or
meters acceptable to the Department, on all such supplies, and the quantity of
water used to determine the service charges shall be the quantity as measured
by the meter or meters.  If the meter or meters are not installed within six
months from the date of notification in writing by the Board of Public
Utilities, the owner or other users of the premises shall be billed double the
minimum charge.
   (l)   Where an auxiliary meter (or meters) is required for the proper
determination of water subject to the service charges, such meter shall be
installed only after approval has been granted by the Administrator.  Such
meters shall be installed, owned and maintained by the property owner.  Venturi
meters, flumes, weirs and other methods of measuring flows shall be used only
when authorized by the Administrator.
   It is understood that where an auxiliary meter has been installed, such a
meter shall not be removed without the approval of the Administrator.
   (m)   All meters shall be installed in accordance with the standards and
rules and regulations of the City Water Department.
   Where private meters are used on wells, or in an industrial water
distribution system, and such meters are set behind the primary water supply
meter, the aforementioned standards, rules and regulations may be modified or
waived by the Board of Public Utilities.
   (n)   Fire protection service branches shall be exempt from all service
charges except for water used for purposes other than fire protection.
   (o)   Where a sanitary sewer in the area served by the City is available to
any lot, parcel of land, building or premises which is improved, it is a
conclusive presumption that wastewater from such lot, parcel of land, building
or premises which is improved is discharged into such sewer, and the owner
shall be billed the service charges as provided herein.  Any lot, parcel of
land, building or premises abutting a street, alley or easement in which there
is a public sanitary sewer shall be deemed to have available access to a
sanitary sewer, and the owner or other users of the real property shall connect
to such sewer within six months from the date the owner is notified in writing
by the Board of Public Utilities that the sewer is made available for use to
their property.  In the event the owner or other users of the real property are
not connected on such date, the charges specified under subsections (a) and (b)
hereof shall be imposed upon such property.  Revenue from these charges shall
be deposited in the Wastewater Treatment Plant Improvement Fund.  Exceptions
shall be as specified under Section
927.04(d).
(Ord. 39.  Passed 8-1-88.)
931.07  EXTRA STRENGTH USER SURCHARGES.
   (a)   Surcharges shall be determined on the basis of the following
constituents of the wastewater that are in excess of normal strength
wastewater:
      (1)   Total suspended solids (non-filterable residue)
      (2)   BOD, 5-days at twenty degrees Centigrade.
   (b)   When any or all of the total suspended solids or BOD5 of a wastewater
accepted for admission to the City's sanitary sewer system exceeds the values
of the above specified constituents or normal strength wastewater, the amount
of the treatment surcharge to be paid shall be based on the cost per pound of
removing the excess quantity of each constituent.
   (c)   Extra strength user surcharges are hereby established as follows:
               Cost Per Pound
      (1)   Suspended solids      $0.26
      (2)   5-day biochemical oxygen demand   0.26
(Ord. 39.  Passed 8-1-88.)
931.08  PERMIT, INSPECTION AND CONNECTION CHARGES.
   (a)   The various charges specified in this section relate to all new users
connecting to the City's wastewater system that are inside the City, outside
the City (not part of the County Sewer District), or part of the Columbiana
County Water and Sewer District No. 2.
   (b)   A permit and inspection fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) for a

and of such duration and in such manner as the Board of Public Utilities may
elect, determine the strength of the discharged wastewater for purposes of
verification.  If the owner fails to file the necessary reports, the strength
determined by the Sewer Department's analysis shall be used to determine the
amount of surcharges.  Similarly, the surcharges shall be applied to the total
metered water consumption if the owner fails to file the required reports.

on the map aforesaid.
      (3)   Permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has
been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God or the public enemy to the extent
of more than sixty percent of its fair market value where the Board finds some
compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use and the
primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to continue a
monopoly.
      (4)   Waive or reduce the parking and loading requirements in any of the
district whenever the character or use of the building is such as to make
unnecessary the full provision of parking or loading facilities, or where such
regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship on the use of the lot, as
contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a convenience.
      (5)   Permit land within 300 feet of a multiple dwelling to be improved
for the parking spaces required in connection with a multiple dwelling, but
only when there is positive assurance that such land will be used for such
purpose during the existence of the multiple dwelling.
      (6)   Determine whether an industry should be permitted within the "M-1"
or "M-2" Industrial District because of the methods by which it would be
operated and because of its effect upon uses within surrounding zoning
districts.
      (7)   The substitution of a nonconforming use existing at the time of
enactment of this Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance 14, 1967, passed May 22, 1967),
for another nonconforming use, if no structural alterations except those
required by law or ordinance are made, provided, however, that in an "R" or "B"
District, no change shall be authorized by the Board to any use which is not a
permitted use or special exception in any "R" or "B" District.
      (8)   Nonconforming mobile home parks can be expanded by increasing the
number of trailers by not more than twenty percent over their number at the
date of the passage of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that such expansion
meets the minimum requirements of Section
1129.02 .
      (9)   Temporary Structures and Uses.  The temporary use of a structure or
premises in any district for a purpose or use that does not conform to the
regulations prescribed elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance for the district in
which it is located, provided that such use be of a temporary nature and does
not involve the erection of a substantial structure.  A zoning certificate for
such use shall be granted in the form of a temporary and revocable permit, for
not more than a twelve month period, subject to such conditions as will
safeguard the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare.
1107.06  VARIANCES.
   (a)   The Board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals or variances
and authorize such variances from the provisions or requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest.  In authorizing a
variance, the Board may attach conditions and require such guarantee or bond as
it may deem necessary to assure compliance with the objectives of this Zoning
Ordinance.  On appeal, where there is unnecessary hardship, the Board may grant
a variance in the application of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance only
if all of the following findings are made:
      (1)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions generally created by the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which
the property is located.
      (2)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      (3)   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
      (4)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be determental to the public welfare.
      (5)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
   (b)   The Board shall have the authority to grant an extension or permit
completion of a building devoted to a nonconforming use upon a lot occupied by
such building, or on a lot adjoining, provided that such lot was under the same
ownership as the lot in question on the date such building became nonconforming
and where such extension is necessary and incidental to the existing use of
such building; provided, however, that the floor areas of such extension shall
not exceed in all one hundred percent (100%) of the floor area of the existing
building or buildings devoted to a nonconforming use.
1107.07  SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Under the authorization granted in Ohio R.C. Chapter 713, to hear and
decide special exceptions to the terms of this Zoning Ordinance, the Board
shall have the power to decide applications for special exceptions in those
cases specified in Chapter
1123 of this Zoning Ordinance.  In considering such application, the Board
shall give due regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and
structures; and may impose such requirements and conditions as the Board may
deem necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public
interest, including specific limitations as to future expansion.
   (b)   The following basic standards shall apply to special exceptions in any
"S", "A" or "R" District:
      (1)   The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations involved in or conducted in connection with it, its site layout and
its relation to streets giving access to it shall be such that both pedestrian
and vehicular traffic to and from the use and the assembly of persons in
connection with it will not be hazardous, inconvenient or conflict with the
normal traffic on residential streets, both at the time and as the same may be
expected to increase with any prospective increase in the population of the
area, taking into account convenient routes of pedestrian traffic particularly
of children, relation to main traffic thoroughfares and to street
intersections, and the general character and intensity of development of the
area.
      (2)   The location and height of buildings, the location, nature and
height of walls and fences, and the nature and extent of landscaping on the
site shall be such that the use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate
development and use of adjacent land and buildings.
   (c)   The following basic standards shall apply to special exceptions in any
"B" or "M" District:
      (1)   The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations involved in or conducted in connection with it, its site layout and
its relation to streets giving access to it shall be such that vehicular
traffic to and from the use will not be more hazardous than the normal traffic
of the district, both at the time and as the same may be expected to increase
with increasing development of the Municipality, taking into account vehicular
turning movements in relation to routes of traffic flow, relation to street
intersections, sight distances, and relations to pedestrian traffic.
1107.08  PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   The Board shall have the power to authorize issuance of a zoning
certificate for uses that are subject to performance requirements as set forth
in this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   The application for a zoning certificate for a use subject to
performance requirements shall be accompanied by a plan of the proposed
construction or development, a description of the proposed machinery, processes
and products and specifications for the mechanisms and techniques to be used in
meeting the performance requirements.
   (c)   The Board may refer to the application to one or more expert
consultants qualified to advise as to whether a proposed use will conform to
the performance requirements.  The costs of such services shall be borne by the
applicant, and a copy of any reports shall be furnished the applicant.
1107.09  INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT MAP.
   Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as recorded,
differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the Zoning District Map, the
Board, after notice to the owners of the property and after public hearing,
shall interpret the Map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of
this Zoning Ordinance.  In case of any questions as to the location of any
boundary line between zoning districts, a request for interpretation of the
Zoning District Map may be made to the Board and a determination shall be made
by such Board.

1109.01  COUNCIL'S AUTHORITY; COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS.
   Whenever the public necessity, convenience, general welfare or good zoning
practices require, Council may by ordinance, after receipt of recommendation
thereon from the Planning Commission, and subject to the procedures provided by
law, amend, supplement or change the regulations, district boundaries or
classification of property, now or hereafter established by this Zoning
Ordinance or amendments thereof.  It shall be the duty of the Commission to
submit to Council its recommendations regarding all applications or proposals
for amendments or supplements.
1109.02  PROCEDURE FOR DISTRICT CHANGE.
   (a)   Applications.  Applications for any change of district boundaries or
classifications of property as shown on the Zoning Map shall be submitted to
the Commission, at its public office, upon such forms and shall be accompanied
by such data and information as may be prescribed for that purpose by the
Commission, so as to assure the fullest practicable presentation of facts for
the permanent record.  Each such application shall be verified by at least one
of the owners or lessees of property within the area proposed to be
reclassified, attesting to the truth and correctness of all facts and
information presented with the applications.  Applications for amendments
initiated by the Commission shall be accompanied by its motion pertaining to
such proposed amendment.
   (b)   Names and Addresses of Adjacent Property Owners.  Any person or
persons desiring a change in the zoning classification of property shall file
with the application for such change, a statement giving the names and
addresses of the owners of all properties lying within 200 feet of any part of
the property the zoning classification of which is proposed to be changed.
   (c)   Public Hearing by Commission.  Before submitting its recommendation on
a proposed amendment to Council, the Commission shall hold a public hearing
thereon, notice of which shall be given by publication in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City at least thirty days before the date of the
hearing.  The notice shall state the place or places and times at which the
proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance, including text and maps, may be
examined.
   (d)   Notice to Property Owners.  In addition to the published notice as
hereinbefore specified, the Commission shall give notice of the time, place and
purpose of public hearings to be held by it on proposed amendments or
supplements, by mailing a postal card or letter notice not less than twenty
days prior to the date of the hearing, to the owners of all properties lying
within 200 feet of any part of the property proposed to be changed.  The
failure to notify, as provided in this section, shall not invalidate any
recommendations adopted hereunder; it being the intention of this section to
provide, so far as may be possible, due notice to the persons substantially
interested in the proposed change that an application is pending before the
Commission, proposing to make a change in the Zoning District Map or the
regulations set forth in this Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)   Action of Commission.  The Commission may recommend that the
application be granted as requested, or it may recommend a modification of the
zoning amendment requested in the application, or it may recommend that the
application be not granted.  These recommendations shall then be certified to
Council within thirty days after the hearing.
   (f)   Public Hearing by Council.  After receiving from the Commission the
certification of such recommendations on the proposed amendment, and before
adoption of such amendment, Council shall hold a public hearing thereon, at
least thirty days' notice of the time and place of which shall be given by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City once a week for
two weeks.  The notice shall state the place or places and times at which the
proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance, including text and maps, may be
examined and other notices as required by State statutes or the Planning
Commission.
   (g)   Notice to Property Owners.  In addition to the published notice as
hereinbefore specified, the Clerk of Council shall give notice of the time,
place and purpose of public hearings to be held by it on proposed amendments or
supplements, by mailing a first-class mail notice not less than twenty days
prior to the date of hearing to the owners of all properties lying within 200
feet of any part of the property proposed to be changed.  The failure to notify
as provided in this section shall not invalidate any recommendation adopted
hereunder; it being the intention of this section to provide notice to the
persons substantially interested in the proposed change that an application is
pending before the Commission proposing to make a change in the Zoning District
Map or the regulations set forth in this Zoning Ordinance.
   (h)   Action of Council.  After receiving from the Planning Commission
certification of the recommendations on the proposed amendment and after
holding the above public hearing, Council shall consider such recommendations
and vote on the passage of the proposed amendment to the text of the Zoning
Ordinance or the Zoning District Map.  No such ordinance, measure or regulation
which differs from or departs from the plan or report submitted by the
Commission shall take effect unless passed or approved by not less than three-
fourths of the membership of the legislative authority.
1109.03  APPLICATION FEES.
   (a)   (1)   At the time that an application for a change of zoning districts
is filed with the Commission, as provided herein, there shall be deposited with

agricultural supplies, grain, building materials, oil and gas well equipment
storage and sales, plus sand and gravel extraction.
   (c)   "M-3" General Industrial.  Areas which because of their access to
transportation and community services; and relative isolation from other urban
uses provide good sites for most types of heavier industries.
1121.06  ZONING DISTRICT MAP.
   The boundaries of the districts are shown on the Map which is attached to,
incorporated by reference and made part of this Zoning Ordinance, which Map is
designated as the "Zoning District Map."  Such Map and all of the notations,
references and other information shown thereon are a part of this Zoning
Ordinance and have the same force and effect as if such Map and all the
notations, references and other information shown thereon were all fully set
forth or described herein; the original of such Map is properly attested and is
on file with the Service Director.
   No changes of any nature shall be made in the Zoning District Map or matter
shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this Zoning
Ordinance.
   In the event that the Zoning District Map becomes damaged, destroyed or
lost, Council may by ordinance adopt a new Zoning District Map which shall
supersede the prior Zoning District Map. 
1121.07  DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The district boundary lines on such Map are intended to follow either center
lines of streets or alleys or lot lines, and, where the districts designated on
the Map are bounded approximately by such street, alley or lot lines, the
street, alley or lot line shall be construed to be the boundary of the
district, unless such boundary is otherwise indicated on the Map.  In the case
of unsubdivided property, the district boundary line shall be determined by the
use of the scale appearing on the Zoning District Map or by dimensions.

residential district for a period of more than two weeks shall be prohibited,
except that such vehicles may be stored in an enclosed garage or other
accessory building, provided that no business shall be conducted in connection
therewith while such vehicle is parked or stored.

      (1)   The owner of a tract of land located in any "B-1" or "B-2" District
or near a proposed shopping center which is shown on the Land Use Plan and
containing not less than two acres for a center in a "B-1" District or ten
acres in a "B-2" District, shall submit to the Planning Commission for its
review a preliminary plan for the use and development of such tract of land for
an integrated shopping center.  The Planning Commission shall review the
proposal and make recommendations on it to Council.
      (2)   In accepting such plan for review the Commission must be satisfied
that the proponents of the community or regional shopping center are
financially able to carry out the proposed project; that they intend to start
construction within one year of the approval of the project and necessary
change in zoning, and intend to complete it within a reasonable time as
determined by the Commission.
   (b)   Location, Size and Character of Development.
      (1)   The need for the proposed development must be supported by means of
market studies and such other evidence as the Commission may require.
      (2)   The proposed shopping center shall be located so that reasonably
direct traffic access is supplied from principal thoroughfares and where
congestion will not likely be created by the proposed center; or where
congestion will be alleviated by presently projected improvement of access
thoroughfares.
      (3)   The plan shall provide for a shopping center consisting of one or
more groups of establishments in buildings of integrated and harmonious design,
together with adequate and properly arranged traffic and parking facilities and
landscaping, which will fit harmoniously into the adjoining or surrounding
development.
   (c)   Permitted Uses.  The uses permitted in a community shopping center
shall be those retail business, commercial and service uses permitted in the
"B-2" District.  Uses permitted in a neighborhood shopping center shall be the
uses permitted in the "B-1" District.
   (d)   Design Regulations.  The following regulations shall apply to an
integrated shopping center:
      (1)   Building heights.  No building shall exceed three stories or
thirty-five feet in height, except as modified by Section
1125.05  of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Yards.  No building shall be less than fifty feet distant from any
boundary of the tract on which the shopping center is located.  The center
shall be permanently screened from all adjoining properties located in any "R"
District by a solid wall or compact evergreen hedge at least six feet in
height.  Such wall or hedge shall be placed at least five feet from the
property line.
      (3)   Tract coverage.  The ground area occupied by all the buildings
shall not exceed in the aggregate thirty percent of the total area of the lot
or tract.
      (4)   Customer parking space.  Notwithstanding any other requirements of
this Zoning Ordinance, there shall be provided one off-street space for each
100 square feet of rental floor space not including basement storage space, in
the shopping center.
      (5)   Loading space.  Notwithstanding any other requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance there shall be provided one off-street loading or unloading
space for each 20,000 square feet or fraction thereof of aggregate floor space
of all buildings in the center.  At least one-third of the spaces required
shall be sufficient in area and vertical clearance to accommodate trucks of the
tractor-trailer type.
      (6)   Access drives and illumination of parking areas.  Access drives
shall be at a minimum interval of 300 feet and illumination of parking areas
shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining premises in
any "R" District.
      (7)   Signs.  Each center shall be permitted two free-standing signs not
over thirty feet in height, having a maximum total area of 100 square feet and
located not closer than ten feet to any street line and not closer than 100
feet to the adjoining lot line.  A single identification pylon or similar
structure of a height in excess of thirty feet and in harmony with the design
of the buildings shall be permitted in a shopping center.  All signs within the
center shall be controlled by written agreement between the owners and tenants
of the center, or otherwise, to avoid excessive advertising and ensure a
harmonious appearance to the center as a whole.  In a shopping center, all
signs shall only be indirectly illuminated, and all signs shall conform to the
distance requirements from property lines for the buildings in the center.
   (e)   Submission and Approval of Final Development Plan. 
      (1)   Upon determination by the Commission that the proposed integrated
shopping center as shown by the preliminary plan appears to conform to the
requirements of this section and all applicable requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance, the proponents shall prepare and submit a final development plan,
which plan shall incorporate any changes or modifications required or suggested
by the Commission.
      (2)   If the final development plan is found to comply with requirements
set forth in this section and other applicable provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance, the Commission shall submit such plan with its report and
recommendations, together with the required application by the proponents of
the necessary change in zoning classification of the site of the proposed
center, to Council which shall hold a public hearing on both the development
plan and application for a change in zoning.
      (3)   Following a public hearing, Council may modify the plan, consistent
with the intent and meaning of this Zoning Ordinance, and may re-zone the
property to the classification permitting the proposed center, for development
in substantial conformity with the final plan as approved by Council.
      (4)   After the final development plan has been approved by Council and
in carrying out this plan, adjustments or rearrangements of buildings, parking
areas, entrances, heights or yards, may be requested by the proponents, and
provided such requests conform to the standards established by the final
development plan and this Zoning Ordinance, such adjustments or rearrangements
may be authorized by Council.

1151.01  SHORT TITLE.
   This Title Five shall be known and may be cited as the "Subdivision
Regulations for the City of East Liverpool, Ohio" and shall hereinafter be
referred to as "these Regulations".
1151.02  INTERPRETATION AND PURPOSE.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these Regulations
shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the protection of the
public health, safety and welfare.  To protect the public, among other
purposes, such provisions are intended to provide for permanently wholesome
community environment, adequate public services and safer streets and highways.
1151.03  SCOPE.
   These Regulations shall not apply to any lot or lots forming a part of a
subdivision created and recorded prior to the effective date of these
Regulations.  Nor is it intended by these Regulations to repeal, abrogate,
annul or in any way impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws
or regulations, except those specifically repealed by these Regulations, or
with private restriction placed upon property by deed, covenant or other
private agreement, or with restrictive covenants running with the land to which
the Municipality is a party.  Where these Regulations impose a greater
restriction upon land than is imposed or required by such existing provisions
of law, ordinance, contract or deed, the provisions of these Regulations shall
control.
1151.04  ADMINISTRATION AND AUTHORITY.
   A Major Highway Plan having been adopted by the Planning Commission
according to statutory requirements, Council, by virtue of Ohio R.C. Chapter
711, is authorized, subject to the holding of required public hearings, to
adopt rules and regulations covering plats for subdivisions of land, and to
approve, conditionally approve or disapprove plats or subdivisions of land
falling within their jurisdiction.  Administration of the rules and regulations
contained herein shall be the responsibility of the Planning Commission.
1151.05  JURISDICTION AND APPROVAL.
   The provisions of these Regulations shall apply to all plats, subdivisions
and conveyances of land in the City or within three miles of the corporate
limits thereof as described in Ohio R.C. 711.09.  The Planning Commission shall
have the power of final approval of the plats, except that the provisions of
Chapter
1157 within the three-mile radius shall be the jurisdiction of the County
Engineer.
   (a)   No person shall subdivide or lay out into lots any land within the
Municipality or the three-mile area unless it is done by a plat complying with
the regulations herein contained, and no plat shall be recorded and no lot or
land shall be sold from any such plat until such plat has been approved as
herein required.
   (b)   The design and layout of all subdivisions shall conform with the
requirements of these Regulations.  The subdivider shall make improvements and
shall submit preliminary and final plans, all in accordance with these
Regulations.
   (c)   The division of a tract into five parcels or less, fronting upon an
existing street, and where the transfer is to be accomplished by the recording
of a deed rather than a plat, requires the approval of the Planning Commission
before it can be recorded.  Such approval may be accomplished in the manner
provided in these Regulations.
1151.06  PUBLIC HEARING.
   The Planning Commission, on its own initiative or upon petition by a citizen
or neighboring property owner, may, prior to acting on a preliminary map of a
subdivision, hold a hearing thereon at such time and upon such notice as the
Commission may designate.
1151.07  EFFECTIVE DATE.
   These Regulations shall be effective following adoption by the City Planning
Commission and by Council, after public hearing and certification to the
Recorder as provided by law.  Henceforth, any other regulations previously
adopted by Council or the Planning Commission shall be deemed to be repealed. 
These Regulations shall in no way affect any subdivision having received
preliminary approval by the Commission prior to the effective date, provided,
however, that no changes to the preliminary plan, as approved, are introduced
by the subdivider.
1151.08  AMENDMENTS.
   Council may, after public hearing, amend, supplement or change these
Regulations.  Notice shall be given of the time and place of such public
hearing by publication in at least one newspaper of general circulation
published in the local area thirty days prior to holding such hearing.  The

the Commission as to the date of the submission of the plat for approval, and
the failure to take action within such time, shall be sufficient in lieu of the
written endorsement or evidence of approval herein required.  If disapproved,
the grounds for disapproval of the final plat shall be stated on the record of
the Commission, including the reference to the regulation violated by the plat,
and a copy of such record of the Commission shall be forwarded to the
subdivider.
      (2)   The subdivider shall be notified of the final approval of the plat
by the Commission.
   (i)   Recording of Final Plat.  After the final plat has been approved by
the Planning Commission and the City Engineer and the necessary approvals
endorsed in writing thereon, together with evidence of title, it may then be
filed for recording in the office of the Recorder of Columbiana County, Ohio,
as required by law.
1153.05  DEED TRANSFERS.
   (a)   Whenever any transfer of parcels is to be made, as described in
Section
1151.05(c), the party or parties desiring to make the transfer shall submit a
sketch thereof to the Planning Commission.  If the division conforms to
appropriate standards, the responsible official may stamp same "Approved, No
Plat Required", and attach his signature, and the appropriate transfer may then
be recorded.  A survey and stamping of deed is required in any case.

1154.01  INTENT.
   The purpose of the planned unit development (“PUD)”) district provisions is
to provide means of development that is flexible and innovative when
development of a site by standard, more rigid, conventional zoning district
regulations may produce less efficient use of the land and less amenities and
benefits for the community and users of the development. Development under
planned unit development provisions provides a means for encouraging ingenuity,
imagination and flexibility on the part of landowners, engineers, architects,
site planners and developers in the planning and design of land areas. It is
not the intent of the planned unit development provisions to allow applicants
to circumvent the intent of this Zoning Code or to allow development of land
not in conformance with the Land Use Plan of the City.
(Ord. 46, 2015.  Passed 9-8-15.)
1154.02  PUD APPLICABILITY.
   The use of the Planned Unit Development procedures contained in this Chapter
are not mandatory for the development of any parcel of land.  The intent and
purpose of this process is to administratively encourage an alternative
procedure, which maximizes the utilization of land primarily for the benefit,
use and enjoyment of the businesses and residents of that area, as well as the
existing community.
   Proposals for development shall be developed under PUD district provisions
when the Director determines the development proposal exhibits one or more of
the following listed characteristics or a characteristic of similar magnitude
or nature.
   (a)   The total gross area of the proposed development is ten acres or more
in size, except:
      (1)   Detached single-family developments of less than 100 lots submitted
for development under R-1, R-2 and R-3 zoning district requirements;
      (2)   Multi-family developments submitted under R-4 zoning district
requirements;
      (3)   Developments proposed for A-1 zoned property and all of the uses
proposed for the development are permitted by A-1 zoning; or
      (4)   Expansions of existing business and industrial developments with
the appropriate zoning designation.
   (b)   The proposed development involves uses permitted by standard zoning
districts in accordance with the provisions of Chapter
1101 through
1159 of this code, and such uses are permitted by one or more PUD Districts,
and without PUD District Zoning classification the development would normally
require the approval of more than one standard zoning district.
      (Ord. 46, 2015.  Passed 9-8-15.)
1154.03  TYPES OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
   Types of planned unit development districts include B-PUD (Business Planned
Unit Development), MX-PUD (Mixed Use Planned Unit Development), and M-PUD
(Industrial Planned Unit Development).  Each PUD District shall govern by the
requirements specified for each respective PUD District and the general
provisions governing Planned Unit Developments.
(Ord. 46, 2015.  Passed 9-8-15.)
1154.04  GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (a)   Definitions and Interpretation.  For the purpose of this chapter,

structure.  Such term shall not include buildings or structures in which
accessory uses are conducted.
   MAIN USE.  The principal use or uses to which the premises are devoted and
the principal purpose of purposes for which the premises exist.
   OPEN SPACE.  Any area or areas within a development not covered by
structures, parking lots, asphalt and/or concrete pavement.  As determined by
the Planning Commission, walkways and certain structure that are an integral
part of a landscaping and beautification plan for development may be counted as
open space.
   PUD.  The Planned Unit Development.
   PUD AGREEMENT.  An agreement, entered into between the City and the
developer, intended to assure the completion of certain improvements, either
not usually included in a subdivider’s agreement and performance bond or in the
absence of a subdivider’s agreement and performance bond, which may not
otherwise be completed in a timely and satisfactory manner.  Such improvements
may include, but are not limited to, landscaping, roadway improvements, and
detention facilities.
   SPECIFIC SITE PLAN.  A detailed development plan for a part of, or all of, a
planned unit development indicating the specific proposed locations of
structures and signs, parking areas, means of vehicular access and movement,
pedestrian walkways, landscaping and open space, lighting plans, buffering and
screening devices, utility services, drainage and runoff control systems, and
other details required by this chapter.
   SLOPE.  The relationship between the change in elevation of land (rise) and
the horizontal distance over which that change in elevation occurs (run). 
Slope shall be calculated by dividing the rise by the run, multiplied by 100,
and expressed as a percentage.
   SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS.  The Planning Commission or City Council may
require conditions that modify or alter proposed PUD zoning classification
application or specific site plan applications.
   (b)   Project Control and Ownership.  Planned unit development district
designation is intended to apply to development sites that are under single
ownership or unified control.  The project land may be owned, leased, or
controlled by either one or more persons, partnerships, corporations or other
appropriate business associations capable of satisfying the objectives and
requirements of the planned unit development district.  The City may require
proof of ownership, covenants, easements, and other forms of property rights or
control to ensure satisfactory compliance with PUD objectives and requirements.
   (c)   PUD Agreement.  Upon approval of a specific site plan, the City shall
require the PUD developer to enter into a PUD agreement with the City, and to
furnish a performance bond for the purposes of assuring completion of all
requirements for improvements such as landscaping and drainage control
facilities and any conditions and safeguards as may be set by the City Council
and the adopted ordinance approving the specific PUD development.  At its
discretion, the City may accept a letter of credit or other form of performance
guarantee and security in lieu of a performance bond.  In all cases the
sufficiency and adequacy of such bond, letter of credit or other form of
guarantee or security shall be at the sole determination of the City.
   (d)   Utility Requirements.  All initial and all future expanded utility
systems within the limits of all planned unit development districts are
required to be placed underground.  Utility systems subject to this requirement
shall be those that primarily serve the development within the PUD district and
shall include, but not be limited to telephone, cable television, and electric
systems.  Appurtenances of these systems which can be effectively screened may
be excluded from this requirement if the Planning Staff determines that such
appurtenances are essential for utility service to other areas of the community
and that such exclusion will not violate the intent or character of the
proposed planned unit development or any conditions, restrictions or other
requirements imposed upon the development.
   (e)   Application Process and Sequence.  Due to the flexible and special
character of planned unit development districts and projects, and to assist
reviewing authorities in evaluating the merits and making findings of proposed
PUD projects, the full PUD approval process generally involves either a two
stage review or a single stage/concurrent review.  The applicant may select
either the two-stage review process or the single stage/concurrent review
process.  Unless the applicant informs the Planning Director at the time of
submission of the PUD zoning classification application of selection of the
single stage/concurrent review process, the applicant shall be considered to
have selected the two stage review process.
      (1)   Two-stage review process.
         A.   First stage.  The first stage of the two-stage PUD review process
shall consist of submission of an application for PUD zoning classification in
accordance with division (f) of this section and Section
1154.05(a) - (c).  The Planning Commission shall review and make a
recommendation on the PUD zoning classification application in accordance with
Section
1154.05(d) - (f).  The City Council then, in accordance with Section
1154.05(g) and (h), reviews the PUD zoning classification application and makes
a decision to approve as submitted, approve with supplementary conditions or
disapprove the application.  Approval of PUD zoning classification constitutes
only approval of PUD district zoning for the subject property.  A specific site
plan shall be submitted and approved prior to the issuance of a City zoning
permit for the subject property.
         B.   Second stage.  Unless the applicant selects the single stage/
concurrent review process as per division (i)(2) of this section, the second
stage of the two-stage PUD approval process begins at the initiation of the
applicant and only if the PUD zoning classification application submitted in
the first stage was approved or approved with supplementary conditions by City
Council.  The second stage generally consists of submission of a specific site
plan for the subject property in accordance with division (f) of this section
and Section
1154.06(a), (b), (e) and (f).  An administrative review and recommendation upon
the specific site plan application is then conducted by the Planning Commission
in accordance with Section
1154.06(g), (h) and (i).  The City Council then, in accordance with Section
1154.06(j) and (k), reviews the specific site plan application and makes an
administrative decision to approve the application as submitted, approve with
supplementary conditions or disapprove.
      (2)   Single stage/concurrent review process.  At the applicant’s option
the first and second stage of the two-stage review process may be combined for
a single/stage concurrent review process.  If the applicant elects such option,
a PUD zoning classification application and a related specific site plan
application, in accordance with Section
1154.05(c) and
1154.06(b) shall be simultaneously submitted by the applicant and both
applications shall proceed through a single stage/concurrent review process. 
In such case, the Planning Commission shall concurrently review both
applications, but shall make a recommendation upon the PUD zoning
classification prior to making a recommendation upon the specific site plan
application.  The City Council then shall concurrently review both
applications, but shall first act upon the PUD zoning classification prior to
taking administrative action upon the specific site plan application.
   (f)   Application Completeness and Officially Filed Status.  Planned unit
development and specific site plan applications shall not be considered
officially filed until the applicant has submitted all applicable filing fees,
and submitted to the Planning Department all information as may be required by
this Zoning Code.  Completeness of an application and submission of all
necessary information is the responsibility of the applicant.  Only after an
application is determined by the Director to be complete and officially filed
will application review procedures begin.  Applications for specific site plan
approval that do not adhere to the substantial conformance requirements of
Section
1154.06(e) may be considered to be incomplete, not officially filed, and not
subject to City review procedures.
   (g)   Site Arrangement Requirements.  The buildings, circulation, open
space, landscaping and other elements of the proposed PUD development shall be
arranged, planned and designed on the site to produce:
      (1)   Favorable relationships with the existing natural topography,
bodies of water or water courses, existing desirable vegetation, exposure to
significant views and exposure to sunlight and wind;
      (2)   Safety, convenience and ease of pedestrian and vehicular movement
on,  about and throughout the site and between the site and the community;
      (3)   An overall positive visual quality throughout, into and from the
development site;
      (4)   An efficient, functionally organized, and cohesive development; and
      (5)   All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for
immediate improvements or development shall be landscaped or otherwise
maintained in a neat and orderly manner.
   (h)   Zoning Map Identification.  Areas approved as a planned unit
development district will be clearly marked and identified on the zoning map by
indicating the specific PUD district upon which approval was granted, either B-
PUD, MX-PUD, or M-PUD; followed by the appropriate case number.
   (i)   Multiple PUD Projects.  A proposed PUD project, either voluntary or
mandatory, shall be considered a “multiple PUD project” when each individual
use proposed for the project is permitted by at least one of the various PUD
zoning districts while at the same time all of the proposed uses for the
project are not permitted by only one, single PUD zoning district (Example: B-
PUD).  A multiple PUD project requires differing PUD district zoning
classifications for respective, contiguous portions of the property proposed
for development.  When the proposed development is a multiple PUD project the
applicant shall file a single PUD zoning application, identifying each specific
PUD zoning district, incorporating a functional and general location phasing
plan for each individual PUD, a functional and general locational sequencing
schedule for the full multiple PUD project, and all other necessary application
materials as per Section
1154.05(c).  A multiple PUD differs from an MX-PUD (Section 1154.12) in that
the differing uses (such as, residential mixed with commercial) are located in
the distinctive appropriate PUD District.
   (j)   Transition of PUD Provisions and Regulations. 
      (1)   Effective date of Sections
1154.01 through
1154.13 revisions.  The provisions and regulations of this Zoning Code
pertaining to planned unit developments, Sections
1154.01 through
1154.13, have hereby been established by Ordinance No. 46, 2015.  As used in
this section, the effective date of the planned unit development provisions and
regulations is the same as the effective date of Ordinance No. 46, 2015.
      (2)   Applications filed prior to effective date.  All PUD applications
and all requests to modify, change, amend or alter a PUD that are officially
filed shall be governed by the PUD provisions and regulations in effect on the
official filing date of the application or request.
      (3)   Applications filed after effective date.  On and after the
effective date, all PUD applications and all requests to modify, change or
alter a PUD shall be governed by the PUD provisions and regulations in effect
at that time.
   (k)   Appeal of Director Determination.  In order to assure that Planning
Commission and City Council have all information pertinent to the decision
making process contained within this chapter, the Director has been given the
responsibility to require additional information as necessary in order for
Planning Commission and City Council to make an informed decision.  Any
applicant who objects to the provision of additional information may request a
determination by Planning Commission at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
No further action shall take place regarding the application and submission
until the Planning Commission has rendered its decision, which shall be final.
(Ord. 46, 2015.  Passed 9-8-15.)

shall not invalidate the public hearing or any decision on the application.
   (e)   Planning Commission Review and Recommendation of PUD Application. 
After a planned unit development application has been determined to be
officially filed in accordance with Section
1154.04(f), the Planning Commission shall review and study the application and
any accompanying materials.  In the course of its study the Commission may
confer with other agencies of government, request additional information or
clarification from the applicant, and request additional study and comments
from the Planning Department staff.  Within 30 days after completion of the
public hearing required in division (d) of this section, the Planning
Commission shall, by resolution, recommend to the City Council that the request
for planned unit development zoning classification be approved as presented, or
approved with supplementary conditions or modifications, or disapproved.  The
Commission shall then transmit to the City Council all papers constituting the
record and the resolution containing the Commission’s recommendation.  If the
Commission recommends approval with supplementary conditions, such conditions
shall be fully expressed in the recommendation resolution.  Any normally
permitted or accessory use that is recommended to be excluded from the specific
planned unit development shall be fully identified and expressed in the
Commission’s resolution and based upon findings in accordance with Sections
1154.11(b),
1154.12(b) and
1154.13(b).  If the Planning Commission determines, in order to conduct a

satisfy the standards and criteria for planned unit development approval as per
division (i) of this section.
   (g)   City Council Public Hearing and Notice.  Within ten days after the
receipt of the Planning Commission recommendation and resolution, the Clerk of
City Council shall set a date for a City Council public hearing and such
hearing, notwithstanding Section
1109.02(f) of this  code, shall be held as soon as reasonably possible
thereafter.  Before holding such public hearing, notice of the hearing shall be
given in accordance with Section
1109.02(f) of this code.  Notwithstanding Section
1109.02(g) of this code, notice shall also be provided by certified mail at
least 20 days prior to the date of the hearing, and such notice shall be deemed
given on the date of mailing.  Mailed notices shall be provided to all owners
of property within 200 feet from the exterior boundaries of the area proposed
for PUD zoning classification.  Mailed, newspaper publication and any forms of
notice utilized in lieu of mailed notice shall set forth the time and place of
the public hearing and the nature of the proposed development.  The failure to
deliver the notice as provided in this section shall not invalidate the pubic
hearing or any decision on the application.
   (h)   Action by City Council.  Within 30 days after completion of the public
hearing as required in division (g) of this section, the Council shall, by an
affirmative vote of at least four of its members, either deny the
recommendation of the Planning Commission or introduce and hold the first
reading of an ordinance adopting or modifying such recommendation.  Following
the second reading of the ordinance, a planned unit development zoning
classification request shall be approved, approved with supplementary
conditions, or disapproved at least four members of City Council.  In the event
the City Council approves the planned unit development, with or without
supplementary conditions, the Council shall find, by ordinance, that the facts
submitted with the application and presented at the public hearing, and any
modifications, amendments or supplementary conditions satisfy the standards and
criteria for planned unit development approval as per division (i) of this
section.  If City Council approves the Planned Unit Development zoning
classification , the approval ordinance shall fully set forth any and all

   (a)   Notice to Applicants.  Notice is hereby provided to all applicants
that:
      (1)   Approval of PUD zoning classification shall not be deemed approval
of a specific site plan or approval of a zoning permit;
      (2)   The issuance of a City zoning permit for all or any portion of a
PUD project requires City Council approval of a specific site plan; and
      (3)   In accordance with divisions (c) and (d) of this section, unless an
extended approval period is granted by City Council, approval of any specific
site plan shall expire if actual construction has not been completed in either
phases or its entirety in the area of approval for the respective specific site
plan within five years from the effective date of City Council approval of the
plan.  In accordance with Section
1154.04(f), the specific site plan shall proceed through the review and
approval process as per divisions (g) - (k) of this section, and shall be
approved by City Council.  The applicant shall submit a specific site plan
application only after the subject property has been granted PUD zoning
classification approval; however, an applicant may elect to submit the specific
site plan application at the same time as submission of PUD zoning
classification application.  If the applicant elects such option, a PUD zoning
classification application, as per Section
1154.05(c), and a related specific site plan application, as per division (d)
of this section, shall be simultaneously submitted by the applicant and
reviewed concurrently by the City as per Section
1154.04(f).  All specific site plan applications shall incorporate a minimum
area of five acres (phasing).  In cases in which the total gross area of the

In the event of expiration of an approved specific site plan, the applicant
shall start afresh, submit a specific site plan application in accordance with
Section
1154.04(f) and division (d) of this section, and the application shall proceed
through the review and approval process as per divisions (g) - (k) of this
section.
   (c)   Extension of Specific Site Plan Approval Period.  Upon request by the
owner, a one-time only, administrative extension of the five-year approval
period for a specific site plan may be granted by the City Council.  In the
event such an extension is granted the period of extension shall not exceed two
years.  The owner shall submit a written request for an extended site plan
approval period to the Director.  The written request shall be submitted no
sooner than nine months prior to, but no later than 90 days prior to the

PUD project.  Within 30 days from the Director’s receipt of the owner’s written
request the Director shall forward the owner’s request and the Director’s
comments and recommendation to the City Council.  Within 30 days after City
Council receives the request and the Director’s comments and recommendations,
the Council shall take administrative action upon the request.  The City
Council shall, by resolution and administrative action, deny the request for
extension, approve the request for extension as submitted, or approve the
request for extension for a lesser period of time than requested by the owner. 
Any extension of approval period for a specific site plan shall become
effective and begin to run on the date of Council approval of such extension.

copy of its acceptance shall be filed in conjunction with this application; and
      (17)   Any additional information that may be required by the Director
within 15 days of the date of submission.
   (e)   Specific Site Plan Conformance with Approved PUD.
      (1)   An officially filed specific site plan shall substantially conform
to the PUD zoning plans, concepts, schedules and development information as
approved by City Council.  If the Director or the Planning Commission
determines that the officially filed specific site plan does not substantially
conform, the applicant may either modify the specific site plan to the extent
necessary for substantial conformance and resubmit for review, or start afresh
and submit a new specific site plan for review, or apply for an amendment to
the PUD zoning classification ordinance.  Notwithstanding Section
1154.04(f), a submitted specific site plan shall not be considered officially
filed if the Director determines prior to Planning Commission review that the
submitted specific site plan does not adhere to the substantial conformance
requirement.
      (2)   At the discretion of the Planning Commission, a submitted specific
site plan that contains modifications to the plans, concepts, schedules and
development information as approved by City Council, may be determined to
substantially conform.  In no event shall a specific site plan be determined to
substantially conform if the specific site plan involves changes in permitted
uses as per Section
1154.08, or changes which result in exceeding any limitation or any maximum
amount imposed by an ordinance originally granting or amending the PUD zoning
classification for the subject property.
   (f)   Planning Commission Public Hearing and Notice.  The Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing on an officially filed specific site
plan application within 30 days after the application’s official filing date. 
Before holding such hearing, notice of the hearing shall be given in accordance
with Section
1109.02(c) of the Codified Ordinances.  Notwithstanding Section
1109.02(c) of the Codified Ordinances, notice shall also be provided by
certified mail at least 20 days prior to the date of the hearing, and such
notice shall be deemed given on the date of mailing.  Mailed notices shall be
given to all owners of property located within 200 feet from the exterior
boundaries of the PUD zoning property which contains the area proposed for
specific site plan approval.  Mailed, newspaper publication and any forms of
notice utilized in lieu of mailed notice shall set forth the time and place of
the public hearing and the nature of the proposed specific site plan.  The
failure to deliver the notice as provided in this section shall not invalidate
the public hearing or any decision on the application.
   (g)   Recommendation by Planning Commission.  Within 30 days after
completion of the public hearing required in division (f) of this section, the
Planning Commission shall take administrative action and, by resolution,
recommend to the City Council that the submitted specific site plan be approved
as presented, or approved with supplementary conditions or modification, or
disapproved.  The Commission shall then transmit all papers constituting the
record and the resolution containing the Commission’s recommendation to the
Council.  All resolutions for specific site plan recommendations to City
Council shall indicate the Commission is taking administrative action, and if
the Commission’s recommendation is for approval with supplementary conditions,
the resolution shall fully express such conditions.  If the Planning Commission
determines in order to conduct a sufficient review and make its recommendation
that additional information is required from the applicant or additional study
is required, the Commission may table consideration of the application until
such additional information is received by the Commission or the Commission’s
study is complete.
   (h)   Criteria for Planning Commission Recommendation.  Before making a
recommendation for approval or approval with supplementary conditions in
accordance with division (g) of this section, the Planning Commission shall
find, by resolution, that the facts submitted with the specific site plan
application and presented at the public hearing, and any modifications,
amendments or supplementary conditions, satisfy the standards and criteria for
specific site plan approval as per division (k) of this section.
   (i)   City Council Public Hearing and Action.  Within ten days after the
receipt of the Planning Commission recommendation, the Clerk of the City
Council shall set a date for a public hearing and such hearing, notwithstanding
Section
1109.02(f) of the Codified Ordinances, shall be held as soon as reasonably
possible thereafter, not to exceed sixty (60) days from the date of the
original Planning Commission recommendation.  The public hearing shall be for
the purposes of taking administrative action on the proposed specific site
plan.  Following the schedule hearing the City Council shall, by motion,
approve, approve with supplementary conditions, or disapprove the proposed
specific site plan.  Approval of such motion requires a vote of at least four
members of the Council.  If the Council approves the specific site plan with
supplementary conditions, the motion for approval shall fully set forth such
conditions and be fully recorded in the meeting minutes.  As the basis for City
Council approval of a specific site plan, with or without supplementary
conditions, Council shall find that the facts submitted with the application
and any accompanying materials, and any modifications, amendments or
supplementary conditions satisfy the standards and criteria for specific site
plan approval as per division (k) of this section.  If the standards and
criteria of division (1) of this section are not satisfied, Council shall
disapprove the specific site plan and shall make findings of fact indicating
which particular standards and criteria are not satisfied.  If the City Council
determines in order to conduct a sufficient review and make it decision that
additional information is required from the applicant or additional study is
required, the Council may table consideration of the application until such
additional information is received by the Council or the Council’s study is
complete.  Any decision rendered by City Council shall be completed within 60
days from the Planning Commission’s recommendation.
   (j)   Notice of City Council Public Hearing.  Before holding the public
hearing specified in division (i) of this section, notice shall be provided in
accordance with Section
1109.02(f) of this code.  Notwithstanding Section
1109.02(g) of this code, notice shall also be provided by certified mail at
least 20 days prior to the date of the hearing, and such notice shall be deemed
given on the date of mailing.  Mailed notices shall be provided to all owners
of property within 200 feet from the exterior boundaries of the PUD zoning
property which contains the area proposed for specific site plan approval. 
Mailed, newspaper, and any forms of notice utilized in lieu of mailed notice
shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing and the nature of the
proposed specific site plan.  The failure to deliver the notice as provided in
this section shall not invalidate the public hearing or any decision on the
application.
   (k)   Standards and Criterial for Specific Site Plan Approval.  A specific
site plan shall only be approved when the following standards and criteria are
satisfied.
      (1)   The specific site plan complies with the purpose and intent of this
Zoning Code and the Planned Unit Development designation;

acceptance must be filed with the application.
         (Ord. 46, 2015.  Passed 9-8-15.)
1154.07  PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE BINDING AND ENFORCEABLE
CONDITIONS.
   If any portion of property included in a planned unit development is sold or
leased, the PUD zoning classification and specific site plan obligations shall
continue to be binding upon all subsequent owners or lessees, regardless of the
acreage involved in the sale or lease.  As a matter of procedure, all terms and
conditions of any planned unit development zoning classification and specific
site plan that were approved by the City Council in the past or may be approved
in the future shall remain binding upon and enforceable against the subject
tract of land, except to the extent modified in accordance with Section
1154.10(a) through (c).
(Ord. 46, 2015.  Passed 9-8-15.)
1154.08  MODIFICATIONS TO PUD PERMITTED USES.
   The permitted uses for an approved PUD development include all uses
identified as permitted and accessory uses for the type of PUD district under
which the PUD development was approved, except those uses expressly identified
as excluded uses in the ordinance granting PUD zoning approval for the subject
property (Example: The permitted uses for an approved B-PUD development include
all uses permitted in the B-PUD District, except any uses listed as excluded
uses in the ordinance which granted B-PUD zoning for the property on which the
development is located).  Upon PUD zoning approval, an applicant is not
required to develop all uses permitted for the applicant’s specific PUD
development; however, an applicant shall only develop those uses permitted for
the specific PUD development.  Any request to modify or change the permitted
uses of a specific PUD development, as such uses are identified in Section
1154.11(b),
1154.12(b) and
1154.13(b) and as may be conditioned by the original ordinance granting PUD
zoning classification for the subject property, requires an amendment to such
ordinance.  Upon a request to modify or change the permitted uses for a
specific PUD, the City, at its discretion, shall require the applicant to
either submit a new, full application in accordance with Section
1154.05(c), or submit a modified PUD zoning application, or submit
supplementary materials to accompany the original PUD zoning application
materials.  In all cases, proposed amendments to the original zoning ordinance
shall be subject to review and approval procedures in accordance with Section
1154.05(d) - (i).  (Ord. 46, 2015.  Passed 9-8-15.)
1154.09  SIMILARITY OF USES AND SPECIAL USES.
   (a)   Similarity of Uses.  The Planning Commission shall have the
appropriate power and duty to determine if uses not specifically mentioned in
this Zoning Code are similar to uses permitted in planned unit development
districts.  In no event shall a determination of similarity of use by the
Planning Commission overrule a City Council determination of exclusion of uses
from a specific PUD, and the ordinance originally granting or amending PUD
zoning classification shall govern.  If a PUD zoning classification application
includes a list of intended uses, which requires a determination of similarity,
the Planning Commission shall make such determination at the time of its review
and recommendation on the PUD zoning application.
   (b)   PUD Special Uses.  City Council shall have the appropriate power and
duty to hear and decide upon applications for special uses, which are requested
to be approved uses within a PUD.  The Planning Commission shall make a
recommendation of approval, denial, or approval with conditions for PUD special
use applications.  After receipt and consideration of the Commission
recommendation, the Council shall approve, deny or approve with conditions the
special use application.  In approving the PUD special use application, the
Council may attach appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Code and the Commission’s recommendation.  Approval
of a special use application shall expire one year after the effective date of
the City Council approval, unless actual construction has started for the
special use.
(Ord. 46, 2015.  Passed 9-8-15.)
1154.10  MODIFICATIONS TO APPROVED SPECIFIC SITE PLANS.
   Requests to modify an approved specific site plan, when such requested
modification does not involve a change of permitted uses for the specific PUD,
may be approved by administrative action.  Requests to modify shall be in
writing and signed by the property owner.  The Director shall determine the
type and amount of any additional information necessary for consideration of
the modification.  Modifications shall be considered major, minor or
incidental, and shall be approved or disapproved by administrative action in
accordance with divisions (a), (b) and (c) of this section.  Requests to modify
an approved specific site plan which involve a change of PUD  permitted uses
shall be considered a modification to PUD permitted uses and shall comply with
Section
1154.08.
   (a)   Major Modifications.  Major modifications are defined as modifications
which do not change the PUD’s permitted uses and do not exceed any of the
limitations and conditions of the PUD’s approval ordinance, and which result in
an increase of 5% or more in building coverage; a 5% or greater increase in
dwelling unit density; a  significant redesign of roadways, or drainage; an
increase of greater than five feet in the height of a non-related building
structure; major design or a building which significantly alters the central
architectural design or theme of the building; or modifications not considered
to be of minor or incidental character.  Major modifications to an approved
specific site plan require resubmission of a specific site plan application in
accordance with Section
1154.06(d).  At its discretion and in lieu of compliance with Section
1154.06(d), the Planning Commission may require the applicant to either submit
a modified application or submit supplementary materials to accompany the
original specific site plan application materials.  In all cases major
modifications to approved specific site plans shall be subject to review and
approval procedures in accordance with Section
1154.06(f) thru (k).
   (b)   Minor Modifications.  Minor modifications are defined as modifications
which doe not change the PUD’s permitted uses and do not exceed any of the
limitations and conditions of the PUD’s approval ordinance, and which result in
an increase of less than 5% in building coverage; changes not exceeding 25 feet
in building location not affecting front yard setbacks from streets or setbacks
from exterior property lines of the PUD; an increase of more than two feet but
less than five feet in the height of any non-related building structure; minor
redesign of a building such as significant alterations to exterior materials or
colors provided the redesign does not significantly alter the central
architectural design or theme of th building; or changes not considered to be
of major or incidental modification character.  The Planning Commission shall,
by motion, approve or disapprove minor modifications to approved specific site
plans.  Such approval shall be based on Commission determination that the
modifications are not in conflict with the intent and character of the approved
specific site plan and such modifications do not change the permitted uses for
the specific PUD.  Minor modifications do not require a public hearing and
Planning Commission’s decision shall be final.
   (c)   Incidental Modifications.  Incidental modifications are defined as
modifications which do not change the PUD’s permitted uses and do not exceed
any of the limitations and conditions of the PUD’s approval ordinance, and
which result in less building coverage due to decreasing the size of
structures; a decrease in the number of structures; a decrease in the number of
dwelling units in a MX-PUD; minor redesign of PUD streets, such as adjustments
in a turning radius; minor redesign, such as a realignment, of pedestrian
circulation facilities or parking or loading areas; changes in landscaping or
screening materials that do not alter the intended function of the landscaping
or screening; an increase of two feet or less in the height of a building or
structure; minor revisions of building elevations such a realignment of major
building entrances or window placement, or significant alterations to exterior
building materials or colors, provided the revisions do not alter the central
design or architectural theme of a building; or changes not considered to be of
minor or major modification character.  The Director shall approve or
disapprove incidental modifications to approved specific site plans.  Such
approval shall be based on the Director’s determination that the modifications
are not in conflict with the intent and character of the approved specific site
plan and such modifications do not change the permitted uses for the specific
PUD.  In the alternative and at the discretion of the Director, the Director
may request that  incidental modifications be approved by the Planning
Commission.

1154.11  B-PUD COMMERCIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Purpose.  This district is intended to provide for the development of
business, office and commercial establishments within a unified commercial area
and plan of development.  Within this district, business, office and commercial
establishments can be flexibly located to achieve compatible exterior physical
design, to utilize the site more efficiently than allowed by standard zoning
regulations, to take advantage of natural features of the site, to achieve a
higher degree of pedestrian and vehicular separation, to eliminate undesirable
features of strip commercial development, to reduce vehicular traffic conflicts

be excluded from the specific B-PUD when the City Council determines that the
specific permitted or accessory use is inappropriate for the specific B-PUD
development.  Such exclusion(s) shall be based upon at least one of the
following findings that the specific excluded use:
         A.   Cannot be serviced by adequate public utilities; or presents the
potential for significant environmental damage and a satisfactory plan of
mitigation has not been provided by the applicant; or is inconsistent with the
overall character and other uses of the proposed PUD; or is inappropriate for
the topography of the site; or is incompatible with surrounding legal land uses
or other approved land uses; or is inconsistent with the City’s land use plan
or other approved plans of the City; or will create hazardous traffic
conditions; or will impose an unmitigated burden on public services and
facilities, such as fire and police protection; and
         B.   Will not promote the purpose and objectives of the planned unit
development provisions of this code; and
         C.   Does not advance the general welfare of the community and the
immediate vicinity and will adversely affect or impact adjoining or surrounding
development without satisfactory mitigation measures.

way, and to enhance compatibility of the development with its surroundings.
   (b)   M-PUD Permitted and Special Use.
      (1)   Those uses included as permitted and accessory uses in the M-1 and
M-2 Zoning Districts are permitted in an M-PUD District.  One or more of these
permitted and accessory uses may be excluded from the specific M-PUD when the
City Council determines that the specific permitted or accessory use normally
allowed in the industrial Zoning Districts is inappropriate for the specific M-
PUD development.  Such exclusion(s) shall be based upon at least one of the
following findings that the specific exclude use:
         A.   Cannot be serviced by adequate public utilities; or presents the
potential for significant environmental damage and a satisfactory plan of
mitigation has not been provided by the applicant; or is inconsistent with the
overall character and other uses of the proposed PUD; or is inappropriate for
the topography of the site; or is incompatible with surrounding legal land uses
or other approved land uses; or is inconsistent with the City’s land use plan

intensity and lot coverage by all buildings and by buildings and all other
impervious surfaces is as follows:
      Maximum Coverage by All Buildings: 40%
      Maximum Cover by All Buildings and Impervious Surfaces: 75%
   (d)   Building Height.  The maximum height of any building in an M-PUD
District shall be 50 feet, except, at the discretion of the City Council, the
maximum height may be increased when such increase is determined to improve
site design and the overall aesthetic quality of the development, does not
adversely affect surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities, does not
obscure light and air sources to immediately surrounding structures, satisfies
applicable fire and safety regulations, and is necessary for the operation of a
proposed industrial use.
   (e)   Requirements for Screening, Accessory Parking, and Loading and
Unloading Areas.
      (1)   All screening and buffering shall meet the requirements of Section
1127.13, accessory parking shall meet the requirements of Section 1127.08-12,

1155.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width and location of major, secondary
and minor streets or highways shall conform with the Official Thoroughfare Plan
for the City, which is on file with the Clerk of Council and with the
provisions of these Regulations.  Streets not contained in the Official
Thoroughfare Plan should conform to the recommendation of the Commission based
on existing and planned streets, topography, public safety and convenience and
proposed uses of land.
   Neighborhood unit type development is encouraged by the Planning
Commission.  Where large subdivisions designed on the basis of neighborhood
units are being reviewed, consideration will be given to the placement of
commercial areas and public areas, in relation both to the neighborhood unit
being developed and to other units that might be developed.  Where small
subdivisions are being reviewed the Commission shall coordinate such
subdivisions, to the extent practicable, into units so that the same
relationship with respect to commercial areas and public areas may be realized.
1155.02  STREETS.
   (a)   Design and Arrangement.
      (1)   The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make
provisions for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining
area (or their proper projection where adjoining land is not subdivided)
insofar as they may be deemed necessary for public requirements.  Every
subdivision shall have access to a public right of way.
      (2)   The street and alley arrangement shall be such as not to cause
hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek
to provide for convenient access to it.  Residential streets shall be so
designed as to discourage through traffic, but offset streets should be
avoided.
      (3)   The angle of intersection between minor streets and major streets
should not vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle.  All other streets
should intersect each other as near to a right angle as possible.
      (4)   The minimum curb radius shall be twenty feet to the face of the
curb.  Without curb, the minimum pavement radius shall be thirty feet to the
edge of the pavements.
      (5)   Residential streets shall be designed to discourage through traffic
which may otherwise use secondary or major highways, and whose origin and
destination are not within the subdivision.  Residential streets extending for
considerable distance, parallel to any secondary or major street, should be
avoided.
   (b)   Alignment.
      (1)   Vertical.  For main thoroughfares, profile grades shall be
connected by vertical curves of a minimum length equivalent to twenty times the
algebraic difference between the rates of grade, expressed in feet per hundred;
for secondary and minor streets and alleys, fifteen times.
      (2)   Minimum horizontal.  The radii of center line curvature shall be:
 
                              Degrees Feet
Primary thoroughfares         12      475
Secondary thoroughfares       19      300
Minor streets                 28      200
Streets shorter than 500 feet 58      100
A minimum fifty-foot tangent shall be introduced between reverse curves.
      (3)   Visibility requirements. 
         A.   Minimum vertical visibility (measured four and one-half feet eye
level to tail light eighteen inches above ground level) shall be:
      500 feet on primary thoroughfares
      300 feet on secondary thoroughfares
      200 feet on minor streets
      100 feet on streets shorter than 500 feet.
         B.   Minimum horizontal visibility shall be:
      500 feet on main thoroughfares measured on the center line
      300 feet on secondary thoroughfares measured on the center line
      100 feet on all other streets measured on the center line.
   (c)   Street Type and Width.
      (1)   Major thoroughfares.  The width of all major thoroughfares shall
conform to the width designated on the Official Thoroughfare Plan of the City.
      (2)   Collector streets.  The minimum right-of-way widths of all
collector streets shall be sixty feet.
      (3)   Local streets.  The minimum right-of-way width of local streets
shall be fifty feet and the pavement width shall be thirty feet, except where
there are unusual typographical or other physical conditions, in which case the
Commission may require a greater width for a local street.  The minimum width
of local streets serving multiple dwellings shall be sixty feet and the
pavement width shall be thirty-six feet.
      (4)   Location.  When a proposed subdivision is adjacent to or contains a
State highway, the developer and Commission should seek information from the
Ohio Department of Transportation as to the status of the highway in reference
to width, direction and access thereto.
      (5)   Half streets.  Dedication of new half streets shall not be
permitted.  Where a dedicated or platted half street or alley exists adjacent
to the tract being subdivided, the other half shall be platted, if deemed
necessary by the Commission.
      (6)   Cul-de-sacs.  Each cul-de-sac shall be provided with a turn-around
having a minimum right-of-way radius of fifty feet.  The outside of the road
surface within the turn-around right of way shall have a minimum radius of
forty feet.  The maximum length for a cul-de-sac shall be 600 feet.
      (7)   Dead-end streets.  Dead-end streets, designated to be so
permanently, shall not be permitted.  Any dead-end street of a temporary
nature, if longer than 200 feet or fronted by existing lots, shall have a
surfaced turning area equal in diameter to the width of such street at its
termination.
      (8)   Limitation of number of vehicular access points to arterial
highways or major streets.  Safety factors and the need for effective
utilization of the major thoroughfares require limiting the number of vehicular
access points to arterial highways and major streets to promote efficient
traffic movement and reduce safety hazards.  This principle shall be
implemented by the developer as follows:
   Where a subdivision adjoins an arterial highway or major street, vehicular
access to subdivided lots shall be kept to a minimum and shall not exceed the
following standards:
 
Feet of Frontage       Maximum Number of
                       Vehicular Access Points
Less than 500 feet     One
500 feet to 1,000 feet Two
Over 1,000 feet        Two for the first 1,000 feet of frontage; plus one point
                       of access for each additional 1,000 feet of frontage
 
      The local street arrangement connecting with these access points may be
accomplished in one of three ways:
         A.   Marginal access street with a planting strip of a minimum width
of twenty feet between the major street or highway pavement and marginal access
street pavement.  The marginal access street shall have a minimum pavement
width of twenty feet.
         B.   Local street (reverse frontage) with residences facing away from
the major thoroughfare.  In this case, the rear yards (those between the
residences and the major thoroughfare) shall have a minimum depth of seventy
feet which includes a twenty-foot strip reservation abutting the major
thoroughfare for screen planting of trees and shrubs.  A masonry or wooden
ornamental screen may be substituted for the planting.  (See Section
1155.06 (c).)
         C.   Intersecting local streets or cul-de-sac streets perpendicular to
the major thoroughfare.
      (9)   Street grades.  Street grades shall not exceed the following with
due allowances for reasonable vertical curves.  The City Engineer may permit
deviations from these requirements where the topography is such that these
regulations are not practical.
 
                                              Percent
Primary thoroughfare                          5
Secondary thoroughfare                        8
Minor streets and alleys                      12
Streets shorter than 500 feet and cul-de-sacs 15
 
         No street grade shall be less than one percent.
      (10)   Street names.  New names are required for new streets.  The names
shall meet with the approval of the Planning Commission.  No name shall be
similar in spelling or pronounciation to that of an existing street in the City
or the same postal zone.  Streets which are essentially continuous shall have
the same name.
      (11)   Acceptance of streets.  The City Engineer shall, upon written
request by the owner of the land upon which the street has been constructed,
check the construction by stages and if the Engineer finds that such street is
constructed in accordance with the specifications set forth on the approved
plat and that such street is in good repair, then such finding, endorsed on the
approved plat, shall constitute an acceptance of the street for public use by
the City.
1155.03  ALLEYS.
   Alleys should be avoided in single or two-family districts.  They may,
however, be required in multiple-dwelling developments where they should have a
minimum width of twenty feet.  Alleys are required in the rear of all
commercial and industrial lots, if no other provisions are made for adequate
service access or for parking.  The rights of way of such alleys shall not be
less than forty-five feet and dead-end alleys shall not be permitted.
1155.04  BUILDING LINES AND EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Building Lines.  Where the subdivided area is not under zoning control
and is to be used for residential purposes, the average front building line
shall not be less than twenty-five feet from the right of way of the street or
thoroughfare upon which the lots front.
   Restrictions requiring greater setbacks than the above may be required for
commercial and industrial uses, and for residential uses along major highways
as determined by the Commission.
   (b)   Easements.  Easements of at least six feet in width shall be provided
on each side of all rear lot lines and along side lot lines where reasonably
necessary for poles, wires, conduits and gas mains.  Easements may also be
required along or across lots where engineering design or special conditions
may necessitate the installation of water and sewer lines outside public rights
of way.  For lots facing on curvilinear streets the rear easement should
consist of straight lines with a minimum number of points of deflection.
1155.05  BLOCKS.
   (a)   No block shall be longer than 1,320 feet nor less than 500 feet,
except in unusual circumstances.  Where a subdivision adjoins a major highway,
the greater dimension of the block shall front along such major highway to
minimize the number of points of ingress and egress.
   (b)   Where blocks are over 750 feet in length a crosswalk easement not less
than ten feet in width on or near the halfway point may be required if
necessary to provide proper access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers
and other facilities.
1155.06  LOTS.
   (a)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all sublots will
provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to
topography and the character of surrounding development.
   (b)   All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to street lines and
radial to curved street lines except where a variation to this rule will
provide a better street and sublot layout.
   (c)   Reverse frontage lots abutting an intercommunity thoroughfare or major
street and fronting on an interior street within a subdivision shall be of
sufficient depth so as to provide for a minimum rear yard of seventy feet. 
Lots with double frontage shall be avoided except when paralleling major
highways.
   (d)   In case of unusual soil conditions or other physical factors which may
impair the health and safety of the neighborhood in which a subdivision may be
located, upon recommendation of the appropriate Board of Health or the City
Engineer, the Commission may require larger lot widths and lot areas as deemed
necessary.
   (e)   In an established neighborhood, the commission may, at its discretion,
approve the plat of a subdivision containing lots of less width than the
minimum required in the zoning district if the lots conform generally to the
other lots in the neighborhood.
   (g)   Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a minimum
radius of twenty feet.
   (h)   No lot shall have less area or width than is required by the zoning
regulations applying to the area in which it is located.  If zoning is not in
effect in any portion of the area of jurisdiction of these Regulations as
specified in Section
1151.05, the following minimum lots sizes shall be met:
Type of Development Group Sewer and    Group Sewer      Group Sewer and Water

jurisdiction.
1155.07  PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (a)   Recreational Areas, Etc.  consideration shall be given to the
allocation of areas suitably located and of adequate size for playgrounds,
school sites, parks and other outdoor recreational facilities as indicated on
the East Liverpool Master Plan and to be made available by one of the following
methods:
      (1)   Dedication to public agency having jurisdiction.
      (2)   Reservation of land for the use of property owners by deed or
covenants.
      (3)   Reservation for acquisition by a public agency within a period of
five years.  Such reservation shall be made in such a manner as to provide for
a release of the land to the subdivider in the event no public agency proceeds
with the purchase.
   (b)   Cultural Areas, Etc.  Due regard shall be given to the preservation of
outstanding cultural, historic or natural features such as scenic spots,
watercourses or exceptionally fine groves of trees.  Dedication to and
acceptance by a public agency is usually the best means of assuring their
preservation.
   (c)   Easement Along Streams.  Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located within the area being subdivided, the proper
authority shall provide a permanent easement of sufficient width dedicated to
the proper authority for the purpose of widening, deepening, relocating,
improving or protecting the stream for drainage or public use.
   (d)   Land Subject to Flooding or Containing Poor Drainage Facilities.  As a
safety measure for the protection of the health and welfare of the people of
the City, Council shall reserve the right to disapprove any subdivision which
is subject to periodic flooding, contains extremely poor drainage facilities or
has other physical impairment.  However, if the subdivider agrees to make such
improvements as will make the area completely safe for residential occupancy,
provided that in lieu of the improvements the subdivider shall furnish a surety
bond or a certified check covering the cost of the required improvements, the
subdivision may be approved, subject, however, to the approval of the
appropriate Board of Health, Conservancy District and the City Engineer.

      (1)   Prior to the granting of final approval the subdivider shall have
installed or shall have furnished a performance bond for the amount of 120
percent of the estimated construction cost of the ultimate installation of
improvements listed and described herein.  The performance bond or cash deposit
submitted to the City, will assure the City that the subdivider, his heirs,
successors and assigns, or agents or servants thereof, will comply with all
applicable terms, conditions, provisions and requirements of these Regulations
and will faithfully perform and complete the work of constructing and
installing such facilities or improvements in accordance with such laws and
Regulations.  Before this bond is accepted it shall be approved by the proper
administrative officials.  The term of this bond shall extend twelve months
beyond the completion date of the project.
      (2)   The subdivider or developer shall submit a set of construction
plans for the improvement of the road, street or alley, prepared by a
registered professional engineer.  The construction plans shall include the
title of the plan, typical sections, a plan and profile view, cross-sections,
miscellaneous engineering details and an estimate of quantities.  All typical
sections and major engineering details to be used on any particular road,
street or alley shall be approved in advance by the City Engineer or his
representative before completion of the plans.  When the subdivider or
developer submits for approval a construction plan for street improvements for
a part of a proposed subdivision area, preliminary street grades and proposed
drainage facilities for the entire subdivision area shall also be presented.
      (3)   When deemed desirable, the City Engineer or his representative may
require the construction of part or all of any intersecting roads, streets or
alleys in order to assure that no hardship or added expense is endured by
abutting property owners.
      (4)   All of the required improvements shall be made in full compliance
with the specifications for each of the various units of work as required by
the City Engineer according to the nature of the improvements.  Upon final
approval of the construction plans, two sets of the prints will be required for
the use of the City Engineering Department.
   (b)   Materials and Construction Procedure.
      (1)   Materials.  Unless otherwise indicated on the plans, with advance
approval of the City Engineer or his representative, materials shall meet the
requirements and shall be in accordance with the "Material Details" of the
current volume of "Construction and Material Specifications", State of Ohio,
Department of Transportation.  The materials will be referred to by material
grade or section number of the same current volume.
      (2)   Specifications, supervision and inspection.  The specifications of
the City shall in all respects govern all construction work.  The work shall be
done under City supervision and inspection.  It shall be completed within the
time fixed or agreed upon by the City Engineer.
      (3)   Inspection costs.  The cost of City inspection shall be paid by the
subdivider, and an amount of money estimated by the City Engineer for such
purpose shall be deposited in advance with the City or otherwise provided for
in the construction agreement and bond requirements as hereinafter mentioned.
      (4)   Recommendation and approval.  It shall be the responsibility of the
City Engineer to inform the person or persons making same, that whenever the
required improvements are properly made or otherwise secured as hereinafter
mentioned, the City Engineer will pass upon and recommend to the Planning
Commission that such plat, if otherwise conforming to these Regulations, be
approved.
1157.02  MONUMENTS.
   At the time of surveying and laying out a subdivision, the proprietor of
such subdivision shall plant at the corner of the public ground or lot, if
there is such, and if there is none, then at the corner of one of the inlots
and at the corner of each outlot, a good and sufficient stone, of such size and
dimensions and in such manner as the surveyor provided for under Ohio R.C.
711.01 directs, for a corner from which to make future surveys and the point at
which it may be found shall be designated on the plat.
   Such proprietor shall direct the surveyor to place and set at least four
permanent markers in each plat of ten lots or less.  In a subdivision having
more than ten lots, whether within or without the City, the proprietor shall
cause to be placed as many additional permanent markers as the surveyor deems
necessary to properly control his original survey.  Such permanent markers
shall be placed in a manner so that the line of sight between such markers can
be observed from one marker to the other.  Such markers shall be made of either
stone or concrete at least four inches in diameter, or four inches square, and
properly marked.  The markings on such markers shall consist of a cross cut
with the legs of the cross at least three inches long and at least one- eighth
inch deep.  Solid iron pins of at least one inch diameter may also be used as
permanent markers.  All stone, concrete or iron pin markers shall be at least
thirty inches long and the bottom of such markers shall be set at lest thirty
inches below finished grade.
   If the location for a permanent marker is originally determined to be in an
area of solid rock it may be relocated and offset from its original position. 
Such relocation must be noted on the plat.  These and all other markers shall
be designated on the plat before it is presented for record, but setting of
such markers shall not be required prior to completion of construction
necessary to the improvement of the land.
(ORC 711.03)
1157.03  UTILITY IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Water Supply.
      (1)   Public water supply.  Where public water supply is available as
determined by the Planning Commission, the subdivider or developer shall
construct a system of water mains and connect with such public water supply and
provide a connection for each lot.  All new streets shall be improved with six-
inch water lines, provided, however, that the Planning Commission in its
discretion may require larger lines where necessary or desirable, in which
case, the excess cost of the larger line shall be borne by the jurisdiction
having authority.
   Public water distribution systems.  Public wells and other public water
distribution systems shall meet the requirements of the State Department of
Health as cited in Ohio R.C. 3701.18 to 3701.21, inclusive, Title 37 "Health-
Safety-Morals".
      (2)   Individual private wells.
         A.   Evidence of water supply and well log.  Satisfactory evidence of
a safe potable underground water supply shall be submitted.  If such evidence
is not submitted a note to that effect shall be included on the final plat.  A
copy of the well log, which shall include the name and address of the well
driller, shall be submitted with the plat to the City Planning Commission.
         B.   Location and construction of individual private wells. 
Individual private wells shall be located at least twenty-five feet from
property lines; seventy-five feet from all septic tanks; approximately 100 feet
from all tile disposal fields and other sewage disposal facilities, ten feet
from all cast-iron sewer lines; thirty feet from any vitrified sewer tile
lines, and shall not be located within any flood plain unless the source is
above the flood plain and properly sealed.
As a precaution against seepage, an approved watertight seal shall be provided
around the pump mounting.
All abandoned wells shall be sealed in a manner that will render them
watertight as prescribed by the City Health Department.
In all cases where it has been determined that individual water supplies from
private wells are not feasible, a public water distribution system will be
required.
   (b)   Sewage Disposal.
      (1)   Sanitary sewers.  If a subdivision can be reasonably served by the
extension of an existing public sanitary sewer, as determined by the Planning
Commission, the subdivider or developer shall provide a system of sanitary
sewer mains and shall provide lateral connections for each lot.  Where a public
sanitary sewer is not reasonably accessible, the subdivider, the owner or the
developer may provide a package plant for the group, or septic tanks for each
lot, provided that such package plants or septic tanks are installed in
accordance with State and County or local Board of Health requirements. 
Whenever main lines are installed, sewer and water shall be extended to
property lines.  Connections to public sanitary sewer lines shall be subject to
the approval of and according to the specifications of the City Engineer. 
Eight-inch sewer lines will normally be required, but the Planning Commission
may at its discretion require larger liens where necessary or desirable, in
which case, the excess cost of the larger lines shall be borne by the
jurisdiction having authority.
   Group sewage disposal systems shall meet the requirements of the State
Department of Health as provided in Ohio R.C. 3701.18 to 3701.21, inclusive,
Title 37, "Health-Safety-Morals".
      (2)   Individual sewage disposal facilities.  In the event the
installation of individual disposal systems is considered, the absorption
ability of the soil, surface drainage and topography shall be the criteria for
determining whether or not the installation of individual septic tank disposal
systems is permissible.  At least one percolation test shall be made for each
lot area being platted, and each test shall be located in close proximity to
the proposed sewage disposal unit, be numbered and its location shown on the
plat.  Tests shall be made by a recognized authority.
   The general types of soil encountered in making the tests and the depth of
ground water, if found, shall be documented and submitted with the plat
together with the actual percolation time of each test hole and the name and
address of the registered engineer, registered surveyor or other person
acceptable by the County Health Department making the test and the dates on
which they were made.
      (3)   Percolation tests.  All percolation tests shall be performed in
accordance with the requirements of the appropriate Board of Health.  The
method of making such tests shall be as follows:
         A.   Dig or bore holes approximately six to ten inches wide, with
straight sides to a minimum depth of thirty inches or a maximum depth of forty-
eight inches.
         B.   Keep filling holes with water until the ground becomes soaked and
allow all water to seep away.  Then fill the holes with water to a depth of
twelve inches.
         C.   Record the time, in minutes, required for the last six inches of
water to seep away.  Divide the time by six to obtain the average time for
water to fall one inch.
         D.   Size of tile disposal fields:
 
Average Time Required for Water to Fall Type of  Lineal Feet of Tile Required
One Inch as Shown by Percolation Test   Leaching 2 or less 3 to 4   5 to 6

India or equal quality ink, a plan and profile showing proposed street and road
grades and drainage structures.
   (a)   Width of Pavement.  The width of pavement will vary, depending upon
the character of the development served and the amount of traffic expected to
utilize the street.  The following are the minimum street pavement widths:
 
Type of Street                          Width of Pavement
                                        To conform to applicable cross-sections
Major streets and highways              of the Official Highway Plan, as
                                        determined by the City Planning
                                        Commission and the City Engineer.
Collector streets                       36 feet
Local streets serving medium-high
density development (eight families or  36 feet
more per net acre)
 
Local streets serving medium density
development (four to seven families     30 feet
per net acre)
Local streets serving low density
suburban development (three families or 20 feet
less per net acre)
Alleys                                  16 feet
 
In certain instances, especially where a commercial area is involved and no
off- street parking facilities are provided and no parking is permitted on the
street at any time, a parking lane at least eight feet wide on each side of the
street and paved to the satisfaction of and in accordance with the
specifications approved by the City Engineer may be required in addition to the
necessary number of lanes for moving traffic.  Where pavement widths greater
than those specified above are necessary, provision of same shall be discussed
with the public officials having jurisdiction over the planning and
construction of public ways to determine whether or not public expenditures for
such additional width can or should be made simultaneously with the
subdivider's improvement program.
   (b)   Subgrade.  The subgrade shall be free of sod, vegetation matter or
other similar material.  Where poor subsurface drainage conditions exist,
adequate drainage shall be installed.  The subgrade shall be rolled with a
roller of not less than seven tons in weight.  Sub-base grade tolerance shall
be not more than one inch in sixteen feet.  Sub-base construction shall be
subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
   (c)   Residential Local and Collector Streets.  These streets shall be
constructed in accordance with subsection (c)(1) or (2) hereof, except in
unusual circumstances which are based on the decision of the City Engineer as
specified in subsection (c)(3) hereof.

where he deems unusual sub-base conditions make it necessary, or to permit
lower standards where excellent natural sub-base conditions exist.
   (e)   Curbs and Gutters.  The requirement of curbs or curbs and gutters will
vary in accordance with the character of the area and the density of
development involved.  In urban or suburban areas curbs are necessary to
control storm water runoff and to clearly define driving and parking areas.
      (1)   Curbs shall be required on all streets designed to serve areas
where the existing or anticipated net residential density of the proposed
subdivision equals or exceeds three families per net acre.
      (2)   In commercial developments, or where other similar intensive urban
uses exist or are anticipated, curbs shall ordinarily be required.  The
installation of curbs may be required on major or minor highways if such
construction is deemed necessary for public safety.
      (3)   Where curbs exist on abutting properties, their extension will
ordinarily be required throughout the proposed subdivision.
      (4)   Where curbs are not required, adequate gutters shall be graded and
protected by seeding or appropriate surfacing.
      (5)   Curbs may be of the wall type or may be combined with gutters built
of concrete.  Curbs, combined curbs and gutters and graded gutters shall be
constructed in conformance with the current volume of "Construction and
Material Specifications" of the Department of Transportation, State of Ohio, as
they pertain to this type of improvement.

intersecting roads, drives, lanes or property entrances and at other locations
where required.
1157.05  DRAINAGE.
   A drainage system adequate to serve the needs of the proposed new streets
and the entire subdivision will be required in the new subdivisions.  Where an
adequate public storm sewer main is available at the plat boundary, the
subdivider shall construct a storm sewer system and connect it with such storm
sewer main.  If such storm sewer systems are not accessible, adequate storm
water drainage shall be provided by natural drainage channels with easements of
adequate width as approved by the City Engineer.  A drainage plan shall be
submitted simultaneously with the plat of any subdivision, showing the proposed
scheme of surface drainage.
   (a)   Standards and Specifications for Drainage Facilities.  The
construction of storm water drainage improvements shall be subject to the
approval of the City Engineer. 
      (1)   The drainage ditch must have at least a one percent grade, or
otherwise approved.
      (2)   If the roadway ditch is in excess of four percent, an approved type
gutter using concrete, stone, sod or underground drainage must be used, with

designs are necessary, such as masonry or concrete structures, etc., such
designs in detail must be submitted to the City Engineer Department for
approval in advance of the completion of the construction plans.  The driveway
culverts shall be laid so as to maintain the flow line of the ditch or gutter. 
Head walls may be required.
1157.06  SIDEWALKS.
   Portland cement concrete sidewalks having a minimum width of four feet and
having a minimum thickness of four inches shall be installed on both sides of
all new streets, provided, however, that the Planning Commission may waive this
requirement and allow sidewalks along only one side of any new street where in
its sole and absolute discretion it determines that sidewalks on both sides of
such new street are not necessary.  Beyond the corporation limits, in areas
where the predominant lot width is 100 feet or more, the Planning Commission at
its discretion may waive the requirement for any sidewalks.
1157.07  STREET NAME SIGNS.

completed prior to such approval, or
   (b)   The subdivider files with Council a surety bond or cashier's or
certified check for the amount of 120 percent of the estimated construction
cost which shall be approved by the City Engineer, guaranteeing to the City
that such improvements will be constructed and completed in a satisfactory
manner and within a period specified by the City Engineer, and such guarantee
shall extend one year beyond completion.  Such bond or checks shall be approved
by the Law Director and shall be made payable to and enforceable by the City of
East Liverpool, Ohio.  Upon satisfactory completion of the improvements and
approval of the same in writing by the City Engineer and with the presentation
of letters of certification of payment in full of all contractors,
subcontractors, suppliers of materials, engineers, surveyors and all inspection
fees or other fees incurred by the installation of the improvements by the
subdivider, the bonds may be released in writing by Council and may be returned
to the developer.
1157.11  PROVISIONS FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION.
   Where the subdivision contains sewers, sewage treatment plants, water supply
systems, park areas, street trees or other physical facilities necessary or
desirable for the welfare of the area and which are of common use or benefit

1185.11  ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   A certificate of appropriateness shall be obtained from the Review

the same or related factors in other properties, sites and areas in the
immediate vicinity; and the enhancement of the community's economic enhancement
through the protection of property values.

with their surroundings.

and design review established by the Review Board pursuant to the terms of this
chapter.  Guidelines shall promote the conservation, development and use of
properties, sites and districts within the City and shall seek to preserve the
special historic architectural, community or aesthetic integrity of the
landmark or district.  Guidelines shall guide applicants in making submittals
and the Review Board in making its determination as to the appropriateness of
the proposed change.
   (e)   The Review Board shall consider the advice of those consultants whose
opinion is sought by the Review Board with respect to any application for a

1185.13  DEMOLITION.
   (a)   No person shall demolish any structure or exterior architectural
feature until there has been filed with the Review Board an application for a
certificate of appropriateness setting forth the intent to demolish such
structure or exterior architectural feature together with a written statement
that such structure or exterior architectural feature is not historically or
architecturally significant or otherwise worthy of preservation.  Upon
determination by the Review Board that such property or exterior architectural
feature is not historically or architecturally significant or otherwise worthy
of preservation, due to projected development of the community, a certificate
of appropriateness shall be issued.  The applicant shall then apply for a
permit to demolish the structure or exterior architectural feature.
   (b)   If the necessary demolition is questionable, the Review Board may
delay determination of the application for a period of 180 days upon a finding
that the structure is of such importance that alternatives to demolition may be
feasible and should be actively pursued by both the applicant and the Review
Board.  In the event that action on an application is delayed as provided
herein, the Review Board may take such steps as it deems necessary to preserve
the property concerned, in accordance with the purposes of this chapter.  Such
steps may include but shall not be limited to, certification of a registered
professional engineer that the structure of a building is unsound or would need
major reinforcement to be brought under Building Code structural requirements,
considering a use that the building would reasonably lend itself to;
consultation with civic groups, public agencies and interested residents;
recommendations for acquisition of property by public or private bodies or
agencies; and exploration of the possibility to move one or more structures or
other features.
(Ord. 19, 1989.  Passed 4-3-89.)
1185.14  MINIMUM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT.
   (a)   The owner of an historic structure or any structure within an historic
district shall provide sufficient maintenance and upkeep for such structure to
ensure its perpetuation and to prevent its destruction by deterioration.
(Ord. 53, 1993.  Passed 10-4-93.)
   (b)   The provisions of subsection (a) hereof shall be in addition to all
other applicable provisions of the State Building Code.
   (c)   The Historic Conservation Board, on its own initiative, may file a
petition with the Law Director of the City requesting that the Director proceed
to take action against any owner which in the opinion of the Board is in
violation of subsection (a) hereof.
(Ord. 7, 1990.  Passed 2-5-90.)
1185.15  EXCLUSIONS.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any property, within a preservation district or
landmark under the provisions of this chapter, provided such work involves no
change in material, design, texture, color or outer appearance; nor shall
anything in this chapter be construed to prevent any change, including the
construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any building or
feature which the Chief Building Inspector has designated as an unsafe building
or feature pursuant to Part 13 of the Codified Ordinances as required for
public safety being an unsafe or dangerous condition.
(Ord. 19, 1989.  Passed 4-3-89.)
1185.99  PENALTY.
   (a)   Whoever constructs, reconstructs or alters any exterior architectural
feature now or hereafter in the historic district in violation of this chapter
shall be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than five thousand

1319.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Statutory Authorization City of East Liverpool.  Article XVIII,
Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority
to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the health, safety, and
general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of East
Liverpool, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City of East Liverpool has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)    Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)    Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)    Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)    Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)    Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)    Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
      (4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)    Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
East Liverpool as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any 
additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City of East Liverpool.
   (f)    Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are  adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Columbiana County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas dated April 5, 2006. Flood Insurance Rate Map Columbiana County, Ohio and
Incorporated Areas dated April 5, 2006.
      (2)    Other studies and/or maps which may be relied upon for
establishment of  the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard
include:
         None at this time.
      (3)    Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of East Liverpool as required by Section
1319.04 (c), Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Planning Department, 126 West Sixth Street, East
Liverpool, Ohio 43920.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of East Liverpool, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.  (Ord. 12,
2006.  Passed 1-17-06.)
1319.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
Accessory Structure.  A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
Appeal.   A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's interpretation
of any provision of these regulations or a request for a variance.
Base Flood.  The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.  The base flood may also be referred to as the one
percent (1%) chance annual flood or one-hundred
(100) year flood.
Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE).  The water surface elevation of the base
flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic Vertical
Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and usually
expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO  areas, the base flood
elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to 3
feet).
Basement.  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
Development.  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor.  See "Lowest Floor."
Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).  Issued by President Carter in
1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted in
or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas, unless
there is no practicable alternative.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The agency with the overall
responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
Fill.  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
Flood or Flooding.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from:
   (1)    The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
   (2)    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).  Usually the initial map, produced by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard areas.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
Flood Insurance Risk Zones.  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that indicate
the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community. Following
are the zone definitions:
   Zone A:     Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base
flood elevations are not determined.
   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard  areas inundated by the 100-
year flood;  base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone AO:   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average
depths are determined.
   Zone AH:   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are
determined.
   Zone A99:    Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to 
be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood
         with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage
area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base
flood.
   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
Flood Insurance Study (FIS).  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
Flood Protection Elevation.  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the
base flood elevation plus 2.0 (two) feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
Floodway.  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas
that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge. A floodway
is typically determined through a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis
such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of the base
flood discharge is no more than a designated height. In no case shall the
designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community.
   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
Freeboard.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for the purposes of
floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown
factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
Historic structure.  Any structure that is:
   (1)    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
   (2)    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
   (3)    Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation office.
Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering  analysis.  An analysis performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA
determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMC's are
broken down into the following categories:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data showing
that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard
area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data that,
usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations,
floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type
of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel
has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore,
excluded from the special flood hazard area.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and comment by
FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum National Flood
Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or
revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps,
or Flood Insurance Studies.
Lowest floor.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
Manufactured home.  A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected  to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Manufactured home park.  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code 3701-27-
01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three or more
manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for
revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or
enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
New construction.  Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced
on or after the initial effective date of the City of East Liverpool Flood
Insurance Rate Map, July 18, 1983 and includes any subsequent improvements to
such structures.
Person.  Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C. 111.15
as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited to,
any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's Department, or
any court.
Recreational vehicle.  A vehicle which is:
   (1)    Built on a single chassis,
   (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
   (3)    Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light duty
truck, and
   (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage in the
practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01 to 4703.19 of
the Ohio Revised Code.
Registered Professional Engineer.  A person registered as a professional
engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Registered Professional Surveyor.  A person registered as a professional
surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Special Flood Hazard Area.  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it
is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance
of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a  substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground.
Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
   (1)    Any improvement to a structure which is considered "new
construction,"
   (2)    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state  or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
   (3)    Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
Variance.  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations consistent
with the variance conditions herein.
Violation.  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.  (Ord. 12, 2006.  Passed 1-17-06.)
1319.03  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.  The Director of Planning

   (j)    Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of East Liverpool flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1319.01 (f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)    Requirement to submit new technical data. 
         A.    For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include: 
            1.    Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.    Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special
flood hazard area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.    Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring
the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1319.04 (c).
         B.    It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical
data, required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a
format required for a  Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map
Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map
revisions shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.    The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.    Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.    Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.    Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
hereof.
      (2)    Right to submit new technical data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of East Liverpool, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)    Annexation/detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of East Liverpool have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of East Liverpool's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
East Liverpool boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of
the City of East Liverpool suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the City of East Liverpool has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)    Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)    In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)    When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.    Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the
FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all
previously existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of
administering these regulations.
         B.    Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by
FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no
base flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary
base flood elevations or floodway areas exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)    The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1319.05 , Appeals and Variances.
      (5)    Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)    Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain  Administrator shall:
      (1)    Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)    Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)    Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)    Development in floodways.
         A.    In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.    Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base
flood  elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed
by the applicant:
            1.    Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.    Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.    An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.    Section
1319.04 (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. to 5.
      (3)    Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.    The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.    Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such 
notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.    The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of East Liverpool specifying the maintenance responsibilities.  If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.    The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1319.03 (j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
            (Ord. 12, 2006.  Passed 1-17-06.)
1319.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)    The Council shall appoint an Appeals Board consisting of three 
members. The members shall serve four 4-year terms after which time they shall
be reappointed or replaced by the Council. Each member shall serve until his/
her successor is appointed.
      (2)    A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals
Board.
   Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at
the call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasijudicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the Planning Department.
   (b)    Powers and Duties.
      (1)    The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination
made by the  Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of
these  regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the  Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the  matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within 30 (thirty) days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief  statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by
the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.  Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties
in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance.
         A.    Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.    Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)    Notice for public hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general  circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)    Public hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires.
         A.   In considering such variance applications, the Appeals Board
shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other sections of these regulations and the
following factors:
            1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others.
            2.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these  regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it
deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations. 
      (4)    Other conditions for variances.
         A.    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)    Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)    A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)    The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and
testimony in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)    The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)    All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)    Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)    The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)    The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Columbiana County Court of Common Pleas,
as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 12, 2006.  Passed 1-17-06.)
1319.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.

1337A.01  RENTAL PERMIT REQUIRED.
   All residential property within the City occupied by a party other than the
owner as listed in the deed records of Columbiana County, Ohio, including
boarding or rooming houses, (long term) rentals in motels, hotels, and bed and
breakfast establishments shall require the issuance of a rental housing permit
from the Housing Inspector.  Traditional motels, hotels and bed and breakfast
establishments in compliance with the City Zoning Code are excluded from the
necessity of obtaining a rental housing permit.
(Ord. 58, 2006.  Passed 11-6-06.)
1337A.02  APPLICATION.
   To obtain a rental housing permit, the owner of property occupied by a party
other than the owner shall apply to the office of the Housing Inspector. 
Property owners are required to make application for a rental housing permit
within thirty days after the effective date of this code, or upon the
expiration of an existing rental license.  The Planning Department shall
maintain application and inspection forms and require the submission of such
information as deemed necessary to properly administer and implement the
provisions of this code.  A rental housing permit shall be issued by the
Housing Inspector if, upon inspection of the property, it is determined that
the property meets the requirements of applicable City codes.
(Ord. 58, 2006.  Passed 11-6-06.)
1337A.03  INSPECTION.
   As soon as practicable after receiving an application for a rental housing
permit, the Housing Inspector shall cause an inspection of the property to be
made.  Upon application for a rental housing permit, the property owner may
rent or lease the premises at his or her own risk, subject to subsequent
approval by the Housing Inspector.  The property owner or agent shall provide
the Housing Inspector with full and complete access to the premises provided
the Housing Inspector has given the owner/agent forty-eight hours advance
notice.  In the event the premises is occupied by a tenant, the property owner
or agent shall provide the tenant with notice of the inspection at least
twenty-four hours in advance of such inspection.  After inspection, the Housing
Inspector shall notify the property owner of approval of the application for a
rental housing permit, or if approval of the application is denied, of what
City code violations must be corrected.  The property owner shall correct the
violations within thirty days of the date of the notice, and notify the Housing
Inspector when the violations have been corrected so that he may cause a re-
inspection to be made.  Notice to owner/agent and tenants in advance of the re-
inspection shall be provided in the same manner notice of the original
inspection was provided.  The Housing Inspector shall deny issuance of a rental
housing permit to any owner whose property does not comply with this code. 
Where the Housing Inspector determines progress is being made toward the
completion of the correction of code violations and the property owner requests
additional time to make repairs, the Housing Inspector may grant an extension
of time as he may determine reasonable and necessary to complete the required
work.  It shall be unlawful for any property owner or agent to fail to provide
the Housing Inspector with access to the premises to complete  an inspection or
reinspection, or for residential property to be occupied by a party other than
the owner unless an application for a rental housing permit has been made and a
permit issued.  Any rental housing permit issued under the terms of this code
may be suspended or revoked at any time by the Housing Inspector upon
satisfactory proof of a violation of any provision of applicable City codes
which would have been grounds for denial of an original application for a
permit.

1339.01  CREATION OF BOARD.
   There is hereby created a Board of Housing Appeals of five members to
conduct hearings authorized by this Housing Code.  Members shall be appointed
by the Mayor with approval of Council for overlapping terms of three years. 
Two of the first members shall be appointed for one year, two members for two
years and one member for three years respectively, and they shall serve until a
successor is appointed.  To be eligible for appointment to such Board, a person
shall be a citizen of the United States and a resident of the City.
1339.02  RULES OF PROCEDURE AND INTERPRETATION.
   (a)   The Board shall adopt rules of procedure not inconsistent with this
Housing Code and elect officers as the Board sees fit.  No member of the Board
shall take part in any hearing or determination in which he has a personal or
financial interest.  Three members of the Board in attendance at any meeting
shall constitute a quorum.
   (b)   The Board shall interpret the intent of this Housing Code, in specific
causes, where upon appeal, it clearly appears that, by reason of special
conditions, undue hardship would result from a literal application of any
section of the Housing Code.  Where such undue hardship is clearly
demonstrated, the Board may permit a variance from the applicable section if
the dwelling will vary only a reasonable minimum from the literal provision of
the Housing Code, but will comply with the spirit and intent of the Housing
Code, with respect to sanitation, safety and rehabilitation.  All decisions to
permit a variance under this section shall be by a majority vote of the total
membership of the Board.
1339.03  HEARINGS.
   (a)   Any person affected by any notice which has been issued in connection
with the enforcement of any provision of this Housing Code may request and
shall be granted a hearing on the matter before the Board, provided that such
person shall file in the Office of Housing Inspection a written petition
requesting such hearing and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds
therefor within ten days after the day the notice was served.
   (b)   Upon receipt of such petition the Housing Inspector shall set a time
and place for such hearing and shall give the petitioner written notice
thereof.  At such hearing the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be
heard and to show why such notice should be modified or withdrawn.  The hearing
shall be commenced not later than thirty days after the day on which the
petition was filed.  However, upon application of the petitioner,the Housing
Inspector may postpone the date of the hearing for a reasonable time beyond
such thirty-day period, if in his judgment the petitioner has submitted a good
and sufficient reason for such postponement.  After such hearing the Board
shall sustain, modify or withdraw the notice, depending upon its finding as to
whether the provisions of this Housing Code have been complied with.  If the
Board sustains or modifies such notice, it shall be deemed to be an order.  Any
notice served pursuant to Section
1337.04(e) shall automatically become an order if a written petition for a
hearing is not filed in the Office of the Housing Inspector within ten days
after such notice is served.  After a hearing in the case of any notice
suspending any permit required by this Housing Code when such notice has been
sustained by the Board, the permit shall be deemed to have been revoked.  Any
such permit which has been suspended by a notice shall be deemed to be
automatically revoked if a petition for hearing is not filed in the Office of
the Housing Inspector within ten days after such notice is served.  The
proceedings at such hearing, including the findings and the decision of the
Board, shall be summarized, reduced to writing, and entered as a matter of
public record in the Office of Housing Inspection.  Such record shall also
include a copy of every notice or order issued in connection with the matter. 
Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board may seek relief therefrom in
any court of competent jurisdiction as provided by the laws of the State.
