OF MIDDLEFIELD, OHIO; TO REPEAL ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH
THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER THEREIN; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Middlefield, Ohio, has had the matter
of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Council of the Village of Middlefield
as follows:
   Section 1. That the ordinances of the Village of Middlefield, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated

hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Middlefield,
Ohio.
   Section 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to August 5, 1979, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

123.01 of the Codified Ordinances. All sections of the Codified Ordinances
without a previous ordinance or resolution history at the end thereof indicate
the sections contain new material ordained by this adopting ordinance.
   Section 4. That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the Village, the reason for the necessity being
that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
Village, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation and avoid

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.

   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

   (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history;
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

member of Council making the motion or, if requested by the Chair, by the Law
Director. Any member may demand that it be reduced to writing. A motion shall
not be withdrawn by the mover without the consent of the person who seconded
the motion. Unless otherwise required by law a motion shall be deemed passed if
it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the members present,
including the Chair if entitled to vote thereon.
   (b)   Order of Precedence. When a question is before Council, no motion
shall be entertained except the following:
      (1)   To adjourn.
      (2)   To lay on the table.
      (3)   The previous question.
      (4)   To postpone to a time certain.
      (5)   To refer.
      (6)   To amend.
      (7)   To postpone indefinitely.
   Such motions shall have precedence in the foregoing order.
   (c)   Motion to Adjourn. Motion to adjourn shall be in order at any time,
except as follows:
      (1)   When repeated without intervening business of discussion.
      (2)   When made while another member is speaking.
      (3)   When the previous question has been ordered.
      (4)   While a vote is being taken.
   A motion to adjourn is not debatable, except as to the time to which the
meeting is adjourned.
   (d)   Motion to Lay on Table. A motion to lay on the table shall preclude
all amendments or debate of the subject under consideration. If the motion
prevails, the consideration of the subject may be resumed only upon motion of a
member voting with the majority and with the consent of the majority of the
members present.
   (e)   Previous Question. The previous question shall be stated in these
words: “Shall debate now close?” The motion shall pass if two-thirds of the

further amendments or debate, and such question shall be put immediately.

indefinitely is carried, the principal question shall be lost.

amendment. An amendment once rejected may not be moved again in the same form.
If Council consents, and if both the member who made the motion and the member
who seconded the motion agree, a motion can be amended consistent with the
debate before Council without a roll call vote. In addition, to facilitate
refinement of motions, a motion may be withdrawn informally if both the member
making the motion and the member who seconded the motion consent.
   (h)   Motion to Suspend Rules. A motion to suspend the rule which requires
three readings on three separate days must receive the affirmative vote of
three-quarters of the members elected or appointed to Council and shall be
debatable. Upon the passage of such motion, the main question shall be open to
debate. All other rules may be suspended by a majority of members of Council
present without debate.
   (i)   Motion to Reconsider. A motion to reconsider a proposal that has been
acted upon favorably, must be made before adjournment of the session of Council
at which the vote was taken. A motion to reconsider any other action taken by
Council may be made not later than the next regular meeting after the vote of
Council thereon. In either case, such motion may be made only by a member who
voted with the prevailing side. The concurrence of a majority of the members
present shall be sufficient for reconsideration of a vote. If a motion to
reconsider is lost, it shall not be entertained again.
   (j)   Executive Sessions. Any motion to adjourn to executive session of
Council, shall state the exact purpose and nature of the business to be
discussed. No business other than that which is included in the motion shall be
discussed or acted upon. If the subject is Village personnel, then the
appropriate department head must be present at this session. If Council desires
additional persons to be in attendance during this session, their relationship
to the business discussed must be stated for the record prior to adjournment.

ability and pecuniary resources to fulfill the conditions of the contract.
   (b)   No contract will be awarded to any person who is in arrears to the
Municipality upon any debt or contract, or who is in default, as surety or

   The bidder is required to examine carefully the site of the work, the
proposal form, the plans and specifications and all contract documents for the

has investigated and is acquainted with the conditions to be encountered for
performing the work, including the character, quality and quantities of work to
be performed and materials to be furnished, the prevailing hourly wage rates
for the area as prescribed by law and all requirements of the contract
documents. Submission of a proposal shall be considered prima-facie evidence
that the bidder has made such examination and is satisfied as to all conditions
which will affect the work.
(Ord. 05-109. Passed 4-21-05.)
151.15 WITHDRAWAL OF BIDS.
   (a)   A bidder may withdraw his or her proposal provided his or her written
request for such withdrawal is delivered to the Village Administrator, or his

the official who will open the proposals prior to the time and date set for
such opening.
   (c)   The Municipality expressly reserves the right to increase or diminish
the quantities of work and/or omit altogether any items shown on the proposal
form, as the Village Engineer may deem advisable and/or necessary without

151.16 OPENING AND CONSIDERATION OF BIDS; REJECTION OF BIDS.
   Proposals will be received until the hour and date set for the opening
thereof and must be in the hands of the Village Administrator, or his or her

totals will be compared and the results of such comparison will be made public.
Until the final award of a contract, the Municipality reserves the right to
reject any or all proposals, or any part of any proposal, and to waive any
technical errors or informalities in the bidding as such waiver may be deemed
to be in the best interests of the Municipality.
(Ord. 05-109. Passed 4-21-05.)
151.17 AWARD OF CONTRACT.
   (a)   The award of the contract, if it is awarded, will be to the lowest and
best bidder whose proposal complies with all the requirements prescribed. The
Municipality reserves the right to consider all elements entering into the
question of determining the qualifications and responsibility of any bidder.
The Municipality may accept a proposal and award a contract which is greater or
less in any amount than the Village Engineer's estimate. Where bids are taken
in the form of separate proposals on portions of one project, the work will
ordinarily be awarded to the contractor, otherwise qualified, whose combined
bid is the lowest. No bidder bidding on all such proposals shall be required to
enter into a contract covering less than the entire project without that
bidder's consent.
   (b)   The award, if made, will be made within sixty days after opening the
proposals, unless the time for awarding and executing the contract is extended
by mutual consent of the Municipality and the bidder whose proposal the
Municipality accepts. No increase shall be made in the contract price for any
damages, costs or expenses incurred by the bidder as a result of such extension
unless such increase is specifically approved in writing by the Municipality as
a change order to the contract. In no case will a contract award be made until
the certification of funds by the Village Fiscal Officer and all necessary
investigations are made as to the responsibility of the bidder to whom it is
proposed to award the contract.
(Ord. 05-109. Passed 4-21-05.)
151.18  PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (a)   Within ten days after receiving notice of an award and before entering
into a contract, the successful bidder will be required to furnish a
performance bond to the Municipality in the full amount of the contract, which
binds the surety whether or not it receives notice of the award of the
contract, the condition of which bond shall be the full and complete execution
and performance of all of the terms contained in the contract documents.
   (b)   The bond shall be subject to the approval of the Municipality as to
sufficiency and form, and the company issuing the performance bond and the
sureties thereof must be duly authorized and qualified to do business in the
State and must, upon request of the Law Director, furnish a certificate of
authority and compliance from the office of the State Superintendent of
Insurance.
   (c)   Such bond shall not be released until all provisions of the contract
have been fulfilled. (Ord. 05-109. Passed 4-21-05.)
151.19 EXECUTION OF CONTRACT; FAILURE TO EXECUTE CONTRACT.
   (a)   The contract shall be properly signed by the successful bidder and
returned, together with the performance bond. If the contract is awarded to an
out-of-state corporation, the signed contract must be accompanied by a
certificate issued by the Secretary of State certifying that such corporation
is authorized to do business in Ohio. The contract, the performance bond and,
in the case of out-of-state corporations, the certificate must be returned to
the Municipality within ten days after the bidder has received notice that the
contract has been awarded unless such ten day period is enlarged in writing at
the sole option of the Municipality. No award shall be considered binding upon
the Municipality until the execution of the contract. A contract shall be
deemed executed when it is signed by the bidder and, on behalf of the
Municipality, by the Village Administrator, when it is certified by the Village
Fiscal Officer as required by law, when it is secured by the required
performance bond and when it is approved as to legal form by the Law Director.
The successful bidder, upon his or her request, shall be entitled to a notice
to proceed as soon as the contract is executed and shall be ready to proceed as
soon as instructed to do so by the Municipality.
   (b)   Failure to execute a contract and file an acceptable performance bond
and affidavit within the time and as provided in this Chapter shall be cause
for annulment of the award and the forfeiture of the proposal guaranty to the
Municipality, not as a penalty but as liquidated damages. The contract may then
be awarded to the next lowest bidder or the work may be re-advertised, at the
discretion of the Municipality.
(Ord. 05-109. Passed 4-21-05.)
151.20  CONTRACT CONDITIONS.
   Every contract shall be deemed to contain the conditions set forth in this
Chapter, all provisions required by Ohio law and such other provisions, terms
and conditions as the Law Director and the Village Engineer deem necessary or
appropriate.

by the contract, from claims for damages for personal injury, including

all of the contractor's employees employed at the site of the project and, in
case any work is sublet, the contractor shall require the subcontractor
similarly to provide workers' compensation insurance for all employees of all
subcontractors working within the Municipality unless such employees are
covered by the protection afforded by the contractor.
   (b)   Such insurance shall be evidenced by a certificate from the Industrial
Commission of Ohio that the contractor has complied with each and every
condition of the Act of February 26, 1913, as amended and supplemented, known
as the Workers' Compensation Law. The contractor shall save the Municipality
harmless from any liability arising from or under the Workers' Compensation
Law.

all services performed under the contract and shall agree to accept full and

contributions, taxes or liability therefor. (Ord. 05-109. Passed 4-21-05.)

prevailing wage as determined by the State Department of Industrial Relations,
Division of Building and Factory Inspection.
(Ord. 05-109. Passed 4-21-05.)
 
151.25  LABOR AND MATERIAL SUPPLIERS.
   The contractor shall promptly pay or satisfy the just and equitable claims
of all persons who have performed labor or furnished material for the
contractor in the execution of the contract, including those who have
previously filed attested accounts of such claims with the Municipality, and
all bills, costs or claims of whatever kind which might in law or equity become
a lien upon the work or against the fund from which the same is to be paid or a
charge against the Municipality. The contractor shall indemnify and hold the
Municipality harmless from any cost, claim, liability or expense arising from
any claim against the Municipality or against any fund of the Municipality.
(Ord. 05-109. Passed 4-21-05.)

subcontractor. The contractor shall promptly, upon request of the Municipality,
file a conformed copy of any subcontract with prices and terms of payment

contractor and subcontractor shall jointly and severally agree that no

151.29  TERMS OF PAYMENT.
   (a)    Monthly Estimates. During the progress of the contract work, the
contractor shall prepare monthly estimates based upon the amount of acceptable
work done and in place and upon acceptable material delivered to the site in
reasonable amounts and in proper condition, which estimates shall be reviewed
by the Village Engineer. If said estimates are correct and accurate, the
Village Engineer shall forward the estimates to Council for its approval. If
the Council approves the estimate the Municipality shall, pay the contractor
ninety percent (90%) of the total value of acceptable work in place, less
former payments, provided the same is free from any attested accounts, or from
any claims for damages which might in any manner become a liability or charge
against the Municipality, and provided no legal restraints are placed upon the
Municipality preventing such payment. The retainage shall be held exclusively
by the Municipality and no escrow accounts will be authorized or required. The
allowance and payment of such estimates shall not be deemed a final acceptance
by the Municipality of the work or material therein included.
   (b)   Final Estimate. The Engineer shall, as soon as practical after the
completion of the entire work by the contractor, make a complete and final
estimate of the work and accept or reject the same, and shall submit said
estimate to Council for its approval. Within sixty days after written final
acceptance of the work by the Council, the Municipality shall pay to the
contractor the whole amount of the money then due the contractor under the
contract, less the amount to be retained as a guaranty and less any sums which
may have been expended by the Municipality under the provisions of the
contract, provided the same is free from any attested accounts or from any
claims for damages which might in any manner become a liability or charge
against the Municipality and provided no legal restraints are placed upon the
Municipality preventing such payment.
      (1)   Acceptance by the contractor of such final estimate shall
constitute a release to the Municipality, and all of its officers or agents,
from all claims of, and liability to, the contractor for any reason whatsoever
except claims for final payment of the guaranty fund.
      (2)   All prior partial estimates shall be subject to correction in the
final estimate, and the final estimate shall be subject to correction before
release and payment of the guaranty fund.
      (3)   Neither the acceptance of any work by the Municipality, nor the
issuance of the final estimate, nor the payment upon such estimate nor the
making of any special repairs by the Municipality, shall in any way be held or
construed as relieving the contractor and his or her surety from full
compliance with all requirements of the contract and guaranty.
         (Ord. 05-109. Passed 4-21-05.)
151.30 GUARANTY OF MATERIALS AND WORKMANSHIP; FINAL PAYMENT.
   (a)    The contractor shall guarantee all materials and workmanship
furnished and used in the improvement for a period of at least two years. Prior
to releasing the performance bond, the contractor shall provide a maintenance
bond to Council in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the total cost of the
contract, unless, for good cause, a greater or lesser amount is recommended by
the Engineer and approved by the Council.
   (b)    If the contractor fails to perform the maintenance as required by the
guaranty, Council will authorize the Village Engineer to have the work
performed. The cost of this work will be deducted from the maintenance bond.
The contractor will be held liable for any expenditures in excess of the
maintenance bond.
   (c)    After all maintenance work has been completed to the satisfaction of
the Engineer, and after the expiration of the two-year guaranty period, Council
will return the maintenance bond or that portion remaining to the contractor.

taxable income" as if the pass-through entity was a "C" corporation. This
definition does not apply to any taxpayer required to file a return under Ohio
Revised Code Section 5745.03 or to the net profit from a sole proprietorship.
This definition is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1,

organized under the laws of the United States, Ohio or any other state,
territory or foreign country or dependency
   (h)    "Employee" means anyone who works for wages, salary, commissions or

   (a)    In the taxation of income which is subject to Village income taxes if
the taxpayer shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net
profit is attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted
within the boundaries of the Village, then only such portion shall be
considered as having a taxable situs in the Village for the purposes of
municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer
to be allocated as having been derived from within the Village, shall be

   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll, and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight as follows:

property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the

tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated:

rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.

services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed;

another basis may be used as a substitute method under uniform regulations so
as to produce such a result. If books and records are used, the following shall
apply:
   The net profits allocable to the Village from business, professional or
other activities conducted in the Village by corporations or unincorporated
entities (whether resident or non-resident) may be determined from the records
of the taxpayer only if the taxpayer has bona fide records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy what portion of his net profits is attributable to that
part of his activities conducted within the Village.
   If the books and records of the taxpayer are used as the basis for
apportioning net profits, a statement must accompany the return explaining the
manner in which such apportionment is made in sufficient detail to enable the
administrator to determine whether the net profits attributable to the Village
are apportioned with reasonable accuracy.
   In determining the income allocable to the Village from the books and
records of a taxpayer, an adjustment may be made for the contribution made to
the production of such income by headquarters activities of the taxpayer,
whether such headquarters is within or without the Village.

required of any employee whose sole income, subject to the tax or taxes under

   Under such regulations as the Administrator may prescribe, subject to the
approval of the Board of Review, any taxpayer, in lieu of filing a detailed
return as provided herein, may file a sworn statement prescribed by the
Administrator, of salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation of
qualified wages or of net profits as reported on his federal income tax return

made under the terms of any municipal income tax ordinance and the taxpayer
filing such sworn statement shall pay the tax hereby levied on the adjusted
amount thus reported in the statement.

stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method or in case any person operates a
division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the
Municipality constituting only a portion of its total business, the
Administrator shall require such additional information as may be necessary to
ascertain whether net profits allocable to the Municipality are being distorted
by the shifting of income, apportionment of expenses or other devices available
to a common control. If the Administrator finds that a person's net profits
allocable to the Municipality are distorted by reason of transactions with
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or transactions with such division, branch, factory,
office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he shall adjust such
transactions so as to produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to
the Municipality. If necessary, the Administrator may require the filing of a
consolidated return.

Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his
election indicated on the return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be
refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar
($1.00) shall be collected or refunded.
   (h)    Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting taxpayer's municipal tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended return showing income subject to municipal tax based
upon such final determination of federal tax liability and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (i)    If any employer who is liable for tax obligations imposed by this
chapter undergoes a fundamental change, then the employer and his or her
manager shall be liable for taxes due up to the date of the fundamental change.

change. Any successor employer shall withhold, from any purchase price that the
successor owes to the predecessor, an amount sufficient to pay all unpaid
taxes, interest and penalties which the predecessor employer owes pursuant to
this chapter. The successor employer shall make such withholding until such
time that the predecessor employer has paid such taxes, interest and penalties.
If the successor fails to withhold such amount, then the successor and, in a
personal manner, the successor's manager, shall be jointly and severally liable
for the payment of such taxes, interest and penalties. All residents of the

         (Ord. 11-108. Passed 6-2-11.)
   (b)    Every employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the source
is liable directly to the Municipality for the payment of such tax, whether it
is actually collected by the employer or not. Such employer in collecting the
tax shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to
the Municipality, as a trustee for the benefit of the Municipality and any such
tax collected by the employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid
to the Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of the employer.
   (c)    However, no person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or
other compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such
person's residence.
(Ord. 05-114. Passed 5-5-05; Ord. 09-114. Passed 5-7-09.)
181.08 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)    Every taxpayer or person who anticipates any taxable income which is
not subject to Section
181.07 hereof or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or
activity shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any.
   (b)    Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 30 for individual
taxpayers and April 15 for non-individual taxpayers of each year during the
life of this chapter, or within four months of the date of the taxpayer becomes
subject to the tax for the first time.
   (c)   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form or forms furnished by or
obtainable from, the Tax Administrator or on a generic form. Such form or forms
may require a statement that the figures used in making such declaration are
the figures used in making the declaration of the estimate for the federal
income tax adjusted to set forth only such income as is taxable under the
provisions of this chapter.
   (d)   (1)   For tax years prior to January 1, 2003, such declaration of
estimated tax to be paid to the Municipality shall be accompanied by a payment
of at least one-fourth of the estimated annual tax and at least a similar
amount shall be paid on or before July 31, October 31 and January 30.
      (2)   Beginning January 1, 2003, taxpayers who are individuals shall
remit payment of estimated taxes as follows:
         A.   Twenty-two and one-half per cent of the taxpayer's estimated tax
liability for the current year shall be remitted on or before the thirtieth day
of April or the day on which the annual tax return for the prior year is
required to be filed disregarding any extension, as prescribed by ordinance or
rule of the Village.
         B.   Forty-five per cent of the taxpayer's estimated tax liability for
the current year shall have been remitted on or before the thirty-first day of
July.
         C.   Sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the taxpayer's estimated tax
liability for the current year shall have been remitted on or before the
thirty-first day of October.
         D.   Ninety per cent of the taxpayer's estimated tax liability for the
year referred to in subsection (d)(2)A. B. and C. of this section shall have
been remitted on or before the thirty-first day of January following said year.
      (3)   Any amount deducted and withheld for taxes from the compensation of
an individual shall be considered as estimated taxes paid in equal amounts on
each of the payment dates prescribed by subsection (c) of this section.
      (4)   Beginning January 1, 2003, taxpayers that are not individuals shall
remit payments of estimated taxes as follows:
         A.   Twenty-two and one-half per cent of the taxpayer's estimated tax
liability for the current year shall be remitted on or before the day on which
the annual tax return for the prior year is required to be filed disregarding
any extension or, in the case of a fiscal year taxpayer, the fifteenth day of
the fourth month of the taxpayer's taxable year.
         B.   Forty-five per cent of the taxpayer's estimated tax liability for
the current year shall have been remitted on or before the fifteenth day of
June or, in the case of a fiscal year taxpayer, the fifteenth day of the sixth
month of the taxpayer's taxable year.

twelfth month of the taxpayer's taxable year.
   However, in case an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or before the
remaining payment date or dates, but in no case shall a payment be required
which constitutes a greater percentage of the taxpayer's estimated tax
liability than required above.
      (5)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before January 31 of any
year or in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year accounting basis, on or
before the date fixed by regulation of the Tax Administrator, if it appears
that the original or amended declaration made for the preceding year
underestimated the taxpayer's income by twenty percent or more. At such time a
payment which, together with prior payments is sufficient to pay taxpayer's
entire estimated liability, shall be made. If upon the filing of the return
required by Section
181.06 hereof, it appears that the taxpayer did not pay eighty percent of his
tax liability, as shown on such return, on or before January 31 or the date
fixed by regulation, whichever is applicable, the difference between eighty
percent of such taxpayer's liability and the amount of estimated tax he
actually paid on or before January 31 or the date fixed by regulation,
whichever is applicable, shall be subject to the interest and penalty
provisions of Section
181.11 hereof. However, any taxpayer whose declared taxes are equal to or
greater than the tax paid in the previous year or who was not domiciled in the
municipality on the first day of January of the tax year for which the
declaration is made shall not be assessed any interest or penalty for any
increased taxes found to be due in the current year.
      (6)   Such declaration shall indicate that the estimated tax is being
withheld under provisions of Section
181.07 hereof or is being paid to another municipality under a similar
ordinance.
 
   (e)   On or before April 15, or the date provided by subsection (d) of the
year following that for which such declaration or amended declaration was
filed, an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due the
Municipality shall be paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of
Section
181.11 hereof.
(Ord. 05-114. Passed 5-5-05; Ord. 09-114. Passed 5-7-09.)
181.09  DUTIES OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)    The Tax Administrator shall collect and receive the tax imposed by
this chapter in the manner prescribed by this chapter from the taxpayers. It
shall also be his duty to keep an accurate record for a minimum of five years
showing the amount received by him from each taxpayer required to file a
declaration and/or make a return and the date of such receipt.
   (b)    The Administrator is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of
the Board of Review, to adopt, promulgate and to enforce rules and regulations
relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the administration,
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including
provisions for the re-examination and correction of returns and payments.
   (c)    In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Administrator
shall fix the amount of tax actually due the Municipality from the taxpayer and
shall send to such taxpayer by certified mail, a written statement showing the
amount of tax so fixed, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.
(Ord. 05-114. Passed 5-5-05; Ord. 09-114. Passed 5-7-09.)
   (d)   The position of Deputy Tax Administrator is hereby established for the
Village of Middlefield. Such position shall be filled by the Village
Administrator. The Deputy Tax Administrator shall assist the Tax Administrator
when necessary. All municipal income tax information shall be available to the

information in the same manner as the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 11-113. Passed 5-12-11.)
181.10  INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)    The Tax Admninistrator, or any authorized employee, is hereby
authorized to examine the books, papers, records and federal income tax returns
of any employer or of any taxpayer subject to the tax for the purpose of
verifying the accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was made to
ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Every such employer, supposed
employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed and required to
furnish upon written request by the Administrator, or his duly authorized agent
or employee, the means, facilities, and opportunity for making such examination
and investigations as are hereby authorized.
   (b)    The Administrator is hereby authorized to order any person to appear
at the office of the Administrator and examine any person, under oath,
concerning any income which was or should have been returned for taxation or
any transaction tending to affect such income. For this purpose the
Administrator may compel the production of books, papers, records and federal
income tax returns and the attendance of all persons before him, whether as
parties or witnesses, whenever he believes such persons have knowledge of such
income or information pertinent to such inquiry.
   (c)    The refusal to produce books, papers, records and federal income tax
returns or the refusal of such examination by any employer or person subject or
presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent or employee of a
person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax or the failure of any
person to comply with the provisions of this section or with an order or
subpoena of the Tax Administrator authorized hereby shall be deemed a violation
of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section
181.99(a).
   (d)    Any information gained as the result of any returns, investigations,
hearings or verifications required or authorized by this chapter shall be
confidential, except for official purposes or except in accordance with proper
judicial order. No person shall divulge such information unless in compliance
with this subsection. Any information gained as a result of returns,
investigations, hearings, or verifications required or authorized by Chapter
718 of the Ohio Revised Code or by an ordinance of the Village is confidential,
and no person shall disclose such information except in accordance with a
proper judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's
official duties or the official business of the Village as authorized by said
chapter or ordinance authorizing the tax. The Administrator may furnish copies
of returns filed under this chapter to the internal revenue service and to the
Tax Administrator.
   (e)    As used in this section "official duties" means a disclosure to an
employee of the office of Department of Taxation, a member or employee of the
Board of Review, or an employee of the Federal Internal Revenue Service.
Disclosure to any other person shall be prima facie unlawful and a violation of
this section.
(Ord. 05-114. Passed 5-5-05; Ord. 09-114. Passed 5-7-09.)
181.11  INTEREST.
   (a)    All taxes imposed and all moneys withheld or required to be withheld
by employers under the provisions of this chapter and remaining unpaid after
they become due shall bear interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month
or fraction thereof, in addition to the amount of the unpaid tax or
withholdings.
   (b)    (1)   In addition to interest as provided in subsection (a) hereof,
penalties for nonpayment of taxes and moneys required to be withheld by
employers under the provisions of this chapter are hereby imposed as follows:
         A.   For failure to pay taxes due, other than taxes withheld: one and
one- half percent (1-1/2%) per month or fraction thereof.    Minimum penalty
for failure to file an annual return when due shall be twenty- five dollars
($25.00).
         B.   For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees: ten percent
(10%) per month or fraction thereof.
            (Ord. 05-114. Passed 5-5-05.)
      (2)   Over payments of withheld tax that have resulted due to incorrect
withholding of an employee by an employer, and are not due as a result of
excess withholding requested by the employee, shall be refunded to the
employer. It shall be the responsibility of the employer, and not the
Municipality, to refund such overpayment to the employee. However, nothing in
this provision shall affect the right of a non-resident employee to apply
directly to the Municipality for refunded income tax withheld for days worked
out of the Village. A written letter from the employer indicating the employee
did not work in Middlefield or a complete refund request form signed by the
employer must accompany a request for a refund.
(Ord. 11-108. Passed 6-2-11.)
   (c)   Either the Administrator hereunder or the Board of Review may abate a
penalty or interest, or both, in accordance with the following guidelines:
      (1)   After consultation with the Mayor and Finance Committee Chairman,
the Administrator may exercise reasonable judgment in compromising any interest
and/or penalties due the Village. Such reasonable judgment shall include, but
not be limited to consideration of the following factors:
         A.   The clarity of the liability of the taxpayer. The more certain
the liability of the taxpayer for the underlying tax, the lower the amount of
any compromise by the Administrator should be.
         B.   Any exculpatory reasons offered by the taxpayer for the
liability. Tax liabilities created by good-faith mistakes and/or minimal
negligence by the taxpayer may increase the amount of any compromise.
         C.   The collectability of the taxpayer. The greater the taxpayer’s
apparent collectability, the lower the amount of any compromise should be.
         D.   The taxpaying history of the taxpayer. The greater the taxpayer’s
history of compliance with the Village’s tax requirements, the greater the
amount of the compromise may be.
         E.   Any other relevant factor demonstrating good cause for a
compromise.
      (2)   In no event shall the Administrator compromise the amount of
interest owed to the Village by more than one thousand dollars ($1,000). In no
event shall the Administrator compromise the amount of penalties due by more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000).
      (3)   Any written offer of compromise not accepted by the taxpayer within
fifteen (15) days after the date of such written offer shall expire and such
offer of compromise by the Administrator shall not be binding upon the Village
in any subsequent appeal.
      (4)   The Board of Review may abate a penalty or interest, or both and
shall also consider the factors set forth in subsection (c)(1)A., B., C., D.
and E.
         (Ord. 09-114. Passed 5-7-09.)
   (d)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Chapter, including the
limitations of Sections
181.11(c)(2) and
181.13, the Fiscal Officer, with the approval of the Mayor and the Chair of the
Finance Committee, shall be empowered, on a case-case basis, to establish a
Delinquent Tax Payment Plan (“Payment Plan”) in order to collect previously-
assessed delinquent taxes, under the following circumstances.
      (1)   No payment Plan shall be entered into unless and until the tax
delinquency has been unpaid for a minimum period of six months, and the Fiscal
Officer, after consulting with the Tax Administrator, has made a determination
that absent the use of a Payment Plan, collection of the delinquent tax is not
likely.
      (2)   No payment Plan shall be entered into unless it provides for
payment of 100% of the delinquent income tax, exclusive of interest and
penalties.
      (3)   The Payment Plan shall require a minimum monthly payment of three
percent of the amount to be paid, and the full amount to be paid must be fully
paid within three years.
      (4)   Except as provided by subsection (d)(5) of this section, any
Payment Plan entered into will “freeze” the delinquent balance subject to
payment under the Payment Plan and no additional penalty or interest will be
compounded on said balance.
      (5)   No Payment Plan shall be entered into unless it requires all of the
following:
         A.   The taxpayer must make all payments on or before the dates
specified by the Payment Plan.
         B.   In addition to making all payments of the delinquent taxes as
specified by the Payment Plan, the taxpayer must timely pay all new taxes
accruing subsequent to the date of the Payment Plan (including withholding
taxes, if applicable), and all such taxes shall be paid on or before the date
due.
         C.   In addition to making all payments under the Payment Plan and
timely paying all new taxes, the Taxpayer shall timely file all tax returns due
subsequent to the date of the Payment Plan.
         D.   If any payment required by Section
181.11(d)(5)A. or Section
181.11(d)(5)B. is not made on time, or if the taxpayer fails to file any tax
return as required by Section
181.11(d)(5)C., the Payment Plan will be deemed null and void, and the full
amount due, including all interest and penalties (including interest and
penalties that accrued during the period of the Payment Plan), and any and all
taxes that were due subsequent to the adoption of the Payment Plan, will then
immediately be submitted for collection through legal action.
      (6)   If the taxpayer enters into the Payment Plan and successfully
completes all payments made thereunder, those payments shall constitute
satisfaction in full of all of the delinquent amounts (including interest and
penalties) originally determined to be owed.
      (7)   Nothing in the Payment Plan shall be construed as limiting or
relieving, in any way, any of the taxpayer’s obligations under this Chapter,
except as expressly provided in the Payment Plan.
         (Ord. 15-104. Passed 4-2-15.)
181.12 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by suit, as other debts of like amount are
recoverable. Except in the case of fraud, omission of a substantial portion of
income subject to this tax or failure to file a return, an additional
assessment shall not be made after three years from the date the return was due
or filed, whichever is later. However, in those cases in which the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the federal
statute of limitations, the period within which an additional assessment may be
made by the Administrator shall be one year from the time of the final
determination of the federal tax liability.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made within three years from the date which such payment was made or the
return was due, or within three months after the final determination of the
federal tax liability, whichever is later.
   (c)   Amounts of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall not be collected or
refunded.
(Ord. 05-114. Passed 5-5-05; Ord. 09-114. Passed 5-7-09.)
181.13  BOARD OF REVIEW.
   (a)    A Board of Review, consisting of the Solicitor, Mayor, Fiscal
Officer, President of Council and Chairman of the Finance and Ordinance
Committee is hereby created. All rules, regulations and amendments or changes
thereto, which are adopted by the Tax Administrator under the authority
conferred by this chapter, must be approved by the Board of Review before they
become effective. After approval, such rules, regulations, amendments and
changes shall be filed with the Fiscal Officer and shall be open to public
inspection.
   (b)    The Solicitor shall be Chairman of the Board of Review, and the
Fiscal Officer shall serve as secretary thereof. A majority of the members of
the Board shall constitute a quorum. The Board shall adopt its own procedural
rules and shall keep a record of its transactions.
   (c)    All hearings by the Board of Review may be conducted privately and
the provisions of Section
181.10 hereof with reference to the confidential character of information
required to be disclosed by this chapter shall apply to such matters as may be
heard before the Board on appeal.
   (d)    Any person dissatisfied with any ruling or decision of the Tax
Administrator, which is made under the authority conferred by this chapter may
appeal therefrom to the Board of Review within thirty days of such ruling or
decision; provided the taxpayer making the appeal has filed with the Village
the required return or other documents concerning the obligation at issue. The
appeal shall be in writing and shall state why the decision should be deemed
incorrect or unlawful. The Board shall, on hearing, have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse or modify any such ruling or decision, or any part thereof.
Such hearing shall be scheduled with 45 days from the date of appeal. The
board's ruling must be made within 30 days from the date of the closing of
record, shall be in writing and filed with the Administrator, who within 15
days of its decision shall send notice of its decision by ordinary mail to the
taxpayer making the appeal.
   (e)   for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2004, any person
dissatisfied with any ruling or decision of the Board of Review may appeal
therefrom to the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals or to the Common Pleas Court of
Geauga County, pursuant to Section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 05-
114. Passed 5-5-05; Ord. 09-114. Passed 5-7-09.)

181.16 AUTHORITY TO CONTRACT FOR CENTRAL COLLECTION FACILITIES.
   The Tax Administrator may, upon the proper authority granted by Council,
enter into an agreement on behalf of the Municipality with any other municipal
corporation for the purpose of administering the income tax laws of such other

another municipal corporation or another municipal corporation's collection on
behalf of the Municipality.

181.06 and
181.08, on and after January 1, 2005, any taxpayer that is subject to the
municipality's tax on the net profit from a business or profession and which
has received an extension to file the federal income tax return shall not be
required to notify the municipality of the federal extension and shall not be
required to file any annual return until the last day of the month following
that to which the due date for filing the federal return has been extended,
provided that, on or before the date for filing the annual return, the person
notifies the Ohio Tax Commissioner of the federal extension through the Ohio
Business Gateway. An extension of time to file is not an extension of the time
to pay any tax due.
   (b)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, a taxpayer
subject to the municipality's tax on the net profit from a business or
profession may file any tax return or estimated tax return, and may make

181.20  JOB CREATION INCOME TAX CREDIT PROGRAM.
   (a)    Purpose. There is hereby enacted a Job Creation Income Tax Credit,
the purpose of which is to encourage the development of jobs in the Village.
The Village Administrator or his/her designee is hereby authorized to
administer the program and to take all necessary and appropriate actions to
achieve its objectives.
   (b)    Criteria for Participation. The following are factors to consider in
evaluating applications to participate in the Job Creation Tax Credit Program.
The Village, in its sole discretion and on a case-by-case basis, may consider
applications that do not meet all of the criteria referenced below, if
extenuating circumstances exist and the spirit of the program is otherwise
satisfied.
      (1)    Any business entity which commits to the creation of at least
twenty-five new full-time or full-time equivalent jobs in the Village may be
eligible for the Job Creation Tax Credit. Firms new to the Village and current
businesses that are expanding are eligible to participate.
      (2)    Each applicant shall commit to establish, within no more than
three years of the approval of its application, a minimum of twenty-five new
jobs in the Village. "New jobs" does not include transfers of jobs from
affiliated companies which are already within the Village at the time of the
application.
      (3)   Each applicant must also commit to maintain its pre-application
number of jobs and levels of payroll in the Village, and to maintain its
operations in the Village at those levels for at least one additional year for
each year the tax credit is given.
      (4)    The Job Creation Tax Credit does not apply to wage and salary
increases of jobs existing at the time the application is submitted.
      (5)    Each applicant shall document that receiving the Job Creation Tax
Credit from the Village is a major factor in the taxpayer's decision to go
forward with its creation of new jobs in the Village.
      (6)    To qualify for this credit, the average wage (factoring in any
benefits paid to the employee) of new jobs shall be equivalent to a minimum of
1.75 times the minimum wage established by federal law.
      (7)    Each applicant shall commit that it will comply with all
applicable provisions of the Village's Codified Ordinances.
   (c)    Income Tax Credits. For those applicants which, in the opinion of the
Economic
Development Committee, satisfy the standards established in subsection (b)
hereof, the following apply:
      (1)    Income tax credits shall be granted only through a written Job
Creation Tax Credit Agreement ("JCTC Agreement") with each participant. Each
JCTC Agreement shall be authorized by the Economic Development Committee, in
its discretion, and approved by a motion passed by Village Council.
      (2)    The tax credit granted by this section is a refundable credit
against the participant's profit or income tax owed to the Village.
      (3)    The maximum job creation tax credit will be 50% of the municipal
income tax withheld om the qualifying new jobs, with a maximum job creation of
40% of the municipal income tax withheld on qualifying new jobs if the
participant also has a real estate property tax abatement on the facility where
the new jobs are located.
      (4)    The tax credit shall only apply to income taxes which the Village
ectually collects from the qualifying new jobs, reduced by any tax credits or
refunds granted or paid to said employees.
      (5)   Once Council has approved the JCTC Agreement, the employer shall be
entitled to the credit provided therein for each new job as defined in this
section. However, if the participant does not achieve the promised level of job
creation within the period prescribed by the JCTC Agreement (e.g. 25 jobs
within the first three years), the participant shall pay to the Village all
taxes for which the participant has taken a tax credit under the JCTC
Agreement, plus interest at 8% per annum.
      (6)    The maximum term of credit granted under this section shall not
exceed five years; provided that the period may be increased only if necessary
to satisfy any local match required by the State of Ohio for securing an Ohio
job creation tax credit agreement with the applicant. In no event shall the
maximum term be no longer than the period allowed under the Ohio tax credit
agreement entered into pursuant to Ohio R.C. 122.17, as applicable.
      (7)    Tax credits shall no carry forward from one year to the next.
      (8)   Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the JCTC
Agreement may result in sanctions, up to and including the amendment or
termination of the job creation tax credit, as well as liability for repayment
of all taxes previously credited to the participant pursuant to said Agreement,
plus interest.
      (9)    The Village Administrator or his/her designee shall annually audit
relevant business records of each employer receiving the Job Creation Tax
Credit to determine the employer's continued eligibility for the tax credit, as
provided by the JCTC Agreement.

182.01 AUTHORITY TO LEVY TAX; PURPOSES OF TAX; RATE.
182.011 AUTHORITY TO LEVY TAX.
   (A)    The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this Chapter
181 are authorized by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution. The
tax on income and the withholding tax established by this Chapter
181 are deemed to be levied in accordance with, and to be consistent with, the
provisions and limitations of Ohio Revised Code 718 (ORC 718). This Chapter is
deemed to incorporate the provisions of ORC 718.
   (B)   The tax is an annual tax levied on the income of every person residing
in or earning or receiving income in the municipal corporation, and shall be
measured by municipal taxable income. The Municipality shall tax income at a
uniform rate. The tax is levied on Municipal Taxable Income, as defined herein.
(Ord . 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.012 PURPOSES OF TAX; RATE.
   (A)   The purpose of the income tax imposed by this chapter is to provide
funds for general municipal operations, for maintenance of equipment,
acquisition of new equipment, extension, enlargement and improvement of
municipal services, facilities and capital improvements and infrastructure
repairs maintenance and improvements.
   (B)   The rate of the income tax shall be one and one quarter percent
(1.25%) per annum, with at least one quarter of one percent (0.25%) of said
revenue devoted exclusively to infrastructure repairs maintenance and
improvements. (Ord. 18-113. Passed 6-14-18.)
182.013 ALLOCATION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   In the taxation of income which is subject to Village income taxes if
the taxpayer shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net
profit is attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted
within the boundaries of the Village, then only such portion shall be
considered as having a taxable situs in the Village for the purposes of
municipal income taxation. The portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer
to be allocated as having been derived from within the Village, shall be
determined as follows:
   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation percentage to be
determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll, and sales, each of
which shall be given equal weight as follows:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all real and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated:
As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property rented
or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)    Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed excluding compensation that is not taxable pursuant to
section 718.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (3)    Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed;
   (B)   If the formula in subsection (A) does not produce an equitable result,
another basis may be used as a substitute method under uniform regulations so
as to produce such a result. If books and records are used, the following shall
apply:
   The net profits allocable to the Village from business, professional or
other activities conducted in the Village by corporations or unincorporated
entities (whether resident or non-resident) may be determined from the records
of the taxpayer only if the taxpayer has bona fide records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy what portion of his net profits is attributable to that
part of his activities conducted within the Village.
   If the books and records of the taxpayer are used as the basis for
apportioning net profits, a statement must accompany the return explaining the
manner in which such apportionment is made in sufficient detail to enable the
administrator to determine whether the net profits attributable to the Village
are apportioned with reasonable accuracy.
   In determining the income allocable to the Village from the books and
records of a taxpayer, an adjustment may be made for the contribution made to
the production of such income by headquarters activities of the taxpayer,
whether such headquarters is within or without the Village.
   (C)   This section shall not apply to individuals who are residents of the
Village.
(Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.014 STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY; STATE MANDATED CHANGES TO MUNICIPAL
INCOME TAX.
   (A)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by Am
Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014 ("H.B. 5"), and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to
conform to and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority
to impose, enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 2015-121,
effective January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Chapter
181 in accordance with the provisions of ORC 718 to allow the Municipality to
continue the income tax and withholding tax administration and collection
efforts on behalf of the Municipality.
(Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
   (C)   In 2017, additional wide-ranging amendments were mandated by Am.Sub.
H.B. No. 49 of the 132nd General Assembly, effective January 31, 2018. In
reluctant compliance with those mandates, Chapter
182 of the Codified Ordinances, including Section
182.03,
182.04,
182.063,
182.081,
182.094 and 182.100 are hereby amended to be consistent with the mandates of
H.B. 49, but only to the extent said provisions have not been held to be
unlawful, unconstitutional or otherwise unforceable as a result of the various
legal challenges to H.B. 49 that are pending as of the effective date of this
Section 182.014(C). (Ord. 17-142. Passed 12-7-17.)
182.02 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   (A)   Ordinance 2015-121, effective January 1, 2016, and corresponding
changes to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 718, apply to municipal taxable years
beginning on or after January 1, 2016. All provisions of this Chapter
182 apply to taxable years beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.
   (B)   Ordinance 2015-121 does not repeal the existing sections of Chapter
181 for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather amends Chapter
181 effective January 1, 2016. For municipal taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2016, the Municipality shall continue to administer, audit, and
enforce the income tax of the Municipality under Revised Code Chapter 718 and
ordinances and resolutions of the Municipality as that chapter and those
ordinances and resolutions existed before January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)

chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title 57 of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title 57 of the Ohio Revised
Code.

under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible

carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than

section is carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable
year beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in

publicly traded partnership that has made the election described in division

(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.

   (B)   (1)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit

   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
182.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have

information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

one of the following conditions applies:   
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

more than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)    The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
182.051 of this Chapter.
               (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
182.051 of this Chapter.

return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)    For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
182.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:

in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in

      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
182.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

      (4)   "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
182.03 (32) of this Chapter.
(Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)

   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Except as provided in divisions (B) and (I) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
182.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B) (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made
and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual, shall be subject to the Municipality's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Municipality or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the
Municipality. The Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for tho purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.

to tho sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be situsod to the

corporation, if applicable, based upon the ratio of tho commissions tho agent
or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in
the municipal corporation to the commissions received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under Section
 182.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)    Intentionally left blank.
   (H)    Intentionally left blank.
   (I)   (1)   As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)   "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer:
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
182.05 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year:
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year:
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (1)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records.
               A taxpayer may change the qualifying reporting location
designated for an employee or owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (A) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner"s activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (1)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B)(1), (B)(2), (B)(3) and (B)(4) of this section.
However, a tax administrator shall not require an alternative apportionment
method in such a manner that it would require a taxpayer to file a net profit
return with a municipal corporation solely because a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located in that
municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
182.05 of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 23-151. Passed 11-9-23.)
182.063 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of Section
182.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
182.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   The Municipality, by Ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality

derives from the retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term
not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.

estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to a municipal

purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve months
shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.

      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
182.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section 182.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end

      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated

   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of

in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
182.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

182.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
182.081 TAXES PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPAL CORPORATION.
   There shall be no credit provided for tax paid to another municipal
corporation for work or services performed in the other municipal corporation.
(Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
182.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
182.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
182.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
182.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)    An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on

      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, or other payer located in
the Municipality under subsection
182.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)    A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-

refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request

      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other

Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or

end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or (c) of Section
182.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)    If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
182.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
182.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.   
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax

182.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18 of this Chapter.

postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in

employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
182.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 of this Chapter for a violation of Section
182.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
182.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
        (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 15-121. Passed 11–5-15.)
182.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
182.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
       (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
182.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 15-121. Passed 11-5-15.)
182.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.  
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Tax Administrator,
is hereby granted authority to propose rules to administer the income tax
imposed by the Municipality, which shall become effective upon their approval
by Council.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on

182.21 JOB CREATION INCOME TAX CREDIT PROGRAM.
   (A)   Purpose.  There is hereby enacted a Job Creation Income Tax Credit,
the purpose of which is to encourage the development of jobs in the Village.
The Village Administrator or his/her designee is hereby authorized to
administer the program and to take all necessary and appropriate actions to
achieve its objectives.
   (B)   Criteria for Participation. The following are factors to consider in
evaluating applications to participate in the Job Creation Tax Credit Program.
The Village, in its sole discretion and on a case-by-case basis, may consider
applications that do not meet all of the criteria referenced below, if
extenuating circumstances exist and the spirit of the program is otherwise
satisfied.
      (1)    Any business entity which commits to the creation of at least
twenty-five new full-time or full-time equivalent jobs in the Village may be
eligible for the Job Creation Tax Credit. Firms new to the Village and current
businesses that are expanding are eligible to participate.
      (2)    Each applicant shall commit to establish, within no more than
three years of the approval of its application, a minimum of twenty-five new
jobs in the Village. "New jobs" does not include transfers of jobs from
affiliated companies which are already within the Village at the time of the
application.
      (3)    Each applicant must also commit to maintain its pre-application
number of jobs and levels of payroll in the Village, and to maintain its
operations in the Village at those levels for at least one additional year for
each year the tax credit is given.
      (4)    The Job Creation Tax Credit does not apply to wage and salary
increases of jobs existing at the time the application is submitted.
      (5)    Each applicant must concurrently secure a state tax credit
pursuant to a job creation agreement with the State of Ohio as authorized by
Ohio Revised Code 122.17.
      (6)   Each applicant shall document that receiving the Job Creation Tax
Credit from the Village is a major factor in the taxpayer's decision to go
forward with its creation of new jobs in the Village.
      (7)    To qualify for this credit, the average wage (factoring in any
benefits paid to the employee) of new jobs shall be equivalent to a minimum of
1.75 times the minimum wage established by federal law.
      (8)    Each applicant shall commit that it will comply with all
applicable provisions of the Village's Codified Ordinances.
   (C)   Income Tax Credits. For those applicants which, in the opinion of the
Economic Development Committee, satisfy the standards established in subsection
(b) hereof, the following apply:
      (1)    Income tax credits shall be granted only through a written Job
Creation Tax Credit Agreement ("JCTC Agreement") with each participant. Each
JCTC Agreement shall be authorized by the Economic Development Committee, in
its discretion, and approved by a motion passed by Village Council.
      (2)    The tax credit granted by this section is a refundable credit
against the participant's profit or income tax owed to the Village.
      (3)    The maximum job creation tax credit will be 50% of the municipal
income tax withheld on the qualifying new jobs, with a maximum job creation
credit of 40% of the municipal income tax withheld on qualifying new jobs if
the participant also has a real estate property tax abatement on the facility
where the new jobs are located.
      (4)    The tax credit shall only apply to income taxes which the Village
actually collects from the qualifying new jobs, reduced by any tax credits or
refunds granted or paid to said employees.
      (5)    Once Council has approved the JCTC Agreement, the employer shall
be entitled to the credit provided therein for each new job as defined in this
section. However, if the participant does not achieve the promised level of job
creation within the period prescribed by the JCTC Agreement (e.g. 25 jobs
within the first three years), the participant shall pay to the Village all
taxes for which the participant has taken a tax credit under the JCTC
Agreement, plus interest at 8% per annum.
      (6)   The maximum term of credit granted under this section shall not
exceed five years; provided that the period may be increased only if necessary
to satisfy any local match required by the State of Ohio for securing an Ohio
job creation tax credit agreement with the applicant. In no event shall the
maximum term be longer than the period allowed under the Ohio tax credit
agreement entered into pursuant to Revised Code Section 122.17.
      (7)    Tax credits shall not carry forward from one year to the next.
      (8)    Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the JCTC
Agreement may result in sanctions, up to and including the amendment or
termination of the job creation tax credit, as well as liability for repayment
of all taxes previously credited to the participant pursuant to said Agreement,
plus interest.
      (9)   The Village Administrator or his/her designee shall annually audit
relevant business records of each employer receiving the Job Creation Tax
Credit to determine the employer's continued eligibility for the tax credit, as

      (3)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the information contained within the
Job Creation Income Tax Agreement authorized pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof is considered to be a public record.
      (4)    The Village Administrator, the Fiscal Officer and the Village Tax
Administrator may also make use of the statements and other information
obtained pursuant to this section in enforcing the provisions of this chapter
and the Job Creation Tax Credit Agreement, including, if necessary, the use of

182.22 JOB RETENTION GRANT PROGRAM.
   (a)    Purpose. The purpose of the Village of Middlefield's Job Retention
Grant Program (the "Program") is to provide an economic incentive for
businesses to remain or expand within the Village. The Program specifically

      (4)    "New Annual Payroll" means the dollar amount of new or additional
payroll attributable to New Jobs.
      (5)    "New Jobs:" means any position created by a Business for an

attributable or reported in the Village.
   (c)    Business Eligibility. A Business is eligible for the Program if it is

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under

removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and

evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
 
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
(ORC 4511.99)
313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to

urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the court
may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described

physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.

in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term

sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a
         drivers’ intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender
to a jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the
offender does not spend attending the program. The court may require the
offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the required
attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily
complete any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum
standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental
Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the drivers’ intervention
program determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to
the court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose
on the offender any other conditions of community control that it considers
necessary.

subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.

consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.

education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.

five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is

than will permit the person to bring it to a stop within the assured clear
distance ahead.
   (b)   It is prima-facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or
established pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.21 by the Ohio Director of

construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, "school" means all of the following:

shall create a school zone at that location by erecting the appropriate signs.
         C.   As used in this section, "school zone" means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is
encompassed by projecting the school property lines to the fronting street or
highway. Upon request from the Municipality for streets and highways under its
jurisdiction, the Ohio Director of Transportation may extend the traditional

recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet

preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

have more than one valid license at any time.
(ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.
   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Occupant restraining device” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.

         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a

electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the

(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed

of guilty, waiver of court appearance and acknowledgment of conviction of the
offense alleged and may be accepted in full satisfaction of the prescribed

   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.
(ORC 2901.11)
501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin

      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)    No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)    It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)    No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)    It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented its
commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (e)    Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)    No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)    Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)    Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)    Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)    It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)    No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)    If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following: "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but
the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and
make his testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed
with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)    It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)    An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in
Section
501.13 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)    In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)    He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)    When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section,
he is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13 DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY HELD BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.
   (a)    Any property that the Police Department has seized pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2933.42 and any contraband in the custody of the Police Department that is
subject to the forfeiture provisions of Ohio R.C. 2933.43 shall be held and
disposed of pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2933.43.
   (b)    Except for the property described in subsection (a) hereof, any

2981.01 et seq.
   (c)    The Village Administrator is hereby authorized and directed to
establish a separate fund which shall be known as the "Law Enforcement Trust
Fund" the ("Trust Fund"). Moneys resulting from the retention, sale or other
disposition by the Police Department of contraband forfeited pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2933.43(C) shall be deposited in the Trust Fund after payment of the
charges set forth in Ohio R.C. 2933.43(D). Subject to the provisions of
subsection (d) hereof, moneys from the Trust Fund shall be allocated by Council
to the Police Department only and shall only be expended for one or more of the
following purposes:
      (1)    To pay the cost of protracted or complex investigations or
prosecutions;
      (2)    To provide technical training or expertise;
      (3)    To provide matching funds to obtain federal grants to aid law
enforcement; or
      (4)    For such other law enforcement purposes as Council may determine
to be appropriate.
   (d)    A minimum of ten percent (10%) of the first one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000) of moneys held in the Trust Fund and a minimum of twenty
percent (20%) of the moneys exceeding one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)
in the Trust Fund shall be allocated and used solely for providing reasonable
technical training or expertise for the Police Department. The Police
Department shall adopt a written internal control policy governing the use of
proceeds received from the fund and shall annually submit to the Ohio Attorney
General a cumulative report of the receipts and general expenditures of such
proceeds.
   (e)    Any and all moneys which result from the retention, sale or other
disposition of property by the Police Department and that do not qualify for

R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

OPIOID OFFENDER.
   (a)   Any person who is the subject of more than one emergency service call
by the Village Police, EMS, or the Village-funded ambulance services, or any
combination thereof, for treatment for actual or suspected narcotics ingestion
or overdose, shall reimburse the Village the amount of $666.33 for each
treatment in excess of the first treatment.
   (b)   Upon the request of Council, the Village Solicitor shall seek to
collect such amount from the above described person and/or his or her parent or
guardian, in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
(Ord. 18-128. Passed 12-13-18.)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;

days.

section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)

501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions
of Section
545.05 or
545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

(Ord. 02-121. Passed 6-6-02.)
   (o)    Testing. 
      (1)    All sewers shall be tested by the infiltration or exfiltration
method. Where the major portion of the sewer was installed in water bearing
conditions, the infiltration method shall be used. On all other installations
the exfiltration method shall be used.
      (2)    In the infiltration test, the depth of water flow, prior to
connection of any services, shall be measured in consecutive manholes and the
volume rate of flow determined therefrom.
      (3)    The exfiltration tests shall be performed as follows:
         A.    Each run between manholes shall be blocked off and the sewer
filled with water to a height of three feet over the invert of the upper
manhole but not exceeding four feet over the lower manhole. The lengths of
laterals shall be included and the test performed after installation of the
laterals.
         B.    The maximum loss by the exfiltration method or flow by the
infiltration method shall be calculated at the rate of three hundred gallons
per twenty-four hours per inch of pipe diameter per mile of sewer tested.
      (4)    All installations using polyvinyl chloride pipe shall be tested
for deflection, i.e., the reduction in vertical inside diameter. The maximum
allowable polyvinyl chloride pipe deflection shall be five percent (5%). Any
location with deflection in excess of five percent (5%) shall be excavated and
repaired by re-bedding or replacement of the pipe.
      (5)    Devices for testing deflection in polyvinyl chloride pipe shall
include a properly size "go, no-go" mandrel or sewer ball. For the purpose of
deflection measurement, the base inside pipe diameters without deflection are
provided in the following table:

NOTE:    Base I.D. is a minimum pipe I.D. derived by subtracting a statistical
tolerance package from the pipe's average I.D. The tolerance package is defined
as the square root of the sum of squared standard manufacturing tolerances.
 
Avg. ID = Avg OD - 2(1.06)t
Tolerance Package =( A2 + B2 + C2) ½
Where:
A = OD Tolerance (ASTM D3034)
B = Excess Wall Thickness Tolerance - 0.06t
C = Out-of-Roundness Tolerance - 0.015 (Avg. OD)
t = Minimum Wall Thickness(ASTM D3034)
The maximum allowable deflection should be applied to these base inside
diameters in determining the minimum permissible diameter. To insure accurate
testing, the lines shall first be thoroughly cleaned.
      (6)    Final acceptance of the sewer installation shall be based on the
inspection of the sewers by the television method. All televising of the sewers
shall be viewed by a representative of the Municipality. A report on the
findings of the television inspection shall also be filed with the Municipality
by the company doing the televised inspection work.
      (7)    All testing and inspection costs shall be at the owner's expense.
   (p)    Use Permit.
      (1)    Following the completion of all sewer installation work and site
area cleanup, the Municipal Engineer shall determine the acceptability of the
work and report in writing to the Municipality. The owner shall then receive
from the Municipality a use permit allowing the sewer installation to be put
into service.
      (2)    The owner, however, shall not be relieved of any liability for
maintenance, repair, or injury resulting from the sewer installation work.
      (3)    For a period of one year from the issuance of the use permit the
owner, at his expense, shall perform all maintenance, make all repairs to the
sewer installation and all repairs to adjacent structures, utilities, pavement,
drives, sidewalks, or others harmed as a result of the installation work. The
owner shall also hold the Municipality free from any responsibility for bodily
injury resulting from any part of the sewer installation.
   (q)    Bond. As a guarantee for the faithful performance of the repairs for
one year, set forth in subsection (p) herein, the owner shall furnish to the
Municipality a surety bond executed by an acceptable surety company in an
amount to be determined by the Municipality but not to exceed five percent of
the estimated cost of construction of the total sanitary sewage project.
      (Ord. 479. Passed 4-3-72; Ord. 90-130. Passed 7-16-90.)

promulgated.
(Ord. 94-122. Passed 6-16-94.)
905.05 STATE AND LOCAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges
to the POTW shall be met by all dischargers which are subject to those
standards in any instance in which they are more stringent that Federal
requirements and limitations or those in this chapter or any other applicable
ordinance.
 
   (b)   Village Requirements. No person shall discharge, or cause or allow to
be discharged, industrial wastes or unpolluted water into any sewer within the
jurisdiction of the Village and/or into the POTW without a permit issued by the
Village and without first having complied with the terms and conditions
established in this chapter.
 
   (c)   Supplementary Limitations. No user shall discharge wastewater
concentrations and/or mass loadings to the POTW exceeding those limits
specified in the discharger's permit issued by the Village.
(Ord. 94-122. Passed 6-16-94.)
905.06 RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The Village may, at any time, with or without prior notice, amend this
chapter to provide more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to
the POTW.
(Ord. 94-122. Passed 6-16-94.)
905.07 DILUTION.
   (a)   No discharger shall increase the use of potable or process water in
any way for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment or for the purpose of achieving compliance
with the standards set forth in this chapter, required by permit, required by
applicable federal pretreatment standards or contained in any State
requirements. This shall not prohibit the use of equalization tanks utilized to
regulate flows.
 
   (b)   The Village may impose mass limitations on SIU's which are suspected
of using dilution to meet the Pretreatment Standards or other requirements of
this chapter, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is
deemed appropriate by the Village.
(Ord. 94-122. Passed 6-16-94.)
905.08 PRETREATMENT MEASURES.
   (a)   SIU's shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with
this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all Pretreatment Standards,
local limits and the requirements of Section
905.03 within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State or the Village,
whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be
provided, operated and maintained at the SIU's expense. Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Village for review and approval and shall not be constructed until Village
approval is first obtained. The review of such plans and operating procedures
shall in no way relieve the SIU's responsibility to modify such facilities as
necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the Village under the provisions
of this chapter.
   (b)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Superintendent may require any
discharger to restrict its discharge during peak flow periods, designate that
certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial
wastestreams and take such other actions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW.
 
   (c)   The Superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on that person's property and at that person's expense, a
suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A
Wastewater Discharge Permit may be required and issued solely for flow
equalization.
 
   (d)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease, oil or sand, except that
such interceptors shall not be required of residential users unless otherwise
provided by the Codified Ordinances. All interception units shall be of a type
and capacity approved by the Village and shall be so located to be easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected,
cleaned and repaired regularly, as needed, by the discharger at the
discharger's expense.
 
   (e)   Dischargers with the potential to discharge flammable substances may
be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection
meter.
(Ord. 94-122. Passed 6-16-94.)
905.09 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES AND OPERATIONAL UPSETS.
   (a)   To enable countermeasures to be taken to minimize interference with or
damage to the POTW or to prevent or reduce the severity of a pass through, upon
the accidental discharge of wastes in violation of this chapter, or upon the
occurrence of an upset in operation or a bypass of a discharger's pretreatment
facility which places the discharger in a state of noncompliance with its
Wastewater Treatment Permit or this chapter, the discharger shall immediately
notify the Village and the POTW treatment plant operator on duty. The
notification shall include location of discharge, the nature of the upset or
bypass, the date and time thereof, the type of waste, concentrations and volume
and the corrective actions taken and to be taken by the discharger.
 
   (b)   Within five days of the date of occurrence of the accidental
discharge, upset or bypass, the discharger shall submit to the Superintendent a
detailed written statement describing the causes of the accidental discharge,
upset or bypass and the measures being taken to prevent future such
occurrences. The report shall specify:
      (1)   A description of the event, the cause thereof and its impact on the
discharger's compliance status;
      (2)   The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance and, if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur; and
      (3)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an event or other conditions of noncompliance.
 
   (c)   When the discharger can demonstrate that circumstances which would
create an unreasonable burden on the discharger to supply the follow-up report
within the time schedule imposed by subsection (b) hereof, the discharger may
present a request for extension of time for consideration by the Village.
 
   (d)   Failure to report an accidental discharge, an upset or a bypass and
failure to report within the described time period shall give cause for
enforcement action by the Village.
 
   (e)   Such notification will not relieve the discharger of liability for any
fines provided for in this chapter, or for any expense, loss or damage to the
POTW, the treatment plant, or treatment process or for any fines imposed on the
Village on account thereof.
 
   (f)   Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on the
discharger's premises advising employees of whom to call in the event of a
slugload or accidental discharge. Employers shall instruct all employees who
may cause or discover such a discharge about all required emergency
notification procedures.
 
   (g)   Accidental Discharge Control Plan: The Superintendent may require a
plan to control accidental discharges from each SIU. An accidental discharge is
any discharge of a non-routine, episodic nature including, but not limited to,
an accidental spill or a non-customary batch discharge. The Plan shall contain
the following elements:
      (1)   A description of discharge practices and stored chemicals;
      (2)   Notification procedures; and
      (3)   Procedures to prevent or control a discharge to the POTW from
accidental spills.
   (h)   Each SIU shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this chapter.
Any direct or indirect connection or entry point for accidental discharge to
the discharger's plumbing or drainage system shall be eliminated. Where such
action is determined impractical or unreasonable by the Superintendent, the SIU
shall appropriately label such entry points to warn against discharge of wastes
in violation of this chapter. Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental
discharge of prohibited material shall be provided and maintained at the SIU's
expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide
this protection shall be submitted to the Superintendent for review and shall
be approved by the Superintendent before construction of the facility. Review
and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the SIU
from the responsibility to modify this facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 94-122. Passed 6-16-94.)
905.10 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT.
   All SIUs proposing to connect to or to discharge sewage, industrial wastes

905.12 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Compliance Data Report. Within ninety days following the date for
final compliance by the SIU with applicable pretreatment standards set forth in
the SIU's Wastewater Discharge Permit or ninety days following commencement of
the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new discharger, any
discharger subject to this chapter shall submit to the Village a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated
substances contained in its discharge and the average and maximum daily flow in
gallons. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards
or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional operations and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring
the discharger into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the discharger.
 
   (b)   Periodic Compliance Reports. Each SIU shall submit periodic compliance
reports indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the SIU's
discharge. The frequencies of monitoring and reporting and the pollutants to be
analyzed shall be prescribed in the Wastewater Discharge Permit. All analyses
shall be performed in accordance with procedures established in 40 CFR 136, as
amended. When 40 CFR 136 does not include sampling or analytical techniques or
the techniques are inappropriate, alternative methods may be approved by the
Village. In addition, the report shall include a record of all measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period. Flows
shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement provided; however, where
cost or feasibility considerations justify, the Superintendent may authorize
the submission of reports of average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable
techniques. The Village, for good cause, considering those factors such as
local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles or other extenuating
factors, may require the submission of the reports on months other than those
specified above. All reports shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the discharger.
   (c)   If sampling performed by any discharger indicates a violation of any
permit limitation or Pretreatment Standard, the discharger shall notify the
Village within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The
discharger shall repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results within
thirty days after becoming aware of the violation. If a discharger monitors any
pollutant more frequently than required by the Village using the procedures
prescribed in 40 CFR 403.12, the results of this monitoring shall be included
in the periodic compliance report.
 
   (d)   All dischargers shall notify the Village in advance of any substantial
change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including
the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the discharger has
submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p).
(Ord. 94-122. Passed 6-16-94.)
905.13 MONITORING FACILITIES.
   (a)   Each person applying for a Wastewater Discharge Permit if so directed
by the Village, shall provide and operate, at its own expense, a monitoring
facility to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of each sewer
discharge point. Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the discharger's
premises. Where such location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to
the discharger, the Village may allow the discharger to construct the facility
in the public street or sidewalk area, provided that the facility will not be
obstructed by landscaping, utilities, parked vehicles and will be accessible at
all times. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The discharger shall
maintain, at its expense, facility, sampling and measuring equipment in a safe
and proper operating condition. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed
and maintained in accordance with all applicable local construction standards
and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety days, unless
specified otherwise by the Village, on receipt of written notice from the
Village directing the discharger to construct the facilities.
 
   (b)   All dischargers, if directed by the Superintendent, shall have an
inspection and sampling manhole or structure with an opening of no less than
twenty-four inches diameter and an internal diameter of no less than forty-
eight inches containing such flow measuring, recording and sampling equipment
as may be required by the Village to ensure compliance with this chapter. Such
structure may be first so utilized by the discharger for its monitoring program
if first so approved by the Village. The discharger shall obtain all required
permits prior to construction of monitoring facilities.
(Ord. 94-122. Passed 6-16-94.)
905.14 INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.

shall allow the Village or its representatives, without prior notice, upon
presentation of credentials of identification, to enter upon the premises of
the discharger at all hours for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
observation, measurement, testing, records examination or the performance of
any of their duties. Delays in permitting access by Village personnel in excess
of ten minutes shall be considered a violation of the Wastewater Discharge
Permit and this chapter and shall subject the discharger to the civil and
criminal penalties provided for herein. The Village shall have the right to set
up, on the discharger's property, necessary devices to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring, metering operation or all of these. The
Village shall have the right to copy the discharger's records relevant to
determining compliance with the requirements of the Codified Ordinances.
(Ord. 94-122. Passed 6-16-94.)
905.15 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets or
proprietary information of the discharger, and
      (2)   Nondisclosure of the information and data is permissible under the
provisions of the Ohio Open Records Law.
 
   (b)   Except as otherwise required by law, when requested by the discharger
furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the
public, but shall be made available upon written request to governmental
agencies for use related to this chapter, the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, State Disposal System Permit, the
Pretreatment Program or all of these, provided, however, that such portions of
a report shall be available for use by the State or any State Agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the discharger furnishing
the report.
 
   (c)   Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information. Except as otherwise required by the Ohio Open Records
Law, information accepted by the Village as confidential shall not be
transmitted to any party except as provided herein and unless a ten-day
notification is given to the discharger.
(Ord. 94-122. Passed 6-16-94.)
905.16 CHARGES AND FEES.
   After consulting with the Mayor and the Village Engineer, the Superintendent
shall adopt charges and fees, which may include:
   (a)   Charges and fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance
procedures including all costs associated with sampling and analyses for Total

In the event that the Village Administrator determines that a temporary water
permit should be issued, it shall only be issued subject to the following
conditions:
      (1)   The Village Administrator shall issue a Temporary Water Permit only
if the Zoning Inspector has determined that the project is in compliance with

promptly remit additional funds, in an amount to be determined by the Village
Administrator.
      (6)   The Temporary Water Permit shall be deemed to have expired as of
the date that an Occupancy Permit for the structure is issued. No Occupancy
Permit shall be issued unless all charges incurred for the temporary water
connection have first been paid.
      (7)   Upon expiration of the Temporary Water Permit, or in the event that
water charges exceed the deposit and the applicant has not remitted additional
funds as requested, the Municipality may, without notice, terminate the
temporary water connection.

calculating the fee, subject to the following:
   (a)   As part of the basis for the Impact Fee calculation, Council shall
adopt a Utility Capital Improvements Plan.
   (b)   At least once every two years, the Utilities Committee shall review
the Utility Capital Improvements Plan (“Plan”) and shall make recommendations
to Council regarding amendments to the Plan. Upon receipt of those
recommendations, Council shall either approve the existing Plan or amend the
existing Plan for use during the following two years.
   (c)   The Village may impose Impact Fees as a condition of approval of all
Industrial, Commercial and Residential Development Projects in the Village
which occur after the effective date of this chapter.
   (d)   The amount of Impact Fee for each type of residential and commercial
project in the Village shall be calculated as follows:
      (1)   The Utilities Committee shall estimate the gallon per day water
usage for each type of residential and commercial project, either by conducting
statistical analyses or by adopting standards promulgated by a recognized
governmental authority.
      (2)   The Utilities Committee shall then determine the recommended
“Impact Fee Factor” by dividing the total cost of the improvements described in
the Utility Capital Improvements Plan by the number of gallons per day of
increased water plant and wastewater treatment plant capacity that full
implementation of the Utility Capital Improvements Plan will create.
      (3)   The Utilities Committee shall then determine the recommended Impact
Fee for each type of project by multiplying the estimated gallon per day water
usage for the project by the Impact Fee Factor.
      (4)   The recommendations of the Utilities Committee for estimated water
usage, Impact Fee Factor and Impact Fees shall be forwarded to Council for its
review and approval. The recommendations, as approved or modified by Council,
shall become final upon adoption by a majority of Council.
   (e)   The amount of the Impact Fee for industrial projects shall be
calculated as set forth in Section
913.04.
   (f)   If the Utility Capital Improvements Plan contemplates a required
increase in the capacity of the water system in an amount that is different
from the required increase in the capacity for the wastewater treatment plant,
then separate Impact Fees shall be calculated for the water system and the
wastewater treatment plant improvements.
(Ord. 98-104. Passed 3-5-98.)
913.04 CALCULATION AND COLLECTION OF IMPACT FEES.
   (a)   Prior to the issuance of any Preliminary or Final Zoning Certificate
or any certificate of occupancy, the Zoning Inspector shall determine the
Impact Fee, calculated as provided in the legislation imposing the Impact Fee
and as provided in this section.
 
   (b)   The Village Administrator shall review the Zoning Inspector's
determination of the Impact Fee, and after confirming that the calculation is
correct, shall impose the Impact Fee upon the developer.
 
   (c)   The Impact Fee shall be collected by the Village as a condition for
issuance of a Final Zoning Certificate.
 
   (d)   For industrial uses, as defined in Section
1153.06(a), the Impact Fee shall be calculated and collected as follows:
      (1)   Prior to obtaining a Preliminary Zoning Certificate, the developer
shall submit a good faith estimate (“Developer’s Estimate”) of the estimated
water usage, estimated in gallons per day.
      (2)   The Zoning Inspector shall use the Developer’s Estimate to
determine the Estimated Impact Fee. The Estimated Impact Fee shall be
calculated by multiplying the Developer’s Estimate by the Impact Fee Factor, as
defined by Section
913.03(d)(2). The Village shall collect this fee at the time specified by
Section
913.05.
      (3)   Two years after the issuance of the Final Zoning Permit, the
Village Administrator shall review the water used by the project during the
preceding year in order to determine the accuracy of the Developer’s Estimate.
      (4)   The Village Administrator shall determine whether the Developer’s
Estimate was higher than, equal to or lower than the actual average daily water
use, estimated in gallons per day, which occurred during the preceding year.
The Village Administrator shall then determine the amount of impact fee
overpayment or underpayment by multiplying the difference between the
Developer’s Estimate and the actual usage by the Impact Fee Factor.
         (Ord. 98-105. Passed 3-5-98.)
      (5)   If the overpayment or underpayment calculated by the Village
Administrator pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph is greater than
one thousand dollars ($1,000) or exceeds the Developer’s Estimate by more than
twenty percent (20%), then, in the event of an underpayment, the developer
shall pay the Village the shortfall and, in the event of an overpayment, the
Village shall refund the overpayment to the developer. Such refund, if made,
shall constitute the only refund of the Developer’s Estimate made by the
Village.
         (Ord. 01-155. Passed 1-3-02.)
      (6)   The determination by the Village Administrator of the project’s
average daily water usage during the second year shall constitute the project’s
Base Line Average Usage. In any subsequent year of operation, if the actual
average daily water usage exceeds the Base Line Average Usage by a factor of
twenty percent (20%), and the Impact Fee for that increased usage, using the
Impact Fee Factor then in effect would exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000),
the user may then be charged an additional Impact Fee, calculated by
multiplying the new average daily usage by the then applicable Impact Fee
Factor, and then reducing that product by the amount of the Impact Fee
previously paid. If an additional Impact Fee is charged as provided herein, the
newly- calculated average daily usage shall constitute the project’s new Base
Line Average Usage for purposes of future additional Impact Fee charges under
this paragraph.
   (e)   Council may, in its sole discretion, contribute from the General Fund
any part or all of the Impact Fee assessed against certain new development that
achieves other policies including, without limitation, the provision of single-
family housing, the retention of existing employment or the generation of new
employment.
   (f)   Prior to applying for a Zoning Certificate, an applicant may request a
non-binding Impact Fee estimate from the Village. The Village Administrator,
after consulting with the Zoning Inspector and the Village Engineer, shall make
a good faith estimate of the applicable Impact Fee, based upon the development
potential of the particular site, given the maximum use intensity permitted by
existing zoning.
(Ord. 98-105. Passed 3-5-98.)
913.05 TIME FOR PAYMENT.
   The Impact Fees assessed for a particular Development Project shall be paid
not later than the issuance of the Occupancy Permit, as provided by Chapter
1140. No Occupancy Permit shall be issued unless the applicable impact fee has
been paid.
(Ord. 04-142. Passed 12-16-04.)
913.06 ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTY.
   (a)   Charges are a Lien. Impact Fees charged pursuant to this Chapter are
hereby made a lien upon the premises of the Development Project. If such fees
are not paid within 30 days after the fees become due and payable, the Village
Administrator may certify the amount for such fees to the County Auditor. The
Auditor shall place same upon the tax duplicate together with all interest and
penalties allowed by law, and shall cause such amount to be collected as are
other municipal taxes. The effective date for such lien shall be the date of
certification to the County Auditor.
 
   (b)   Suspension of Plan Reviews and Application Processing. No plans or
other submittal documents shall be accepted for review and/or processing, and
the review of documents or processing of any application which is already in
progress shall cease, if the applicant has failed to pay any fees which are due
and payable to the municipality in accordance with this chapter.
 
   (c)   Other Enforcement Mechanisms. The Village, in its discretion, may use
all other measures available to it, including the revocation of a Zoning
Certificate, as provided by Section
1140.12 , and the shut-off of water services pursuant to the procedure in
Section
911.16 , to enforce Impact Fee payment obligations.
 
   (d)   Interest Rate on Unpaid Fees. Any Impact Fee due and owing the Village
shall bear interest at the highest rate allowable by law unless such amount is
paid within 30 days of the date the fee becomes due and payable, as provided by
Section
913.05 .
(Ord. 96-112. Passed 4-4-96.)
913.07 IMPACT FEE ACCOUNT.
   (a)   The Village Administrator shall establish an Impact Fee Account into
which all Impact Fees collected shall be deposited. The funds of the Impact Fee
Account shall not be co-mingled with other funds of the Village.
   (b)   The Impact Fee Account shall be interest-bearing and the accumulated
interest shall become part of the account.
(Ord. 96-112. Passed 4-4-96.)
913.08 USE OF IMPACT FEE PROCEEDS.
   (a)   Impact Fees may be expended only for Utility Capital Improvements, as
defined in this chapter, and to pay the principal, interest and other costs of
bonds, notes and other obligations issued or undertaken by or on behalf of the
Village to finance such improvements.
   (b)   The Village may issue bonds, revenue certificates and other
obligations of indebtedness in such manner and subject to such limitations as
may be provided by law in furtherance of Utility Capital Improvement projects.
Funds pledged toward retirement of bonds, revenue certificates, or other
obligations of indebtedness for such projects may include Impact Fees and other
Village revenues as may be allocated by Council. Impact Fees paid pursuant to
this chapter, however, shall be restricted to use solely and inclusively for
financing directly, or as a pledge against bonds, revenue certificates, and
other obligations of indebtedness, for the cost of Utility Capital Improvements
as specified in this chapter.
(Ord. 96-112. Passed 4-4-96.)
913.09 REFUNDS.
   (a)   Upon application of the property owner, the Village shall refund that
portion of any Impact Fee which has been on deposit more than five years and
which is both unexpended and uncommitted, except as described in subsection (b)
of this section. The refund shall be made to then-current owner or owners of
the lots or units of the Development Project.
   (b)   If fees in the Impact Fee Account are unexpended or uncommitted during
the fifth year, the fees are exempt from the refund provisions of subsection
(a) of this section if Village Council makes the following findings:
      (1)    A need for the capital improvement still exists;
      (2)    The fees will be used for an identified purpose; and
      (3)   The purpose for which the fees will be used is substantially
similar to the purpose for which the fees were collected.
   (c)   The Village may refund by direct payment, by offsetting the refund
against other Impact Fees due for a Development Project by the owner on the
same or other property, or by separate agreement acceptable to the owner and
the Village Council.
(Ord. 96-112. Passed 4-4-96.)
913.10 APPEALS.
   An owner or developer may appeal the amount of the fee imposed pursuant to
this Chapter by following the procedures set forth in this section.
   (a)   As a condition precedent to any appeal, the developer shall request an
audit to determine whether the Impact Fee imposed exceeds the amount reasonably
necessary to finance the Utility Capital Improvements attributable to the
Development Project. The Village Council shall then retain a qualified,
independent auditor who shall determine whether the fee is appropriate. The
Village shall require, as a condition of the audit, that the property owner
deposit with the Village a sum equal to the reasonable estimated cost of the
audit. In any event, the developer shall pay for the actual cost of the audit.
The decision of the independent auditor is final unless appealed to the Village
Council as provided by this section.
   (b)   Within ten days following the mailing of the notice of the auditor's
decision to the appellant, the owner, developer or other interested party,
including the Village, may challenge the result of the audit by filing with the
Fiscal Officer a written notice of appeal with a full statement of the grounds
for the appeal. The appellant shall pay an appeal fee of two hundred dollars
($200.00) unless the appellant is the Village, in which case said fee shall be
waived.
   (c)   If the appellant timely files a notice of appeal and pays the appeal
fee, as required by this section, and if the appellant posts a bond or other
security in an amount equal to the Impact Fee, the Village may continue
processing the development application.
   (d)   At a regular meeting following the filing of the appeal, the Village
Council shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and the Fiscal
Officer shall mail notice of the hearing to the appellant at the address given
in the notice of appeal.
      (1)    The hearing shall be conducted at the time and place stated in the
notice.
      (2)   The appellant shall bear the burden of demonstrating, by clear and
convincing evidence, that the amount of the fee at issue was not calculated
according to the procedures established in this Chapter.
      (3)   The determination of the Village Council shall be announced at the
conclusion of the hearing or, in the discretion of Council, at the next regular
meeting of the Council.
      (4)   The determination of the Village Council shall be final, subject
only to appeal pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
         (Ord. 96-112. Passed 4-4-96.)
913.11 LIMITATION OF ACTIONS.
   Any judicial action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, or annul the
reasonableness, legality or validity of any Impact Fee must be filed within 90
days following:
   (a)   The date of imposition of the fee, or
   (b)   The final determination of the Village Council as provided by Section
913.10, whichever is later.

913.12 VARIANCES AND EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   Petitions for variances and exceptions to the application of this
chapter to a particular Development Project shall be made in accordance with
the procedures established in Section
1113.03 of the Planning and Zoning Code.
 
   (b)   Any variance granted pursuant to this section shall, as an initial
matter, be a temporary variance, granted for a two-year period only.
 
   (c)   Two years after the issuance of the temporary variance, the Village
Administrator shall review the water used by the project during the preceding
year in order to determine the accuracy of any representations made by the
party requesting the variance, and the reasonableness and fairness of any
variance granted.
   (d)   As soon as reasonably possible after the Village Administrator
completes the water usage review, the Planning Commission shall reconsider the
granting of the temporary variance, and shall determine whether to allow that
variance to take effect permanently. The Planning Commission shall have the
authority, at that time, to recommend a permanent variance, to modify the
temporary variance and make that variance permanent, as modified, to grant a
new temporary variance to be reviewed again in two years, or to deny a variance
entirely.
 
   (e)   Any variance or exception whether temporary or permanent, shall not be
valid unless and until approved by an affirmative vote of not less than two-
thirds of the members of Village Council.
(Ord. 98-150. Passed 12-3-98.)
913.13 CREDITS.
   (a)   A property owner who dedicates land or otherwise contributes funds for
capital improvements as defined in this chapter may, in the discretion of the
Village Council, be granted a credit for such contribution against the Impact
Fee otherwise due.
 
   (b)   Any application for credit must be submitted on forms provided by the
Village before approval of the Development Project. The application shall
contain a declaration, under oath, of those facts which purport to qualify the
property owner for the credit, accompanied by all relevant documentary
evidence.
 
   (c)   The Village Engineer shall determine the value of the developer
contribution; whether the contribution meets the capital improvement needs for
which the Impact Fee has been imposed; and whether the contribution will
substitute or otherwise reduce the need for the capital improvements
anticipated to be funded by Impact Fee funds. In no event, however, shall the
credit exceed the amount of the otherwise applicable Impact Fee.
   (d)   A credit shall be afforded to the Development Project if the Council
approves such credit by a majority vote.

permissible uses of property, density of development, design and improvement
standards and requirements, or any other aspect regulating development of land
in the Village.
   (b)   Any Impact Fees established pursuant to this Chapter are in addition
to and are not intended to replace the sewer charges established by Chapter

estate or as soon as is practical to allow sufficient time for the Village
Administrator or his designee to determine the status of the water and sewer
charges.

Administrator, and copies shall be furnished, upon request, to any person
having a tenancy interest in the property.
      (2)    If the Village Administrator or his designee determines that the
applicant has not paid in full all billed water and sewer charges the applicant
will be given Transfer Certificate with a report in a form adopted by the
Village Administrator which indicates any water and sewer charges billed and
owed to the Village.

extreme hardship on the applicant; or
      (3)    Physical conditions make compliance impossible.

days of the filing of the notice of appeal. It shall render a written decision
at the close of the hearing or within seven days of the close of the evidence,

 1309.11;
      (6)   To authorize such variances from the terms of the Zoning Code as
will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to the special
conditions, a literal enforcement of the Zoning Code will result in practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardship;
      (7)   To authorize the substitution or extension of nonconforming uses,
as specified in Sections
1163.03 and
1163.04 of the Zoning Code;

other official action, all of which shall be a public record and be filed in
the Village Offices.
   (d)   Duties of the Zoning Inspector. It is the intent of this Zoning Code
that, except as specifically required otherwise by ordinance, all questions of
interpretation and enforcement shall first be presented to the Zoning
Inspector, and that such questions shall be presented to the Planning
Commission only on appeal from a decision of the Zoning Inspector, and that
recourse from the decisions of the Planning Commission shall be to the courts,

with the Zoning Inspector and with the Planning Commission, a notice of appeal
specifying the ground upon which the appeal is being taken.
   (b)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action

Commission, after the filing of the notice of appeal, that by reason of facts
stated in the application a stay would, in the opinion of the Zoning Inspector,

after notice to the Zoning Inspector, be granted by the Planning Commission or
by judicial proceedings.

the premises; and to that end, shall have all powers of the Zoning Inspector
from whom the appeal is taken.

Board has original jurisdiction under the Zoning Code.
(Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)

         (Ord. 08-117. Passed 9-4-08.)
   (c)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Housing Officer certifies to the Planning Commission
after the notice of appeal shall have been filed, that a stay would, in the
Housing Officer's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such
case, proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which
may, on due cause shown and after notice to the Housing Officer, be granted by
the Planning Commission or by judicial proceedings.
   (d)   The Planning Commission may, in conformity with the provisions of the
Codified Ordinances, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the

Officer, from whom the appeal is taken.
   (e)   The Planning Commission shall decide all appeals within ten days after
completion of the hearings thereon.
   (f)   All decisions of the Planning Commission on such appeals shall become

(Ord. 08-117. Passed 9-4-08; Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)
1101.04  VARIANCES.
   (a)   After being denied a zoning certificate by the Zoning Inspector, any
person owning or having an interest in property may file an application to
obtain a variance. An application for a zoning variance shall be filed in
triplicate with the Zoning Inspector on a form as specified for that purpose.
The Zoning Inspector shall forward a copy to the Planning Commission within ten
days of said filing.
   (b)   The application for a zoning variance shall contain the following
information:
      (1)   Name, address and phone number of the applicant.
      (2)   Legal description of property as recorded in Geauga County
Recorder’s Office.
      (3)   The specific provisions of the Zoning Code which apply.
      (4)   The use for which the variance is sought.
      (5)   Details of the variance for which application is made and the
grounds on which it is claimed that the variance should be granted.
      (6)   The specific reasons why the applicant believes the variance is
justified.
      (7)   The names and addresses of all property owners within 200 feet,
contiguous to and directly across the street from the property, as appearing on
the Geauga County Auditor’s current tax list.
   (c)   The Planning Commission shall have the power to authorize only those
variances from the provisions or requirements of the Zoning Code as will not be
contrary to the public interest, but only in the case of exceptional
conditions, involving irregular, narrow, shallow or steep lots, or other
exceptional physical conditions, whereby strict application of such provision
or requirements would result in practical difficulty and unnecessary hardship
that would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land and buildings
involved, but in no other case.
   (d)   Subject to the limitation specified by subsection (e) hereof, no
variance from the strict application of any provision of the Zoning Code shall
be granted by the Planning Commission unless it finds that all the following
facts and conditions exist:
      (1)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions generally created by the
provisions of the Zoning Code in the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located.
      (2)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of the Zoning Code and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      (3)   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
      (4)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
      (5)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
   (e)   In the specific case of an application for an “area variance” from the
provisions or requirements of the Zoning Code only if the Planning Commission
determines that “practical difficulties” exist, after considering and
evaluating the following factors:
      (1)   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or
whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance.
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial.
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance.
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services.
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction.
      (6)   Whether the property owner’s predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance.
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirements would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
   (f)   The Planning Commission shall act by motion and the concurring vote of
three members of the Planning Commission shall be necessary to grant any
variance from the requirements stipulated in the Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)
1101.05 PUBLIC HEARING AND DECISIONS BY THE BOARD.
   (a)   Provided required notices can first be given, the Planning Commission
shall hear all applications and appeals which were filed at least fourteen days
in advance of its scheduled meeting. Applications and appeals filed less than
fourteen days before the meeting shall be heard at the next regularly scheduled
Planning Commission meeting following the fourteen-day period. For good and
sufficient reason, the Planning Commission may waive this timing requirement.
The Planning Commission may also schedule a special hearing date in order to
expedite an application for an appeal or variance, provided that all notice and
other procedural requirements of applicable law are met.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall decide all applications and appeals
within ten days after completion of the hearings thereon.
   (c)   All decisions of the Planning Commission shall be made by motion and
shall be effective immediately unless determined otherwise by the Planning
Commission. Any such decision shall be binding upon and observed by the Zoning
Inspector. After the Planning Commission determines the application or appeal,
there shall be no further hearings upon such case.
   (d)   The Village and/or any party adversely affected by a decision of the
Planning Commission may appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Geauga County
within the time and upon the grounds as prescribed by law.
(Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)
1101.06 NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARING.
   (a)   The Planning Commission shall fix the time for the hearing and shall
give notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality
at least ten days before the date of such hearing. The notice shall set forth
the time and place of the public hearing and the nature of the proposed
variance.
   (b)   Written notice of such hearing shall be mailed by the Fiscal Officer,
by first class mail, at least ten days before the date of the hearing to all
parties of interest. The notice shall contain the same information as required
of the notice published in the newspaper and parties of interest shall include
owners of property within 200 feet from, contiguous to, and directly across the
street from the property being considered.
   (c)   A failure of delivery of notice to parties within 200 feet of the
property being considered shall not invalidate the decision of the Planning
Commission. However, if it is determined that the applicant failed to list a
property owner within the 200 feet, and that owner was not notified, then the
Planning Commission, in its discretion, may vote to vacate the decision and
require the applicant to resubmit his or her application.
   (d)   At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by attorney.
   (e)   Upon the day for hearing any application, the Planning Commission may
recess the hearing in order to permit additional information to be secured, or
to cause such further notice as it deems proper to be served upon such other
property owners as it decides may logically be concerned with such application
or appeal.
(Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)
1101.07 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting an appeal or variance, the Planning Commission may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards. When made a part of the terms under
which the appeal or variance is granted, such conditions and safeguards shall
be deemed a requirement of the Zoning Code and punishable thereunder. Under no
circumstances shall the Planning Commission grant an appeal or variance to
allow a use not permissible under the terms of the Zoning Code in the district
involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of the
Zoning Code in such district. (Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)
1101.08 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS PROCEDURE.
   Pursuant and subject to the provisions of Section
1159.07, upon application, the Planning Commission shall have the power to
issue a Zoning Certificate for potentially dangerous or objectionable uses as
identified in Section
1159.07, under the following procedure:
   (a)   Application. An application for a Zoning Certificate for a use subject
to said performance requirements shall be submitted in duplicate on a form
prescribed by the Planning Commission. The applicant shall also submit in
duplicate a plan of the proposed construction or development, including a
description of the proposed machinery, processes and products and
specifications for the mechanisms and techniques to be used in restricting the
emission of dangerous and objectionable elements as set forth in Section
 1159.07 in accordance with rules prescribed by the Board specifying the type
of information required in such plans and specifications. The fee for such
application shall include the cost of the special reports that may be required
to process it, as set forth in subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   Report by Expert Consultants. If, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, the proposed use may cause the emission of dangerous or
objectionable elements, the Planning Commission may refer for investigation and
report, the application to one or more expert consultants qualified to advise
as to whether a proposed use will conform to the applicable performance
standards specified in Section
1159.07. Such consultant or consultants shall report as promptly as possible
after receipt of such application. A copy of such report shall be promptly
furnished to the applicant.
   (c)   Review by Planning Commission. Within thirty days after the Planning
Commission has received the application, or the report if a report was
required, or within such further period as agreed to by the applicant, the
Planning Commission shall decide whether the proposed use will conform to the
applicable performance standards and on such basis shall authorize or refuse to
authorize issuance of a Zoning Certificate or require a modification of the
proposed plan of construction or specifications, proposed equipment or
operation. Any Zoning Certificate so authorized and issued shall be conditioned
upon, among other things:
      (1)   The applicant’s completed buildings and installations conforming in
operation to the applicable performance standards; and
      (2)   The applicant paying the fees for services of the expert
consultants deemed reasonable and necessary by the Planning Commission to
advise the Planning Commission as to whether or not the applicant’s completed
buildings and installation in operation will meet the applicable performance
standards.
   (d)   Continued Enforcement. The Zoning Inspector shall investigate any
purported violation of performance standards and if there are reasonable
grounds for the same, shall notify the Planning Commission of the occurrence or
existence of a probable violation thereof. The Planning Commission shall
investigate the alleged violation and for such investigation shall employ
qualified experts. If after public hearing on due notice, the Planning
Commission finds that a violation occurred or exists, a copy of such findings
shall be forwarded to Council for review and appropriate legal action thereon.
The services of any qualified experts employed by the Planning Commission to
advise in establishing a violation shall be paid by the violator if such
violation is established. If a violation is not established, the fee shall be
paid by the Village.
      (Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)
1101.09 INTERPRETATION OF ZONING MAP.
   Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as recorded,
differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the Zoning Map, the Planning
Commission, after notice to the owners of the property and after public
hearing, shall interpret the Map in such a way as to carry out the intent and
purpose of the Zoning Code. In case of any questions as to the location of any
boundary line between zoning districts, a request for interpretation of the
Zoning District Map may be made to the Planning Commission and the Planning
Commission shall make such determination.
(Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)

requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the Municipality and

statutes or exercised by home rule units.

conflict with one another or with the provisions of other ordinances or
regulations of the Municipality, the more restrictive provisions shall govern.

applicable to land development within the Municipality.
(Ord. 10-130. Passed 10-7-10.)

would place a disproportionate burden on public funds in supplying public
services.

existing provisions of law, ordinance, contract or deed, the provisions of the

1113.01  JURISDICTION.
   (a)    No person shall subdivide or lay out into lots any land within the
Municipality unless it be by plat complying with the Subdivision Regulations
contained herein, and no plat shall be recorded and no lot or land shall be
sold from any such plat until the final plat has been approved and recorded at
the County.
   (b)    No person shall circumvent the provisions of these Subdivision
Regulations by lease or by the sale of parcels, by metes and bounds.
   (c)    The design and layout of all subdivisions shall conform to the
requirements of the Village of Middlefield Design Regulations. The subdivider
shall make improvements and shall submit preliminary and final plans, all in
accordance with Chapter
1115 of the Subdivision Regulations.
   (d)    The division of a tract into five parcels or less fronting upon an
existing street and where the transfer is to be accomplished by the recording
of a deed rather than a plat, requires the approval of the Planning Commission
before it can be recorded. Such approval may be accomplished in the manner
provided in Section
1115.03.
   (e)   No zoning permit or occupancy permit shall be issued for any parcel or
plat of land which was created by subdivision after the effective date of, and
not in conformity with, the provisions of this chapter, and no excavation of
land or construction of any public or private improvements shall take place or
be commenced except in conformity with these regulations and other applicable
codes.
(Ord. 10-130. Passed 10-7-10.)
1113.02  AUTHORITY.
   (a)    Council and the Planning Commission by virtue of the provisions of
Ohio R. C. 711.10 and 711.101 are authorized, subject to the holding of
required public hearings, to adopt rules and regulations covering plats for
subdivisions of land and to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove plats
or subdivisions of land falling within their jurisdiction. Administration of
the rules and regulations contained herein shall be the responsibility of the
Planning Commission.
   (b)    The Planning Commission pursuant to Ohio R. C. Chapters 713 and 735,
or such statutes hereinafter in effect, may prepare plans for unsubdivided or
improperly subdivided areas to show a pattern of future streets and public open
spaces. After the required public hearing has been held, such plans or portions
thereof may be adopted by the Commission and recorded and thereafter no
subdivision may be approved and no street may be improved or accepted, except
that it conforms substantially to such recorded plan. No permit may be issued
for construction of a building or structure on land shown within the right of
way of any proposed future street until such right of way has been acquired or
reserved. However, such permit may not be withheld for more than ninety days of
such extended time as is mutually agreeable by the Municipality and the owner.
(Ord. 10-130. Passed 10-7-10.)  
1113.03  VARIANCE AND EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)    Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape
or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions such that the strict
application of the requirements of the Subdivision Regulations, including the
Design Regulations, would result in real difficulties, substantial hardship or
injustice, such requirements may be varied or modified so that the subdivider
may subdivide and install improvements on his property in another approved
manner, while at the same time, the public welfare and interest of the
Municipality and the surrounding area are thoroughly protected and the general
intent and spirit of the Regulations are enforced. The Planning Commission may
make recommendations of variations which may be permitted, but the authority
for approval of such variations shall rest with Council. Any Zoning Code
variance shall remain the sole jurisdiction of the Planning Commission pursuant
to this chapter. (Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)
   (b)    The requirements of the Regulations may also be modified and varied
whenever the scope of a plat encompasses a complete neighborhood or community,
but it is desirable any such plat conform to the Comprehensive Plan of the
Municipality. The Comprehensive Plan should be the guide for all future
development or redevelopment in the Municipality. Any variance requested must
insure that adequate public spaces, circulation, recreation, light and air will
be provided and the needs of the entire community when fully developed and
occupied will be fully met.
(Ord. 10-130. Passed 10-7-10.)
1113.04  AMENDMENTS.
   Council may, after public hearing, amend, supplement or change the
Subdivision Regulations. Notice shall be given of the time and place of such
public hearing by publication in at least one newspaper of general circulation
published in the local area, thirty days prior to holding of such hearing. The
amendment or amendments shall be on file in the office of the Planning
Commission for public inspection during such thirty days.
(Ord. 10-130. Passed 10-7-10.)
1113.05  SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of these
Subdivision Regulations is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by
any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate,
distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the
validity of the remaining portions hereof.
(Ord. 10-130. Passed 10-7-10.)
1113.06  PUBLIC HEARING.
   The Planning Commission, on its own initiative or upon petition by any
resident or neighboring property owner, may, prior to acting on a preliminary
plat of a subdivision, hold a hearing thereon at such time and upon such notice
as required by law.
(Ord. 10-130. Passed 10-7-10.)
 
1113.07 ADOPTION AND AMENDMENT OF DESIGN REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The Village Engineer shall prepare Village of Middlefield Design
Regulations to achieve the purposes set forth in this chapter, and shall
present the proposed Design Regulations to the Planning Commission for its
review and approval.
   (b)   The Design Regulations shall become effective upon their approval by a
majority of Planning Commission.

recommendations for approval or disapproval of the final plat to Council for
final action.
      (2)    The applicant shall be notified of the approval of the final plat
by the Planning Commission. The applicant shall then present the final plat to
Council for approval.
   (d)    Bonding.
      (1)   No final or official plat of any subdivision shall be approved
unless the applicant has filed with the Fiscal Officer of the Village a surety
bond, cashier's check, certified check or Performance Fund Agreement providing
for payment of one hundred percent of the cost of the installation
improvements, as determined by the Village's Engineer. Said security shall
guarantee to the Village of Middlefield that the improvements required by the
final plat will be constructed and completed in a satisfactory manner and
within a period specified by the Engineer, not to exceed two years. Upon (i)
satisfactory completion of the improvement, (ii) obtaining written approval of
same by the Engineer, (iii) presentation of waivers of mechanics’ liens by all
contractors, subcontractors, suppliers of materials and surveyors, (iv) payment
to the Village of all inspection fees or other fees incurred by the applicant,
the Fiscal Officer may release the bond, funds, or Performance Fund to the

         A.    In the event the applicant posts a performance bond, the form of
the bond shall be approved by the Solicitor. The bond shall be made payable to
and enforceable by the Village of Middlefield and shall require the applicant
and the applicant's heirs, successors and assigns to comply with all applicable
terms, conditions, provisions and requirements of the subdivision regulations
and as specified on the final plat.
         B.    If the applicant files with the Fiscal Officer a cashier's check
or certified check for one hundred percent of the installation cost of the
improvements, the applicant shall also provide written certification that the
funds are submitted pursuant to this section, and that the Village of
Middlefield is authorized to use these funds to complete the subdivision
improvements as required herein. The applicant shall also certify, on behalf of
the applicant and the applicant's heirs, successors, and assigns that the
applicant will comply with all applicable terms, conditions, provisions and
requirements of the subdivision regulations and as specified on the final plat.
         C.    The applicant may use a Performance Fund Agreement in
substitution of the performance bond or cash payment specified above only if
the terms of the Performance Fund Agreement are approved in writing by the
Solicitor and accepted by a motion adopted by a majority of the Council. No
such Performance Fund Agreement shall be approved unless it provides for all of
the following:
            1.    The Performance Fund Agreement must obligate a reputable
financial institution, with offices in Geauga County, Ohio, to the Village of
Middlefield for all of the applicant's guarantee obligations specified herein;
            2.   The Performance Fund Agreement must obligate the financial
institution to pay to the Village of Middlefield the entire disbursements which
the Village has, in writing, previously authorized, and thereafter permit the
Village to complete the construction of subdivision improvements using said
funds;
            3.   No funds shall be disbursed from the Performance Fund without
receipt by the financial institution of prior written approval from the
Village; and
            4.   The savings passbook, or other evidence of funds on deposit
with the financial institution, shall be maintained in the sole custody of the
Village's Fiscal Officer, pending completion of the subdivision improvements
and the release of those funds by the Village;
            5.   The Performance Fund Agreement shall be irrevocable by both
the applicant and the financial institution and shall inure solely to the
benefit of the Village of Middlefield.
If the applicant requests and the Village approves the use of a Performance
Fund, the Village may, but is not obligated, to authorize a partial release of
funds to pay for improvements as they are constructed. No such partial release
shall be permitted unless the Village's Engineer has certified that the work
for which the funds are being released has been performed and that the payment
will not reduce the balance of the Performance Fund below the reestimated
completion costs as of that date.
If the applicant requests and the Village of Middlefield approves the use of a
Performance Fund, the Village may, but is not obligated to allow for the amount
of the Performance Fund to be increased to cover the estimated cost of the
maintenance and operation of the improvements for two years after acceptance,
as provided more fully by subsection (f) hereof.
      (2)    When a portion of the improvements has been satisfactorily
completed and approved, based on an inspection of the Village's Engineer, a
reduction in the bonds, partial withdrawal of funds or reduction in the amount
of the Performance Fund may be authorized. However, such reduction shall not
reduce the balance of the bond below the re-estimated completion cost as of the
date of reduction and, further all other requirements of this section must have
been complied with.
      (3)    For a progressive installation development the developer may apply
for final approval and recording of only a portion of the entire subdivision.
Under such a progressive unit development procedure, the installation of
required improvements and sale or lease of lots may proceed only on that
portion of the subdivision which has been approved and recorded.
      (4)    In the event the applicant fails to complete the installation of
all improvements according to the subdivision regulations and as specified on
the final plat, the Municipality, upon notice to the applicant, may complete
same and appropriate such portion of the bonds, money or Performance Fund
posted for the performance of such work.
   (e)    Acceptance of Dedication.
      (1)   Upon completion of all improvements, including roads, grading,
culverts, seeding, mulching, monumentation and all other items required by the
Village, except sidewalks, the developer shall notify the Village Engineer by
letter that all improvements have been completed. The Engineer will then
schedule an inspection of the completed improvements. The developer or his
engineer shall accompany the Engineer or his representative on the inspection.
The procedure shall be repeated until such time that the Engineer determines
that all required improvements, excepting only sidewalks, have been
satisfactorily completed for acceptance in conformance with all applicable
regulations, specifications, and drawings.
      (2)    Upon satisfactory completion of all required improvements,
excepting only sidewalks, the Engineer will notify Council and will sign the
recorded plat to certify, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 711.091, that he has
inspected the construction and the condition of the streets and cul-de-sacs
dedicated to public use and that the improvements and facilities have met all
bonding requirements for completion.
      (3)    In the event the developer has completed installation of all
required sidewalks, the Engineer shall inspect them and if all sidewalks have
been constructed in accordance with applicable ordinances and regulations of
the Village and with the specifications set forth on the plan, the Engineer
shall notify Council.
      (4)    In the event that the developer has not completed installation of
all required sidewalks, the Engineer shall determine the estimated cost to the
Village of completing the installation of all required sidewalks in the
subdivision. Prior to taking action to accept dedication of the improvements as
authorized by this section, the Village shall require the developer to post a
bond or performance fund, in the full amount of the estimated cost of said
sidewalk improvements.
      (5)    Upon satisfaction of the foregoing requirements, and in
conformance with Section
723.03 of the Revised Code, the Municipality may take legislative action to
accept the improvements for public dedication.
      (6)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the developer
shall install all required sidewalks no later than three years following the
initial filing of the subdivision plat unless the Planning Commission within
its discretion, shall determine that there is good cause to extend said
deadline.
   
   (f)    Provisions for Maintenance and Operation.
      (l)    Where the subdivision contains sewers, sewage treatment plants,
water supply systems, park areas, street trees or other facilities, necessary
or desirable for the welfare of the area and which are of common use or benefit
and which are of such character that the Municipality, county or other public
agency does not desire to maintain them, then provisions shall be made by trust
agreements, which are a part of the deed restrictions and which are acceptable
to the Planning Commission for the proper and continuous maintenance and
supervision of such facilities by the lot owners in the subdivision.
      (2)    Upon completion of the improvements, excepting only sidewalks, and
before Council will accept for dedication the subdivision roads or release the
performance fund to guarantee the installation of sidewalks, the developer
shall provide a maintenance bond or Maintenance Fund Agreement with cash or
certified check to Council in the amount of fifteen percent (15%) of the total
cost of the improvements, unless, for good cause, a greater or lesser amount is
recommended by the Engineer and approved by the Planning Commission.
         A.    The developer may use a Maintenance Fund agreement in
substitution of the performance bond or cash payment specified above only if
the terms of the Maintenance Fund Agreement are approved in writing by the
Solicitor and accepted by a motion adopted by a majority of the Council. No
such Maintenance Fund Agreement shall be approved unless it provides for all of
the following:
            1.   The Maintenance Fund Agreement must obligate a reputable
financial institution, with offices in Geauga County, Ohio, to the Village of
Middlefield for all of the applicant's guarantee obligations specified herein;
            2.   The Maintenance Fund Agreement must obligate the financial
institution to pay to the Village of Middlefield the entire disbursements which
the Village has, in writing, previously authorized, and thereafter permit the
Village to maintain the construction of subdivision improvements using said
funds;
            3.   No funds shall be disbursed from the Maintenance Fund without
receipt by the financial institution of prior written approval from the
Village; and
            4.   The savings passbook, or other evidence of funds on deposit
with the financial institution, shall be maintained in the sole custody of the
Village's Fiscal Officer, pending completion maintenance period and the release
of those funds by the Village;
            5.   The Maintenance Fund Agreement shall be irrevocable by both
the developer and the financial institution and shall inure solely to the
benefit of the Village of Middlefield.
         B.    The developer may provide a Maintenance Fund that is a
combination of a contractor's maintenance bond (providing for maintenance and
repair of improvements due to defects in materials and workmanship) combined
with a Maintenance Fund, provided that:
            1.   Said combination fulfills the guarantee required by Section
1115.02(1)(2).
            2.   The amount of the guarantee equals or exceeds the amount
required by this section.
            3.   Said arrangement is approved by Council.
      Where Council has accepted a combination guarantee, Council, in its
discretion, may but shall not be obligated to accept a personal guarantee from
the individual developer or, if the developer is a corporation or partnership,
from the owners or partners of said entity, in lieu of a Maintenance Fund. as
long as the developer's obligation to repair and maintain the improvements is
fully guaranteed as required by Section
1115.02(f)(3).
      (3)    The maintenance bond or Maintenance Fund will guarantee that the
developer will maintain the road and related improvements, except for snow and
ice removal, for two years and that the developer will restore the road and
related improvements, if determined necessary by the Municipal Engineer at the
end of the two years.
      (4)    If the developer fails to perform the maintenance and restoration
items, Council will authorize the Engineer to have the work performed. The cost
of this work will be deducted from the maintenance bond or the Maintenance
Fund. The developer will be held liable for any expenditure over and above the
maintenance bond or Maintenance Fund.
      (5)    After all maintenance and restoration work has been completed to
the satisfaction of the Engineer, Council will return the maintenance bond or
Maintenance Fund or that portion remaining to the developer.
   (g)    Recording of Final Plat. After the final plat has been approved by
the Planning Commission and Council, the appropriate bonds have been provided
and the necessary approvals endorsed in writing thereon, together with evidence
of title, the developer shall cause the final plat as approved by the Planning
Commission and Council to be recorded in the office of the Geauga County
Recorder no later than thirty days after the date of approval unless an
extension is agreed to by Council. The applicant shall furnish Council with a
reproducible copy on permanent reproducible material of the recorded plan.
Failure to record on time may cause the final plan to be declared null and void
by Council.
   (h)    Approval and Recording of Condominium Plat. Once the final plat has
been
approved by the Planning Commission and Council, and the Planning Commission
has approved a site plan for an expandable condominium, where a developer of an
expandable condominium requires the subsequent approval and filing of plats to
facilitate land transfers within the expandable condominium ("Condominium
Transfer Plats"), and where such Condominium Transfer Plats are consistent with
the approved site plan and the final approved plat for the lot, the recording
of such Condominium Transfer Plats may be approved by the Chairman of the
Planning Commission, provided that the Village Engineer has first verified that
the Condominium Transfer Plat is consistent, in all material respects, with the
final approved site plan and the final approved plat. (Ord. 10-114. Passed 7-1-
10.)
1115.03 LOT SPLITS.
   (a)    A tract which fronts upon an existing public street may be divided
into five or fewer parcels by the recording of a deed rather than a plat if and
only if the applicant complies with the provisions of this section.
   (b)    The party or parties desiring to make the transfer provided by this
section shall submit a sketch thereof to the Planning Commission. After review,
and if the proposed division conforms to all applicable standards, the Planning
Commission may approve the lot split. The Planning Commission may condition
such approval upon any conditions which it deems necessary.
   (c)    If the proposed lot split is approved by the Planning Commission, the
applicant shall submit for each new parcel being created or left in residue, an
accurate and current survey description that shall be prepared by a
professional surveyor registered with the State of Ohio and in accordance with
the following.
      (1)   Professional Land Surveyors of Ohio publication "Minimum Standards
for Boundary Surveys in the State of Ohio"
      (2)   The Conveyance Standards for Geauga County
      (3)   The requirements of the "MUNICIPAL STANDARDS FOR PLAN CONTENT"
along with a deed to the Village Engineer, setting forth the division of the
tract into parcels. If the Village Engineer determines that the deed is in
conformance with the transfer approved by the Planning Commission, he shall
forward it to the Chairman of the Planning Commission. The Chairman of the
Planning Commission shall stamp the deed "Approved, No Plat Required" and
attach his signature, and the deed may then be recorded.
   (d)   ln the event the applicant has proposed a split of one lot for the
purpose of consolidating or combining one of the newly-created lots with an
adjacent existing lot, in addition to the foregoing, the applicant shall also
prepare a deed consolidating the newly- created lot with the adjacent existing
lot and submit that deed to the Village Engineer for approval. The Planning
Commission may condition the approval of a lot split upon the requirement that
the applicant record both the deed dividing the lot and the consolidation deed
described in this subsection.
   (e)    No lot split shall be approved where any of the parcels remaining
does not meet the requirements of the Village of Middlefield Design Regulations
or Section
1155.01 of the Codified Ordinances, or any other applicable section of the
Subdivision or Zoning Codes. (Ord. 10-114. Passed 7-1-10.)
   (f)    Road Frontage:
      (1)   In all Residential Zoning Districts, no lot split shall be approved
where any of the parcels remaining does not have frontage on an existing public
street.
      (2)   In non-Residential Zoning Districts only. The Planning Commission,
in its discretion and with the approval of Council. may approve a lot split
where one or more of the parcels remaining does not have frontage on a public
street, but only where all of the following apply:
         A.   All parcels created by the lot split must have frontage either on
a public street or on a privately-owned roadway capable of handling, as
applicable, commercial or industrial traffic (the "Private Road");
         B.   The Private Road must be part of one (and only one) of the
parcels existing following the lot split (the "Private Road Parcel");
         C.   The party seeking the lot split shall record a document (i)
granting a perpetual roadway and utility use easement in the Private Road to
all parcels created by the lot split: (ii) obligating the owner of the Private
Road Parcel and that owner's successors and assigns to maintain the Private
Road, and (iii) making clear that said obligations may be enforced by any of
the owners of the parcels created by the lot split;
         D.   Prior to approving the lot split, the Planning Commission shall
determine that requiring the Private Road to be dedicated as a public street
would not be be economically feasible and would hinder the economic development
of the parcels being created:
         E.   All other requirements of Section 1115.03 must be met; and
         F.   The Planning Commission may condition the granting of a lot split
on a Private Road upon any other terms and conditions which the Planning
Commission deems appropriate.
            (Ord. 16-115. Passed 7-14-16.)
   (g)    No lot split shall be approved where, in the discretion of the
Planning Commission, it appears that the purpose of the lot split is to reduce
the size of the parcel in order to circumvent requirements applicable to large
lot/multiple unit developments in the R- PUD and R-3 residential districts.
   (h)    Prior to approving the recording of any deed effecting a lot split,
the Planning Commission shall verify that each lot involved in the lot split
has iron pins placed at its corners. Such verification shall be made in the
same manner as required by Section
1140.01(c)(2).
   (i)    Provided that the applicant otherwise complies with the requirements
of this section, the applicant shall not be required to submit preliminary or
final subdivision plans or documents other than those described in this
section, and none of the improvements described in Chapter
1119 shall be required prior to transfer.
   (j)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, lot splits are prohibited in the C-PUD
Planned Unit Commercial Development District unless such lot splits are
approved by the Planning Commission and Council as part of a Development Plan
or an amendment thereto, as provided by Section
1153.097.

      (5)   Failure to waive the requirement at issue would tend to deny the
property owner a substantial and economically viable use of the property.
   (n)    In reviewing each site plan, the Planning Commission shall consider
any traffic congestion which may result from or be increased by the approval of
the proposed project, and shall take steps necessary to make certain that the
approved site plan causes or increases the least amount of traffic congestion
feasible under the circumstances.

building or structure erected on or after November 1, 2004, unless and until an
Occupancy Permit therefor has been issued by the Zoning Inspector and posted on
the premises.
   (c)   Alteration of Buildings or Structures.
      (1)    No person shall occupy or use any building or structure that, on

   (d)    Existing Buildings. Upon written request from the owner of an
existing building or structure, the Zoning Inspector shall issue a Occupancy
Permit for that building or structure, provided there are no violations of the
Zoning Code or the Building Code, and provided further that the applicant
establishes that the current occupancy of the building or structure existed
prior to November 1, 2004 and that said occupancy was in compliance with the

requirements:
      (1)    The applicant shall demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Inspector, that the project conforms to all applicable zoning codes, zoning
permits, and, if applicable, the approved site plan, and that the building or

serving the lot upon which the building or structure is erected have been
installed to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector; and
         B.   Verify that the lot upon which the building or structure is
erected has existing iron pins located at the corners of that lot as designated
on the final plat and as required by Section 1115.03(e) by requiring the
applicant to submit:

Temporary Occupancy Permit before the completion of the entire work covered by
the permit, provided that such building, structure or portion or portions can
be occupied safely prior to full completion of the building, structure or
portion without endangering health, safety or public welfare.
      (2)   The Temporary Occupancy Permit shall be issued for a limited period
of time, which shall be determined by the Zoning Inspector. The Zoning
Inspector may extend that expiration date for good cause shown.
      (3)   In issuing a Temporary Occupancy Permit for new construction, the
Zoning Inspector may issue a permit for a temporary water connection as
provided by Section
911.06.
      (4)   In issuing a Temporary Occupancy Permit, the Zoning Inspector shall
set a deadline by which the work will be completed and a date of expiration of
the Temporary Occupancy Permit based on that deadline.
      (5)   Prior to the issuance of a Temporary Occupancy Permit, the
applicant shall deposit funds with the Municipality, in an amount determined by
the Zoning Inspector. In appropriate circumstances, and at the discretion of
the Zoning Inspector with the consent of the Village Administrator, the
Municipality will accept a performance bond in lieu of a cash deposit of funds.
      (6)   The amount of the deposit or performance bond shall be sufficient
to cover the costs of all required work which is (i) not yet complete and (ii)
necessary for the issuance of the final Occupancy Permit.
      (7)   Upon expiration of the Temporary Occupancy Permit, if the work is
required by the zoning permit and, if applicable, the approved site plan has
not been completed, the Municipality may (i) apply the monetary deposit or
utilize the performance bond to correct any deviations from the zoning permit
or the approved plans; or, (ii) withhold such deposit or release of the
performance bond until such time as the correction or compliance is made; and/
or (iii) apply any funds on deposit toward the costs incurred by the
Municipality in instituting legal proceedings in the pursuit of site
compliance.
      (8)   Upon the failure of the owner to timely make such repairs or
replacements, the Village Administrator, may, in his or her discretion, (i)
utilize the deposit or the performance bond to contract for independent
services to have the required work performed and (ii) pay the costs and
expenses thereof out of the funds so deposited or cause the surety to make such
payment. Any such costs and expenses that exceed the amount on deposit or
covered by the performance bond shall be paid immediately by the owner and,
absent such payment, the Temporary Occupancy Permit shall be revoked.
      (9)   Upon completion of the work, the owner shall notify the Zoning
Inspector thereof, and request that the Zoning Inspector make a final
inspection of the premises. Upon final approval and issuance of the Occupancy
Permit, the deposit shall be returned, less any and all costs incurred by the
Municipality for inspection and approval.
      (10)    If funds deposited with the Municipality pursuant to this section
remain on deposit for three (3) years after a final inspection, or if after
three (3) years the conditions required for the refunding of such deposit or
balance thereof have not been satisfied, such deposit shall be deemed forfeited
and shall be transferred to the General Fund.
   (h)    Occupancy Permit Regulations. The Zoning Inspector shall promulgate
Occupancy Permit regulations consistent with this Section which shall become
effective upon approval by the Planning Commission. Such regulations shall set
forth the information to be included with an application for an occupancy
permit, a schedule of fees for occupancy permit applications, and a list of
standard deposits. The list of standard deposits shall include set fees for
driveways, sidewalks, grading, landscaping, etc. However, such list shall not
be exclusive and the Zoning Inspector shall have the discretion to establish
specific deposit amounts, when warranted, on a case-by-case basis.
   (i)   Revocation of Occupancy Permit. In addition to the remedies available
under Sections
1140.12 and
1140.13, the Zoning Inspector shall, in writing, suspend or revoke an Occupancy
Permit issued under the provisions of the Zoning Code wherever the permit is
issued in error, or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or where it
is determined that the building or structure or portion thereof is in violation
of any ordinance or regulation applicable thereto.
   (j)   Escrow Agent Restrictions. No person, firm or corporation acting in
the capacity of an escrow agent in any real estate transaction involving the
sale of any premises located within the Municipality shall disburse any funds
or finalize any transfers of property in the Municipality on or after November
1, 2004, unless evidence of a valid Occupancy Permit or a statement by the
Zoning Inspector that no Occupancy Permit is required for the real estate at
issue has first been deposited into the escrow.

1151.01  INTENT.
   The following zoning districts are hereby established for the Village of
Middlefield, Ohio. For the interpretation of this Ordinance, the zoning
districts have been formulated to realize the general purposes as set forth in
the preamble of this Ordinance. In addition, the purpose of each zoning
district shall be as follows:
   (a)    R-1 Single- Family Residential. This district is established to
accommodate single-family residential dwellings at a density that is similar to
that which already exists in the area so defined. The objective of this
district is to discourage large concentrations of intensive development where
it is desirable to maintain the character of the area.
   (b)    R-1A Moderate Density Single Family Residential. This district is
established to accommodate single-family residential dwellings at a density
somewhat greater than that which exists in the R-l district. The objective of
this district is to encourage the development of affordable housing without
degrading the quality or aesthetics of that housing.
   (c)    R-2 Two-Family Residential. This district is established to
accommodate two- family residential dwellings at a density that is similar to
that which already exists in the area so defined. The objective of this
district is to discourage large concentrations of intensive development where
it is desirable to maintain the character of the area.
   (d)    R-3 Multiple Family Residential. This district is established to
accommodate multi-family dwellings and townhouses at a density compatible to
that already existing in the areas so defined. The objective of this district
is to allow continuance, redevelopment or limited expansion of existing
apartments in areas appropriate for such development and to allow for a choice
of dwelling structure types and densities.
(Ord. 91-124. Passed 8-5-91.)
   (e)   SR Senior Residential District. The SR District is established in
recognition of the special nature of the housing needs of senior citizens and
to enable senior citizens to obtain suitable, safe, sanitary and decent housing
designed to meet their special needs, including reduced dwelling size,
assistance in housekeeping, availability of essential amenities and the
development of a community atmosphere to reduce feelings of alienation.
   (f)    GC General Commercial District. The General Commercial District is
intended to encourage the concentration of a broad range of individual
commercial establishments which together may constitute an area of general
commercial activity. Activities in this district are generally large space
users offering a wide range of goods and services. Strip development shall be
discouraged. GC Districts shall be located on Major Thoroughfares.
   (g)    CB Central Business District. The Central Business District is
intended to accommodate and encourage the further expansion and renewal of the
historical core business area as a convenient and attractive place for a wide
range of retail and businesses, residential, professional, and public uses, in
a setting conducive to and safe for a high volume of pedestrian traffic.
   (h)    I Industrial District. The Industrial District is established to
provide areas for necessary industria1 expansion and related uses in such a
manner so that those uses do not create serious problems for other land uses in
the community.
   (i)   I-O Industrial Office District. The Industrial Office District is
intended to provide a transition zone between Industrial and Residential
Districts, in accordance with Section
1153.06 . It is the further objective of this District to promote and maintain
an attractive setting with grass, trees and shrubbery versus the stark
plainness of an industrial manufacturing building and to be aesthetically and
otherwise compatible to existing neighboring residential development and to
keep the traffic impact to a minimum.
   (j)   R-PUD Planned Unit Residential Development. The R-PUD District is
established to permit a variety of dwelling unit types and provide greater
design flexibility and housing diversity within an area than would normally be
developed through conventional zoning districts.
      (Ord. 91-124. Passed 8-5-91.)
   (k)   I-PUD Planned Unit Industrial Development. The I-PUD District is
established to permit a variety of industrial uses and provide greater design
flexibility that would normally be permitted in an industrial district, so that
the potential adverse impact of industrial uses on nearby non-industrial uses
can be minimized.
(Ord. 97-112. Passed 5-15-97.)
   (l)   C-PUD Planned Unit Commercial Development. The C-PUD District is
established to permit a planned commercial district, with rezoning to that
district premised upon the existence of an enforceable, negotiated development
plan which includes the layout of all site features (including buildings and
other structures), planned uses, locations of permitted access points, parking
and drives, landscaping, storm water management and architectural standards.
      (Ord. 01-139. Passed 11-15-01; Ord. 08-108. Passed 5-2-08.)
1151.02 ANNEXATION.
   (a)   Upon any territory being annexed to the Municipality, the area so
annexed shall be considered to be zoned to the most restrictive district under
the terms of the Zoning Ordinance, which district is the R-1, Single Family
Residential District. Within thirty days after the acceptance of the annexed
territory, the Planning Commission shall study the area so annexed relative to
the recommended use of the land as shown upon the Middlefield Comprehensive
Plan and make such recommendations to Council as are deemed proper. If these
recommendations include proposed zone changes, Council shall advertise and hold
a public hearing according to the amendment procedures in Chapter
1137 . In any event, the period of time for action necessary to accommodate a
zone change, if required, shall not exceed ninety days by Council or 120 days
by the Commission and Council from the date of the annexation acceptance.
   (b)   Prior to accepting annexation of any territory to the Municipality,
the Council shall consider the following factors:
      (1)   All factors relating to utility impacts of the proposed annexation
territory on the Municipality, as more fully provided by Section
901.01  of the Codified Ordinances;
      (2)   Whether the annexation petition is consented to by all of the
owners in the territory to be annexed;
      (3)   Whether the territory proposed for annexation exceeds 500 acres;
      (4)   Whether the length of the boundary between the territory proposed
for annexation and the Municipality is at least five percent of the length of
the perimeter of the entire territory proposed for annexation;
      (5)   Whether the annexation will create an unincorporated area of the
Township that is completely surrounded by the Municipality;
      (6)   Whether the annexation, if accepted, will divide or segment an
existing street or road, and, if so, whether there exists an agreement between
the Township and the Municipality regarding the maintenance of that segment of
street or road; and
      (7)   Whether the territory is being annexed for the purpose of
undertaking a “significant economic development project” within the meaning of
Section 709.024 of the Revised Code.

unit types and provide greater design flexibility and housing diversity within
an area than would normally be developed through conventional zoning districts.
To achieve the intent of this District, the regulations permit departure from
strict application of standard provisions such as lot areas, yard requirements
and building spacing to encourage a more wholly designed and unified
development, a more flexible arrangement of buildings in relationship to open
space and preservation and effective utilization of existing natural features.
      (2)    In return for more flexible design standards and development
opportunities, the developer submits to a more detailed review of plans prior
to issuance of a zoning certificate to assure appropriate development of the
designated area and to assure compatibility with the surrounding land uses and
environmental amenities.
       (3)    The gross development density is established to provide
sufficient incentive to encourage unified development and preservation of
natural features.

located as to optimize privacy and aesthetic quality without encroaching upon
required automobile sight distances. Natural wooded areas shall be preserved to
the greatest extent possible.
      (2)    Grading. Except where unavoidable, grading for building site
preparation, street, sidewalk and utilities construction shall be limited.
      (3)    Development layout. Dwelling units shall be grouped or clustered
so as to break up the development arrangement, maximize privacy, collect and
maximize the common open space and promote the individual character and
coordinated layout of each lot, cluster and grouping. Streets and cul- de-sacs
shall be laid out so as to utilize natural contours and discourage through and
high traffic, except on collector or arterial streets. Utilities shall be
placed underground. Street lighting shall be provided.

Three or more          720
      (5)   Circulation.
         A.    The vehicular circulation system and parking facilities should
be designed to fully accommodate the automobile with safety and efficiency
without permitting it to dominate and destroy the form of the area. Driveways
for group developments and local streets should be placed at locations where
the traffic can be controlled and operated effectively with the minimum
interference to the capacity and flow on the existing streets.
         B.    The pedestrian circulation shall be designed through an
interconnecting walkway system to promote easy and direct barrier free access
to all areas of the development.
         C.    Whenever possible, the vehicular and pedestrian circulation
patterns shall be completely separate and independent from one another.
         D.    Street and sidewalk alignments, and the alignments for any
utilities shall be parallel to contours, in valleys or on ridges where
possible, in common open areas and as permitted by the Planning Commission in

of the final development plan along with a report of the action of Council.
          L.    Progressive Development. The Planning Commission and/or Council
may allow a developer to accomplish the development of the planned unit
development district in progressive stages. When the final plan of the
development area provides for partial development of the total area for which a
preliminary plan has been approved, the Planning Commission may require
detailed plans for all improvements in the development area to permit
evaluation of the development of the entire parcel before development in
progressive stages may be approved.
         M.    Amendments. At any time after approval of a preliminary
development plan or a final development plan of a development area, the owner
or owners may request an amendment of their plans, the request of such
amendment shall be filed with the Planning Commission and one copy filed with
the Fiscal Officer. If the amendment is in substantial agreement with the
approval of the preliminary plan or final plan of a development area, it shall
be processed by the Planning Commission. Should the amendment represent a
departure from the intent of a prior approval, the amendment shall then be
subject to the same procedure and conditions of approval as the original
application.
           N.    Enforcement of Development Schedule. 
             1.    The Zoning Inspector shall periodically review all the
permits issued for the planned unit development, examine all the construction
that has taken place within the development area and compare actual development
with the approved development area schedule. If the Zoning Inspector finds that
the owner or developer of property in the planned unit development district has
failed to meet the approved development schedule, or that the rate at which
common open space is being constructed or reserved as provided, he shall
forward this information to the Planning Commission. In such case, the
developer shall be informed in writing of the Zoning Inspector's finding and,
if the violation seems to be flagrant, continuous and potentially damaging, the
developer shall be ordered to cease and desist until a review has been
completed as set forth herein.
            2.    The Planning Commission shall within thirty days conduct a
hearing giving fifteen days notice previously thereto, to the owner or
developer for the purpose of determining whether or not the limits of the
development schedule should be extended for a reasonable time. After making a
determination as set forth herein, the Planning Commission shall forward such
determination to Council.
            3.    Council may affirm, reverse or modify the determination of
the Planning Commission and shall communicate its decision to the Planning
Commission, and the owner or developer.
      O.   Failure to begin development. If no above-ground building
construction has begun in the planned unit development district within the time
stated in the development and construction schedule, the final development plan
shall lapse upon written notice to the owner or developer from the Planning
Commission and shall be of no further effect. For good cause shown, the
Planning Commission may extend the time or times for the beginning of
construction called for in the development or construction schedule, not to
exceed one year from the dates set forth in such schedule. If a final
development plan lapses under the provisions of this section, the plan becomes
null and void and all permits shall be revoked.
 
1153.095 I-PUD PLANNED UNIT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose. The I-PUD District permits a variety of industrial uses and
provides greater flexibility within a given zoning district than would normally
occur under standard industrial zoning. The regulations for this district
permit departure from strict application of the requirements in the Industrial
district to encourage a more flexible arrangement of buildings and open spaces
in order to avoid the potential adverse impact of the industrial uses on nearby
non-industrial uses.
 
   (b)   Plan Review. In return for more flexible design standards and
development opportunities, the developer submits to a more detailed review of
plans prior to the issuance of a zoning certificate, to assure appropriate
development of the designated area and to assure compatibility with the
surrounding land uses and environmental amenities.
 
   (c)   Uses Permitted. A building or lot in the I-PUD District shall be used
only for the uses permitted in the Industrial District pursuant to Section
1153.06 (a).
 
   (d)   Conditional Uses. The following uses shall be allowed only as
conditional uses, in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code:
      (1)   Uses that the Planning and Zoning Commission, as part of the site
plan review, determines are compatible with uses that are permitted in the I-
PUD District. If the Planning Commission determines that a proposed conditional
use is compatible with other uses in the district, the applicant may then apply
for a conditional use permit pursuant to the standards and procedures set forth
in Chapter
1135.
 
   (e)   Maximum Density. The maximum aggregate density of primary structures
in a I-PUD zoning district shall not exceed 0.5 structures per acre in the
district.
 
   (f)   Site Plan Review and Approval. In addition to the requirements of
Section
1140.06  regarding site plan review, the developer shall submit the following:
      (1)   A Preliminary Plan, in general conformance with the standards
specified by Section
1153.09(h)(2)(B);
      (2)   A Traffic Impact Evaluation, in general conformance with the
standards specified by Section
1153.09(h)(9);
      (3)   A Utility Impact Evaluation, in general conformance with the
standards specified by Section

required by subsection (f), above, shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission
in consultation with the Village Solicitor and the Village Engineer, in such
manner as the Planning Commission deems fit and appropriate. If the Planning
Commission approves the Preliminary Plan, it shall forward its recommendation
to Council for further action.
 
   (h)   Council Action. Within sixty days of the date upon which the Planning
Commission recommends approval of a Preliminary Plan, unless such time is
extended by Council for good cause, Council shall consider whether the Planning
Commission recommendation should be approved, conditionally approved, or
disapproved. Within five days after the Council action, the Fiscal Officer
shall notify the developer of such action.
 
   (i)   Final Plan of Development. Within 180 days of the date upon which
Council approves the Preliminary Plan, unless such time period is extended by
the Planning Commission for good cause, the developer shall submit a Final
Development Plan. In no event shall the Planning Commission permit an extension
of time for submission of the Final Development Plan beyond one year from the
date upon which Council approves the Preliminary Plan. Failure on the part of
the developer to submit the Final Development Plan within the time period
allowed herein shall result in automatic revocation of said approval and render
the approvals of the Preliminary Plan void and of no effect.
 
   (j)   Submission of Final Plan. The developer shall submit to the Planning
Commission a Final Development Plan by filing six copies thereof with the
Zoning Inspector. The Final Development Plan shall be in general conformance
with the standards specified by Section
1153.09 (h)(H).
 
   (k)   Action on Final Plan. Within sixty days after the submission of the
Final Development Plan, unless such time period is extended by the Planning
Commission for good cause, the Planning Commission shall make its
recommendation to Council, approving the Final Plan, conditionally approving
the Final Plan, or disapproving the Final Plan.
 
   (l)   Required Findings. Prior to approving or conditionally approving the

notify the developer of Council’s action on the Final Development Plan by
certified mail.
 
   (n)   Amendments. At any time after approval of the Final Development Plan,
the developer may request an amendment of said plan from the Planning
Commission. If the amendment is in substantial conformity to the approved Final
Development Plan, the Planning Commission may, in its discretion, approve the
amendment. In the event the proposed amendments is not in substantial
conformity with the approved Final Development Plan, said amendment must be
approved both by the Planning Commission and by Council.
 
    (o)   Enforcement of Development Plan. The Zoning Inspector shall
periodically review all zoning permits issued for the Industrial Planned Unit
Development and all construction that takes place within the development area.
If the Zoning Inspector finds that the construction is not in substantial
conformity with the approved Final Development Plan, the Zoning Inspector is
empowered to take any and all appropriate action, including revocation of the
zoning permit.

(Ord. 08-108. Passed 5-2-08.)
1155.02  FRONT YARDS.
   (a)    The front yard depth shall be measured from the right-of-way line of
the existing street on which the lot fronts provided there is a minimum right-
of-way of sixty (60) feet. In the case where the right-of-way is less than (60)

the centerline of the street.
 
   (b)    In any R-District where a block has fifty (50) percent of the lot
frontage on one side of the street improved with buildings, and the average
depth of the front yards of said existing buildings along the entire block
front, excluding corner lots, is less than the front yard depth prescribed
elsewhere in this Ordinance, the required depth of the front yards shall be
modified, provided, however, there are two (2) or more front yards of existing
buildings involved. In such cases, the required front yard in question shall be
the average depth of existing front yards provided, further, that said front
yard shall be at least twenty (20) feet.
 
   (c)    Lots having frontage on more than one street shall provide the
required front yard along the major traveled street and meet two-thirds of the

(Ord. 85-107. Passed 3-4-85.)
 
   (h)    Off-street parking may not be located within the required side or
front yard in any Industrial Office District. However, the Planning and Zoning
Commission may grant a variance from this provision, as long as the sixty feet
of green area set back from the road right of way is adhered to, and
appropriate mounds, hedges or other landscaping is provided so as to shield any
cars from the view of the adjacent residential development, and it is found
that front parking provides the best site plan with the least impact on the
adjacent residential areas.

for both ingress and egress. (See Section
1157.03(g).) The Planning and Zoning Commission may also require the applicants
of adjacent I-O District developments to share a common driveway at an abutting
boundary, and may also require an applicant to make provision for the
dedication of land or easements for a marginal road or common driveway and curb
cuts, and if this is required, appropriate joint easements containing
provisions for maintenance shall be submitted together with the site plan.
(Ord. 86-134. Passed 3-2-87.)

way of sixty (60) feet. In the case where the right- of-way is less than sixty
(60) feet, the side yard width shall be measured from a point thirty (30) feet
from the centerline of the street.
 
   (b)    No accessory building shall project into a required side yard
abutting on a street or be closer than eight (8) feet to any side lot line of

side yard. If the wall is a retaining wall, the height shall be measured on the
highest (fill) side. No fence, trees, or foliage shall be maintained on a lot
that will materially obstruct the view of a driver of a vehicle as provided in
Section
1155.08.

(Ord. 91-114. Passed 5-6-91.)
 
   (g)    An open, uncovered porch, paved terrace, patio, or other similar

   (h)    In all zoning districts, where a driveway is placed near a property
line, in addition to the other requirements of this section there shall be a
minimum side yard of four feet between the property line and the nearest edge
of the driveway.
(Ord. 95-111. Passed 4-3-95.)
1155.04 REAR YARDS.
   (a)    Where a lot abuts upon any street, service street, or alley, the rear
yard shall be measured from the right-of-way line of the existing street,
service street, or alley.
(Ord. 85-107. Passed 3-4-85.)
 
   (b)    An accessory building, not exceeding fifteen (15) feet in height, may
occupy not more than thirty (30) percent of the area of a required rear yard
and unenclosed parking spaces may occupy not more than sixty (60) percent of
the area of a required rear yard. No accessory building shall be closer than
ten (10) feet to an existing main building be erected or located closer than
four (4) feet to any rear lot line.
(Ord. 96-158. Passed 11-21-96.)
 
   (c)    Cornices, canopies, eaves, pilasters, sills, or other architectural
features may project into any rear yard a distance not exceeding three (3)

balconies opening upon fire towers and the ordinary projections of chimneys and
flues into a rear yard may project into any rear yard for a distance not to
exceed five (5) feet when these are so placed as not to obstruct light and
ventilation.
 
   (e)    A wall or fence not over four (4) feet high may be erected in any
rear yard. If the wall is a retaining wall, the height shall be measured on the
highest (fill) side. (No fence, trees, or foliage shall be maintained so as to
obstruct the view of a driver of a vehicle as provided in Section
1155.08.)
(Ord. 86-134. Passed 3-2-87.)
 
   (f)    An open uncovered porch, paved terrace, patio, or other similar
outdoor living area which is an integral part of the dwelling may project into
the required rear yard provided rear yard is not reduced to less than 20 feet
as a result of the projection.
(Ord. 99-123. Passed 8-5-99.)
1155.05 HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   The regulation of maximum structure height prescribed in the schedule
accompanying Section
1155.01 shall also apply to church spires, belfries, monuments, tanks, water
and fire towers, stage towers or scenery loft, cooling towers, ornamental
towers and spires, chimneys, silos, elevator bulkheads, smokestacks, conveyors,
flagpoles and similar structures. Heights beyond the permitted maximums will be

lot area and width requirements of the district; provided said lot has a
minimum of forty (40) feet frontage on a public street.
1155.07 SETBACK FROM PUBLICLY ESTABLISHED DRAINAGE DITCHES.
   In all districts, a set back of forty (40) feet from the centerline of a
publicly established open drainage ditch shall be provided for all buildings or
structures erected along such ditch.
1155.08 FENCES AND HEDGES.
   (a)   Fences may be constructed and located as hereinafter described,
subject to obtaining a Zoning Permit for same, and shall be maintained in good
condition at all times.
      (1)   Each applicant for such Zoning Permit shall file an application for
a Zoning Permit and it shall be accompanied by a detail drawing or drawings and
other such descriptive matter as shall clearly state where the fence shall be
constructed or erected and what type of fence will be constructed or erected.
   (b)   General Regulations.
      (1)   Fences or hedges at intersections shall in no case exceed in
elevation a plane determined by two intersecting lines three feet above the
centerline of the roadway and extending twenty feet along the intersecting
right-of- way lines from their intersection.
      (2)   Fences, walls or hedges permitted by this section may be located on
the property line between abutting properties, if the abutting property owners
agree on its location. If such fence, wall or hedge is needed by one owner, but
the abutting property owner disagrees with its location, it may be constructed,
but shall be located at least three feet within the property line in order that
it may be maintained in good condition at all times. The space between such
wall, fence or hedge and the lot line of the adjoining premises shall be
landscaped with grass, hardy shrubs or evergreen ground cover and maintained in
good condition.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall conflict or alter special
requirements for uses such as swimming pools where special provisions are
established for fences.
      (4)   Chain link fences shall not be permitted within a front setback in
any zoning district.
      (5)   Fences shall be maintained in good condition without any
advertising thereon, and shall be constructed so as not to obstruct visibility
or cause an unsafe condition for motor vehicles, cyclists or pedestrians along
any adjacent road right(s)-of-way.
      (6)   No fencing or hedge shall be placed in the road right of way.
      (7)   On all side, front or rear yard fences of the supporting rails and
posts, the rough and unfinished sides of the fence shall face the interior of
the property of the owner(s) of the fence.
   (c)   Residential Regulations.
      (1)   Fences and hedges in front setbacks shall not exceed four (4) feet
in height.
      (2)   Fences and hedges in side and rear setbacks not abutting streets
shall not exceed six (6) feet in height. When the side or rear setback abuts a
street the fence or hedge shall not exceed four (4) feet in height.

   In computing the number of spaces required in Section
1157.04, the following rules shall govern:
   (a)    "Floor area" means the gross floor area of the specified use.
   (b)    Where fractiona1 spaces result, the parking spaces required shall be
construed to be the next highest number.
   (c)    In the case of a use not specifically mentioned above, the
requirements for off- street parking facilities for a use which is so mentioned
and to which said use is similar, as determined by Planning Commission, shall
apply.
   (d)    In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements for off-street
parking facilities shal1 be the sum of the requirements for the various uses,
computed separately. Off-street parking facilities for one use, shall not be
considered as providing required parking facilities for any other use.
   (e)   Whenever a building or use constructed or established after the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance (April 3, 1985) is changed or enlarged
in floor area, number of dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise, so as
to create a need for an increase in the number of required parking spaces, such
increase in parking spaces shall be computed on the basis of the enlargement or
change in compliance with the parking requirements set forth herein.
   (f)   Whenever a building or use which existed prior to the effective date
of this Zoning Ordinance (April 3, 1985) is changed or enlarged in floor area,
number of dwelling units, seating capacity or otherwise, so as to create a need
for an increase in the number of required parking spaces, such increase in
parking spaces shall be computed on the basis of the enlargement or change in
compliance with the parking requirements set forth herein.
1157.06 LOCATION OF REQUIRED LOADING AND PARKING SPACES.
     (a)   The off-street loading and parking spaces required by this Section
may be located in any yard in commercial or industrial districts, but shall not

loading spaces are developed in the front yard of any lot in a commercial,
industrial or industrial office district, the provisions of Section
1157.07 and
1155.02 shall be met.

which adjoins or faces premises situated in any R District or institutional
premises, by a masonry wall or solid fence. Such wall or fence shall be not
less than four feet or more than six feet in height and shall be maintained in

a strip of land not less than fifteen feet in width and landscaped with grass
or evergreen ground cover and planted and maintained with an evergreen hedge or
dense planting of evergreen shrubs not less than four feet nor more than six
feet in height may be substituted. No wall, fence or hedge as required by this
Section shall be located in a required front yard closer to the street line
than the building or setback line required in the district in which it is
located. Where parking areas are developed in the front yard, even though the
property is located in a commercial or industrial district and the abutting or
opposite properties are also the same district, a fifteen foot strip of land,

properties. The parking area shall be so arranged and marked so as to provide
for orderly and safe parking and storage of self-propelled vehicles. The
surface for all off-street parking areas, loading and access driveways shall be
asphalt or concrete.

1157.10 JOINT PROVISION OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent the collective
provision of off- street parking facilities for two or more buildings or uses
of similar character, provided the total of such collective off-street parking
facilities shall not be less than the sum of the requirements of this Section.
A written agreement between the parties shall be filed with the application for
a zoning certificate, stating that the proposed joint parking area will be
developed and maintained jointly and by mutual agreement. The location of such
joint parking shall conform to the location requirements of this Section.

   (a)   The Planning Commission shall have the authoirty to reduce the number
of parking spaces required by the Codified Ordinances where the applicant
demonstrates that the number of parking spaces required by Chapter
1157 is substantially in excess of the parking reasonably needed to serve the
employees, patrons and other persons frequenting the subject property. The
Planning Commission shall determine, in its discretion, the number of parking
spaces which the applicant must construct based upon such evidence. In the
event the Planning Commission determines that the applicant is not presently
required to construct all of the parking spaces required by Chapter
1157, the Planning Commission shall require the applicant to “Land Bank” a
portion of the applicant’s property for future such parking, as provided by
this section.
   (b)   Sufficient usable space shall be reserved upon the subject property
for the future construction of the required parking spaces not presently being
constructed. The reservation of said space and the purpose therefor shall be
shown upon the approved site plan. Any future applications concerning said
property shall show all such “Land Bank” area.
   (c)   As part of such approval, the applicant shall revise the property deed
and re- record the deed to include a deed restriction setting forth the area to
be reserved for future parking space construction and a clear statement of the
purpose thereof, and binding any future owners, transferees and their assigns
to said restrictions. Said deed restrictions shall include such other
conditions as may be required by the Planning Commission, and the language of
said deed restrictions shall be approved by the Village Solicitor. No zoning
permit based upon the Site Plan shall be issued until the applicant has
submitted to the Chairman of the Planning Commission a certified copy of the
recorded deed with said restrictions.

will remain in effect or the use-life of the pipeline. If any gas/oil lines
interfere with other public utilities servicing Village rights of way, these
gas/oil lines shall be relocated at the owner's expense.
(Ord. 84-127. Passed 2-4-85; Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)
1161.06 LOCATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND CRITERIA.
    As a basis for assuring that gas and oil wells and any associated equipment
will be of minimum hazard to and compatible with, surrounding development, the
location, evaluation and approval of a proposed well site and associated
production and processing equipment site shall be based upon the following
criteria:
   (a)    Preference will be given to sites proposed in existing industrially
zoned areas.
   (b)    Proposed sites will be considered from the perspective of both
existing and future development and should not be located so as to be
potentially detrimental to the future use and development of the parcel(s) upon
which the well is to be located or of any adjoining parcels.
    (c)    No gas well shall be located within 100 feet of an electrical power
line or transmission line of any public or private utility.
    (d)    All future residential buildings to be constructed in the vicinity
of a well or production and processing equipment shall be located at least 200
feet from any existing wells or associated equipment (excluding transmission
lines); proposed residential subdivisions and multi-family developments shall
be designed so that all future residential dwellings shall be located at least
200 feet from any existing wells or production and processing equipment
(excluding transmission lines).
   (e)    No drilling for oil and/or gas wells and no associated production or
processing equipment (including transmission lines) shall be permitted within
500 feet of any existing school, church, hospital, theater or assembly hall, as
these terms are defined by the Ohio Revised Code or this code, regardless of
the zoning district, except as otherwise provided herein,
   (f)    Sites proposed in non-industrial zoning districts may be considered
and may be approved if the proposed well location and associated production and
processing site are determined to be in compliance with the following
requirements:
      (1)    Sites are selected which will utilize and/or maximize the
potential screening and shielding effects of existing topographic, vegetative,
and man-made conditions for existing or proposed residential development;
      (2)    Sites are not located inside of, or closer than, 500 feet to the
property lines of an existing major residential subdivision or neighborhood of
20 or more platted or unplatted lots upon which more than 50% of the existing
lots have residential dwellings;
      (3)    Sites are not located inside of, or closer than, 500 feet to the
boundaries of an existing multi-family development approved for 20 or more
dwellings of which more than 50% are constructed;
      (4)    Sites are not located in areas which will necessitate the use of
minor residential streets for well drilling, production and service vehicles,
and equipment access during the drilling, fracturing, and production of the
well; and
       (5)    Sites are not located in areas of unique, unusual, or significant
natural characteristics which could be permanently or irreparably damaged or
which could have their recreational, open space, natural area use, or aesthetic
value significantly reduced.
   (g)    No site which is to be utilized for the processing of sour gas shall
be located within 1000 feet of an existing residence.
   (h)    In the case of particular proposals for well locations or sites for
the associated production and processing equipment, where strict compliance
with the foregoing criteria and requirements may be a handicap or an excessive
burden to the use of the property and where no undue hazard will be created,
requirements and degrees of compliance may be reduced or modified after proper
review by the Planning Commission.
   (i)    The Planning Commission shall have the right to consider any and all
special features or conditions they may consider important in determining
whether or not an undue hazard is created and may require such other additional
conditions they may find necessary, for the achievement of the objective of
this section or other sections of this code.

and shall state the ultimate location of waste disposal.
   (c)    Performance Guarantee. 
      (1)    At the time of approval, $5,000 cash shall be deposited with the
Village Fiscal Officer for deposit into a separate interest bearing account to
serve as a financial guarantee for the compliance with the requirements of this
section and other applicable sections of the Village's regulations. Such a
guarantee shall not only be conditioned upon compliance by the applicant, but
also upon compliance with these requirements by any assignee and owner of any
drilling conditional zoning certificate granted under these regulations, or by
any employee, contractor, subcontractor or other party performing services in
connection with any certificate. Guarantees shall be released only upon
completion of all restoration, landscaping, and termination of operation as
provided for on the plans approved by the Planning Commission. Completion shall
be determined by the Planning Commission after inspection of the facilities and
site by the Zoning Inspector and Village Engineer.
      (2)    This guarantee may be utilized in full or in part by the Village
for maintenance deemed necessary by the Zoning Inspector or Village Engineer,
or his designate, and not being done by the permit holder after written notice
by the Village to the permit holder indicating the nature of the problem and
the time period to be allowed for the remedy. The guarantee shall be maintained
at the level of $5,000 and shall be replenished to that level each time a
Village incurred cost is charged against it. Failure to maintain the cash
guarantee at a level of $5,000 shall be grounds for certificate revocation
pursuant to Section
1161.08(c). All such Village costs shall be documented, a permanent record
maintained, and a copy sent to the permit holder. In the event the $5,000
guarantee account should accrue $1,000 interest, the Village Fiscal Officer
shall release said interest in excess of the $5,000 guarantee.
       (3)    Technical Assistance. In light of the technical and potentially
complex nature of well drilling, gas and oil production and facilities
maintenance, the Village may need to utilize the Village Solicitor, Village
Engineer, other consultants, technical people, and special equipment for the
evaluation and regulation of plans, operations and maintenance including such
things as monitoring and measuring noise and odor levels. The costs for such
consultants, technical people or special equipment shall be paid for by the
applicant or permit holder in an amount not to exceed the amount of the
performance guarantee and may be charged against the performance guarantee. In
the event additional money is required, these costs will be incurred only upon
the prior consideration and approval by the Planning Commission in consultation
with the well owner, applicant, or permit holder.
    (d)    Easement or Options.  Copies of easements or options for easements
shall be submitted with the application for all pipelines, production and
processing equipment and access drives where all such facilities are to cross
properties not included as part of the drill site or drill unit.
   (e)    Emergency Information. In order that some responsible person or
persons may be reached at any time in the event of an emergency, the name,
address and telephone numbers of the persons responsible for the ownership,
operation, and all maintenance of each drilled well, whether capped,
temporarily out of production, not yet fractured, or in production, located
within the Village shall be furnished to the service director, police
department and fire department. This information shall include the street
location and state permit number and name of the well. The fire chief shall
prepare a list of such names, addresses and well information and shall keep the
list posted in a conspicuous place in the police and fire departments for ready
reference.
   (f)    State Permit Required. Applications for a well drilling conditional
zoning certificate shall be considered by the Planning Commission only when the
application includes a copy of both a currently valid permit issued by the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources, Division of Oil and Gas, and the applicant's
completed permit application from the Division which shall include all
information required thereon, and evidence of compliance with all conditions
for permit approval.
   (g)    Waivers from Residents Within 200 Feet. No drilling shall be
permitted for oil or gas wells within 200 feet of any existing building or
structure of any nature unless written waivers as herein specified accompany an
application for a well drilling conditional zoning certificate:
      (1)   The owners and adult occupants of any building or structure which
is located within 200 feet of the proposed well, as located on the well
location survey, must waive, in writing, the minimum distance requirements set
forth in these regulations. The owners or occupants may waive down to a minimum
distance of 100 feet without the necessity of vacating or causing to be
vacated, any buildings or structures during drilling operations.
      (2)    The owners and adult occupants of any building or structure of any
nature may consent to drilling for oil and gas closer than 100 feet to such
buildings or structures, but in such cases, the Planning Commission shall
consider special features affecting the application for a drilling certificate,
such as topographical conditions, nature of occupancy, and proximity of
buildings on the abutting property, facilities available at the fire department
to cope with controlling liquid and gas fires, and such other matters as the
Planning Commission shall deem relevant to the application. Should the Planning
Commission, upon considering such special features, find that an undue hazard
is created, the irrespective of waivers being provided, as specified in this
section, the Planning Commission shall refuse to authorize a conditional zoning
certificate to drill. Such denial and the undue hazard upon which the denial is
based, shall be recorded in the minutes of the Planning Commission.
      (3)    Where the owners and adult occupants of any building or structure
which is closer than 200 feet to a proposed well have waived in writing, at any
time, the distance requirement provided in this section for any proposed gas or
oil drilling site, then such property owners and occupants shall be deemed to
have waived the distance requirement provided for in this section down to the
same distance that such party waived for the other proposed drilling site or to
the distance that a gas or oil well was actually drilled, whichever is smaller.
      (4)    All distances, as set forth in this section, shall be those
distances as measured from the proposed well location as shown on the state
required well location survey.
   (h)    Affidavit of Compliance or Exceptions. The applicant for a well
drilling conditional zoning certificate shall be required to file with the
application, an affidavit stating that the applicant has complied with all
conditions of this subchapter and other applicable requirements of this code,
or setting forth any exceptions thereto. Any false or erroneous statement in
the affidavit shall be grounds to refuse to authorize a conditional zoning
certificate to drill or shall be grounds to revoke a certificate already
authorized or issued by the Village.
(Ord. 84-127. Passed 2-4-85; Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)
1161.08    PROCEDURE AND GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All applicants for a gas or oil well drilling conditional zoning certificate
shall comply with the following procedures and requirements:
   (a)    Public Hearing and Notice. After receipt of an application for a
conditional zoning certificate under this section, the Planning Commission
shall schedule and hold a public hearing. The Planning Commission shall fix the
time for the hearing and shall give notice thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Municipality at least ten (10) days before the date of said
hearing. The notice shall set forth the time and place of the public hearing
and the nature of the proposed conditional use. The applicant shall cause a
list of all parties of interest to be filed with the Planning Commission.
Parties of interest shall include all property owners whose properties abut the
drill unit and residents within the Village or neighboring municipalities,
including the chief executive officer of elected officials of neighboring
municipalities, within 1200 feet of the well head. The Planning Commission
shall mail at least ten (10) days before the day of the hearing, written notice
of such hearing by certified mail to all parties of interest. The public
meeting must occur not less than three weeks prior to the commencement of
drilling. In addition to all notices required by this section, the permit
holder or well driller shall cause a final notice to be sent by certified mail,
one week prior to the actual drilling, notifying the forementioned residents,
property owners and elected officials of the day drilling operations will
commence. Compliance with the hearing provisions of this subchapter shall be
mandatory conditions precedent to the commencement of drilling under the
permit.
   (b)    Certificate Issuance; Liability Insurance. Upon approval by the
Planning Commission, and after compliance with the prerequisites to issuance
contained herein, the Zoning Inspector shall issue a gas or oil well drilling
conditional zoning certificate which shall include all conditions and terms
specified by the Planning Commission.
      (1)    Prior to issuance of the well drilling conditional zoning
certificate, the Village shall be provided with a policy or certificate of
insurance covering the applicant's liability for property damage in an amount
of not less than $500,000 and for personal injury in an amount not less than
$1,000,000 which insurance policy or policies must be maintained for such
period of time as drilling is in progress, the well is in operation or is
producing oil or gas, or until such well is pulled and plugged as hereinafter
provided. The insurance policies and the coverages thereunder must be
completely satisfactory to the Village and such policies may be rejected by the
Village for any valid reason. Such rejection of the insurance policies by the
Village shall serve to stay the issuance of a permit theretofore approved by it
until such time as an insurance policy providing coverage entirely satisfactory
to the Village has been provided by the applicant.
      (2)    All applicants shall be required to prove that insurance policies
required by this section provide coverage for all the items set forth in this
section, including conditions where there is a blowout in the drilling of an
oil or gas well and other conditions creating a need for liability coverage.
      (3)    The permit holder shall pay to the owners of any realty, crops,
buildings, improvements, goods or chattels located in the area, any extra cost
of insurance on the property imposed by reason of the granting of the permit or
the operations carried on thereunder, and any and all damages suffered by any
person, persons, or corporation as to property within the Village or adjacent
communities from fire over and above the insurance collected thereon, or from
oil, gas, or water caused by or originating from the operation connected with
the well, and will hold the Village free and harmless from any and all
liability growing out of the granting of the well drilling certificate.
   (c)    Inspections; Certificate Revocation.  The Zoning Inspector or Village
Engineer shall have the authority, at any time to enter upon property where a
well is in the process of being drilled, or upon a producing well site, for the
purpose of inspecting the site, equipment and-all other things necessary to
assure compliance with the objectives and requirements of this subchapter.
Failure to comply with any provisions of this subchapter shall be grounds to
refuse to issue a permit to drill or shall be grounds to revoke a permit
already issued by the Village. Upon a recommendation from the Zoning Inspector
or Village Engineer that grounds for revocation exist, the Planning Commission
may find and determine that good cause exists to revoke the permit and it may
revoke said permit. Revocation of a permit shall remove all rights of the
permit holder to drill for oil or gas, to fracture the well, or to continue
production until such time as the permit holder takes steps to come into
compliance with this section. Operation after revocation of the permit shall
constitute a violation of this section and shall be a misdemeanor punishable
under the appropriate provisions of the Village ordinances.
      (A.O.; Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)
1161.09  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
   All applicants and permit holders shall comply with the following specific
requirements, which are deemed to be minimum specifications unless noted
otherwise:
   (a)    Limits on Unitizing Properties.  Any owner who has utilized or
unitized any portion of his property by entering into a community lease or
other agreement shall not share in any adjacent well production because of
conflicting lease interests of such real estate caused by such real estate
being in more than one unitized site. It is the express intention of this
provision to prohibit an owner of property from unitizing identical property
under more than one community lease or agreement.
   (b)    Drilling Equipment and Training of Crews.
      (1)   Rotary equipment. The drilling preparation used in wells drilled
with rotary equipment shall be capable of sealing off each oil, gas, brine, or
fresh water stratum above the producing horizon or objective formation and
shall be capable of preventing blowouts and flows of salt or fresh water, in
accordance with good well drilling practice. Rotary tools shall have the
innermost string of casing equipped with a blowout preventer properly installed
and tested prior to drilling into any formation likely to contain oil or gas.
        (2)    Cable tools. Wells drilled with cable tools shall have the
innermost string of casing equipped with a high pressure master valve and
control head and an oil saver, securely anchored by concrete, prior to drilling
into any formation likely to contain oil or gas.
       (3)   Crews and equipment. All crews shall be trained in the operation
of the blowout preventer, control head and related equipment, and all equipment
to be used shall be in good condition. Sanitary toilet facilities shall be
provided on the drill site for the drilling crew.
    (c)    Protection of Fresh Water Wells. It shall be the duty of the permit
holder to seal gas and oil wells to protect fresh water wells from salt water
or other pollution or contamination in such proper manner as is in accordance
with good practice. Both the permit holder and well driller shall establish
contingency plans for the immediate furnishing of potable water to effected
residents for such period as may be required to re-establish proper potability
on any polluted or contaminated well or wells. Unless otherwise specified by
the conditional zoning certificate the requirement to provide such immediate
water supply shall be limited to residents within 1000 feet of the well head.
The permit holder and the driller shall be jointly and severally responsible
for the obligation to provide potable water, without cost to the residents
receiving the water. Should the Planning Commission deem it necessary because
of unusual geological or other circumstances, it may require the permit holder
or driller to test water of fresh water wells within 2000 feet of the well
site. Such test may be required at any time.
   (d)    Drainage Into Sewers, Water Courses and Surrounding Areas. No waste,
sludge, water or effluents of any type, where an oil or gas wel1 is being
drilled, fractured, or is in production, shall in any manner, be emptied or
drained into any storm or sanitary sewer, drainage course, water body, wetland,
or any other area. All sludge and holding pits shall be lined and diked so that
no waste, sludge, water or effluents are allowed to penetrate the soil or to
run off and pollute any area outside of the dike. Disposal of all those
materials shall be in strict compliance with the provisions of the approved
conditional zoning certificate and referenced plans and proposals.
   (e)    Drilling Pits. Drilling pits shall be sized so as to fully contain
all drilling fluids plus any fluids resulting from natural precipitation. An
earthen dike shall be constructed around the perimeter of the pit. A properly
sized, properly anchored, reinforced, single piece plastic liner
(specifications available from the Village Engineer) shall be placed within the
pit and care shall be taken to ensure the integrity of the liner. Should the
pit excavation be in coarse, sandy soil a soil sealant with specifications
satisfactory to the Village Engineer shall be applied to the entire surface of
the earthen pit prior to the installation of the plastic liner. The Village
Engineer shall be notified of and inspect each phase of the drilling pit
construction. The discharge line must be equipped with a baffle which deflects
the cuttings as they enter the drilling pit in order to preserve the integrity
of the pit liner throughout the drilling operation. Gas must be flared through
a flow line at least 60 feet long into a flare pit located a safe distance away
from the drilling pit and directed away from any inhabited structure. During
drilling, contents of the pit shall be hauled away as needed and as required by
State law. Upon completion of drilling, all liquid wastes shall be removed from
the pit. Within thirty (30) days, the remaining contents of the pit and the
plastic liner shall be removed and hauled away, the pit inspected by the
Village Engineer and backfilled. Extensions for weather delays may be granted
by the Village Engineer.
   (f)    Storage Tanks And Production Equipment. In non-industrially zoned
areas having two or more existing residences within 500 feet of the storage
tanks and production equipment site, all storage tanks and other equipment
shall not exceed a height of ten feet above the average grade outside the diked
and fenced area. In any zoning district, the location of tank batteries and
other production equipment shall meet the following locational and other
criteria:
       (1)    In areas in which two or more wells are proposed for adjacent
properties or drill units or are to be located within reasonable distances of
one another, the storage tanks and processing equipment shall be consolidated
on a single or as few sites as possible.
      (2)    Storage tanks and all other processing equipment shall be set back
from all road right-of-ways at least 100 feet.
      (3)    Storage tanks, production facilities, and processing equipment
shall have access drives of such quality, lengths, widths and locations to
assure year-round access for service and emergency equipment and to minimize
any potential conflict with traffic on existing and proposed roads.
   (g)    Diking of Storage Tanks. All gas and oil well storage tanks or groups
of tanks situated within the corporate limits of the Village shall be diked and
maintained to prevent discharge of liquid from endangering adjoining property
or reaching waterways. Each dike shall have a capacity of 150% of that of the
tank or tanks served by the enclosure and shall be completed prior to the
initiation of production and processing through the enclosed facilities. All
dikes shall be continuous with no openings for roadways and no residual opening
shall remain as a result of piping passing through except for an outlet valve
for use in release of accumulated rain water. All dikes shall be constructed of
earth, clay, steel, masonry, or reinforced concrete so constructed to be
watertight and afford adequate protections and, if of concrete or masonry,
shall be properly reinforced and shall have footings below the frostline.
   (h)    Access to the Well Site. The permit holder or well driller shall
install a 40-foot long, 3/8-inch minimum walled steel culvert, ten inches in
diameter or larger, as specified and approved by the Village Engineer, or his
designate, located in the roadside ditch or other location determined by the
Village Engineer, or his designate, at each entrance or exit to a proposed well
site. This installation is to provide for a ground cushion and entrance pad at
the road edge to prevent berm and roadway damage or destruction. Further, a
gravel entry drive of not less than 100 feet in length by ten feet in width,
and of a gravel type and thickness as specified by the Village Engineer, or his
designate, shall be laid out as a vehicle clean-up area to help reduce the
amount of mud being carried onto the road right-of-way and pavement. This
culvert and gravel entry drive shall be installed prior to the arrival of
drilling equipment at the site and shall be maintained in an acceptable manner.
   (i)    Maintenance of Site and Streets.  All permit holders and well
drillers shall use care in the set up, operation, and removal of drilling and
fracturing equipment to keep the area around the drilling site free of mud
which might otherwise be carried onto the public street by any vehicle or other
equipment used at the drilling site. Should any mud be carried onto public
streets from a drilling site, the permit holder shall be required to clean up
the streets to the satisfaction of the Village. The Village shall have
authority to request a permit holder or well driller to take specific steps to
reduce mud at a given location. Failure of a permit holder or well driller to
clean up the public streets to the satisfaction of the Village, or failure to
take specific steps to reduce mud at a given location, as requested by the
Village shall be grounds for revocation of a permit, forfeiture of the cash
performance guarantee posted, and shall further be a misdemeanor punishable
under the appropriate provisions of the Village ordinances. If deemed necessary
by the permit holder, driller, Zoning Inspector, or Village Engineer, suitable
washing equipment shall be stationed at the road entry location and used to
remove the loose mud from all vehicle tires and equipment prior to entry upon
the public road right-of-way.
   (j)   Noise Level. Drilling operations shall be controlled by double
exhausts, mufflers, or otherwise, so that the noise level of actual drilling
does not exceed the noise level of 85 decibels at a 300 foot radius during
maximum noise production periods or at such other level as complies with the
applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration Regulations, if any.
   (k)    Restoration of the Site and Public and Private Property.  The permit
holder or well driller shall clear the site and area of all litter, rubbish,
machinery, derricks, buildings, structures, oil or other substances used or
associated in the drilling, fracturing or producing operations. The permit
holder or well driller shall restore the streets, sidewalks, drainage
facilities and water courses and other Village, public facilities or places
which have been damaged or disturbed in the various operations. All restoration
and cleaning up of the site and area shall be completed within 90 days of the
date of the initiation or drilling and shall be done regardless of whether a
producing well has resulted or whether the well has been fractured. Restoration
shall include, at a minimum, the fine grading of the soil to produce a readily
mowable conditions and the establishment of a grass or other vegetative cover
sufficient to prevent erosion and rapid storm water runoff.
   (l)    Equipment, Operation, and Maintenance of Producing Wells. The permit
holder and well driller shall meet the following requirements for all producing
wells:
      (1)    All pipelines used for transmission of gas, oil, or other
hydrocarbons, shall be located at least 40 inches below the surface, shall be
well marked on the surface as to their location, and shall be located on
easements, which are located with due consideration for potential conflict with
existing future development, streets, excavations and other activity areas.
      (2)    Excluding initial drill stem well testing and other extraordinary
well production conditions, all removal of brines, oil, or other substances
from a well shall be accomplished by pumping or other closed system methods; no
gas or liquids of any kind shall be expelled directly to the air without first
removing all oil, salt, or other potential environmental contaminants,
including odor producing elements normally associated with sour gas.
      (3)    All well pumps shall be operated by electric motors only; all
power lines leading to a well site shall be located underground.
      (4)    All gas and oil production facilities shall be equipped with
automatic regulating and shut-off valves, which shall be located in the system
ahead of any pressure relief valves included in the producing and processing
equipment. Such valves shall be designed to eliminate or reduce to as great a
degree as possible, the venting of gas to the air.
      (5)    All gas and oil production and processing facilities serving wells
producing sour gas shall be designed to effectively prevent the release of
hydrogen sulfides or other mercaptens to the air.
      (6)    The fire chief, fire marshal, and Village Engineer, or their
designates, shall be notified 24 hours in advance of all scheduled or
anticipated well tests and other extraordinary well production conditions which
will result in large volumes of gas being released to the air.
      (7)    The well site, access drive, well head, production and processing
equipment, dikes, fences, and landscaping shall all be maintained in good
condition, during the full period of production from the well and until such
time as the well, whether a producing well or note, has been abandoned and
removed, and the site restored to a condition compatible and consistent with
the general conditions of the neighborhood and area.
   (m)    Fencing and Landscaping.  The permit holder and well driller of any
drilled well, whether producing or not, shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)    Within one year of the initiation of drilling or prior to the
initiation of production, whichever occurs earlier, the well head and all
production and processing equipment shall be enclosed by a permanent eight foot
high chain link fence with two (2) strands of barbed wire on top and such
quality and maintenance to prevent, to a reasonable degree, any unauthorized
entry or access.
      (2)    Wells, production facilities, and processing equipment located on
a site in a platted residential subdivision, in a proposed residential
subdivision, or in an area of existing homes where two or more dwellings, not
belonging to an owner of property in the drill unit or to the permit holder for
said well or equipment, are located partly or completely within a radius of 300
feet from the well or equipment shall be enclosed by a vision obscuring masonry
wall or wood fence at least eight feet high.
      (3)    In all undeveloped areas not part of a platted or proposed
residential subdivision or not containing existing homes as specified in (m)
(2) above, the vision obscuring masonry wall and wood fences may be delayed at
the discretion of the Planning Commission, who may at some future date require
vision obscuring fences in response to changing development conditions and as a
condition for the continued production of an existing well. Non-vision
obscuring fences shall be of chain link at least eight feet high.
       (4)    Wells, production facilities and processing equipment located on
a site adjacent to existing or proposed residential, commercial, or other non-
residential structures or land uses, or highways, where existing views or other
aesthetic conditions are potentially damaged by the well or facilities, may be
required by the Planning Commission, to be enclosed by a vision obscuring
masonry wall or wood fence at least eight feet high.
       (5)    In addition to fine grading and the restoration of grass or other

1163.01  INTENT.
   Within the districts established by this Ordinance or amendments hereinafter
adopted there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures which are
lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be
prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or
future amendments. It is the intent of this Ordinance to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival.
1163.02  WHEN PERMITTED.
   (a)   Any use of building or land existing at the effective date of this
Ordinance may be continued, even though such use does not conform to the
provisions herein, so long as such use was in conformity with the Municipal
Zoning Ordinance 384 established December 9, 1963, and as amended up to April
3, 1985. No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved, extended,
enlarged, reconstructed, or structurally altered, except as specifically
provided in this Ordinance.
   (b)    Any property purchased or acquired in good faith for any
nonconforming use prior to the adoption of this Ordinance, upon which property
the work of changing, remodeling or construction of such nonconforming use has
been legally commenced at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, may be used
for the nonconforming use for which such changing, remodeling, or construction
was undertaken provided that such work is completed within two (2) years of the
date of adoption of this Ordinance or amendment thereto making said use
nonconforming.
1163.03 SUBSTITUTION.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may allow the nonconforming use of a building or
structure to be changed to another nonconforming use of the same or of a more
restricted classification, provided it finds that the change will be no more
detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming use. Whenever a
nonconforming use has been changed to a more restrictive use or to a conforming
use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use.
1163.04 EXTENSION.
   No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed or
structurally altered, except as follows:
    (a)    The Planning Commission may permit a building containing a
nonconforming use to be enlarged to an extent not exceeding ten (10) percent of
the ground floor area of the existing building or buildings devoted to a
nonconforming use at the time of enactment of this Ordinance or at the time of
its amendment making a use nonconforming. The Planning Commission shall not
authorize any enlargement which would result in a violation of the provisions
of this Ordinance with respect to any adjoining premises, or which would occupy
ground space required for meeting the yard or other requirements of this
Ordinance. (Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)
    (b)    No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole or in
part to any other location unless such building or structure and the yard and
other open spaces provided are made to conform to all of the regulations of the
district in which such building or structure is to be located.
    (c)    Any residential structure which is nonconforming due to the fact of
its being in a GC or CE-District or in an I-District may be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed, or structurally altered provided it meets with the requirements
of the most restrictive R-District.
1163.05 DISCONTINUANCE.
   A nonconforming use which has been discontinued or abandoned shall not
thereafter be returned to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be
considered abandoned whenever any one of the following conditions exist.
   (a)    When the use has been discontinued voluntarily for a period of two
(2) years.
   (b)    When the nonconforming use has been replaced by a conforming use.
1163.06 DAMAGE AND/OR DESTRUCTION OF A NONCONFORMING BUILDING OR USE.
   When a building, the use of which does not conform to the provisions of this
Ordinance, is damaged by fire, explosion, Act of God, or by public enemy it may
be restored or rebuilt and continued in such nonconforming use, provided that
the restoration or rebuilding is commenced within six (6) months of the time of
damage and completed within 2-l/2 years.
 
1163.07 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance and
repair of a building or structure containing a nonconforming use. Structural
alterations may be made to a building or structure containing a nonconforming
use as follows:
   (a)    When required by law.
   (b)    To convert to a conforming use.
   (c)    A building or structure containing residential nonconforming uses may
be so altered as to improve interior livability. However, no structural
alterations shall be made which exceed the area or height regulations or which
would extend into any yard required in the district in which such building is
located.

   (b)    Determining Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be measured from
the average natural grade at the base of the sign or support structure to the
tallest element of the calculated sign area. A ground sign on a man-made base,
including a graded earth mound, shall be measured from the average site grade
prior to the addition of the sign.
   (c)    Determining Building Frontage and Building Unit. For the purposes of
these sign regulations, the length of the building wall that faces a public
street or that contains a public entrance to the uses therein shall be
considered the building frontage.
      (1)    The building frontage shall be measured along such building wall
between the exterior faces of the exterior side walls.
      (2)    In the case of an irregular wall surface, a single straight line
extended along such wall surface shall be used to measure the length.
      (3)    A building shall have only one building frontage except as
otherwise set forth below.
      (4)    A building shall have two frontages whenever the lot fronts on two
or more streets, or the building has a public entrance on a wall other than the
wall that faces the street. The property owner shall determine which wall shall
be primary building frontage and which wall shall be the secondary building
frontage. Only one outside wall of any business shall be considered its primary
frontage and only one additional wall considered its secondary frontage.
      (5)    For multi-occupant buildings, the portion of a building that is
owned or leased by a single occupant shall be considered a building unit. The
building frontage for a building unit shall be measured from the centerline of
the party walls defining the building unit.

window, door, fire escape, balcony, platform, stairway, ladder, vent or other
means of ingress of any building.
      (6)    No sign shall be attached to a utility pole, tree, trash
receptacle, bench or other structure not intended or approved as a sign
support.
      (7)    Temporary signs shall be durable and weather-resistant and
fastened or anchored sufficiently, whether attached to the building or
positioned in the ground.
      (8)    No sign regulated by any of the provisions of this Chapter shall
be erected in the right-of-way, in proximity to railroad crossings, or at the
intersection of any streets in such a manner as to obstruct free and clear
vision; or at any location where, by reason of the position, shape, or color,
it may interfere with, obstruct the view of, or be confused with, any
authorized traffic sign or device as defined in the Manual of Uniform Traffic
Control Devices; or which makes use of the words “STOP," "LOOK," "DANGER," or
any other word, phrase, symbol or character in such a manner as to interfere
with, mislead, or confuse traffic.
      (9)    No temporary sign shall have moveable lettering or lettering
capable of being moved or replaced.
   (c)    Maintenance. All signs shall be maintained in accordance with the
following:
      (1)    The property owner, occupant, or other person responsible for the
sign shall maintain the sign in a condition fit for the intended use and he or
she shall have a continuing obligation to comply with all building code
requirements and the requirements of this Chapter.
      (2)    If the Zoning Inspector finds that any sign is unsafe, insecure, a
menace to the public; or constructed, erected, or maintained in violation of
the provisions of this Code, notice shall be given in writing by the Zoning
Inspector to the property owner, occupant, or other person responsible for the
sign. The property owner, occupant, or other person responsible for the sign
shall, within forty-eight (48) hours of such notification, correct such unsafe
condition or remove the sign. If the correction has not been made within the
forty-eight (48) hours, the sign may be removed or altered by the Village to
comply with these regulations at the expense of the property owner, occupant,
or other person responsible for the sign. The Village Administrator may cause
any sign, which, in the Village Administrator's opinion, creates an immediate
danger to persons or property to be removed immediately and without prior
notice.
      (3)    Whenever any sign, either conforming or nonconforming to these
regulations, is required to be removed for the purpose of repair, refurbishing,
or repainting, the same may be done without a Zoning permit or any payment of
fees provided that all of the following conditions are met:
         A.    There shall be no alteration or remodeling to the sign base,
sign support(s) or the mounting of the sign itself.
         B.    There shall be no change in location or in any of the dimensions
of the sign or its structure.
         C.    The sign shall be an accessory to a legally permitted,
conditional or nonconforming use.
      (4)    The Zoning Inspector may order any sign to be painted or
refurbished whenever needed to keep the sign in a neat and safe condition. All
supports, guys, braces and anchors for such signs shall be maintained in a safe
condition, and it shall be unlawful for the owners or person having charge of

      (5)    Any permanent sign which advertises a business no longer conducted
on the premises or fails to serve the purposes for which it was intended, or
evidences a lack of maintenance, shall be removed by the owner, agent, or
person having the beneficial use of the building, structure or land upon which
such sign is located, within thirty (30) days after written notice by the
Zoning Inspector. A party served with such notice shall have the right to
appeal the Zoning Inspector's order by filing a notice or appeal with the
Zoning Board of Appeals within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice. Upon
failure to file a timely notice of appeal and failure to comply with such
notice within the time specified in such order, the Village Administrator is
hereby authorized to cause removal of such sign, and any expense incident
thereto shall be paid by the owner of the property on which the sign is
located.
      (6)    If a sign, its letters or its message are designed and approved by
a Village issued permit to be internally illuminated and the sign or any of its
letters or messages are only partially lit, all illumination of the sign shall
be discontinued until the sign is repaired and properly illuminated as it was
designed and approved in the permit for the sign.
         (Ord. 09-111. Passed 4-16-09.)
1165.09 REGULATIONS FOR NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (a)    Maintenance of Nonconforming Signs. Nonconforming signs shall be
maintained in good condition pursuant to this Chapter and may continue until
such sign is required to be removed as set forth in this Chapter.
   (b)    Alteration, Relocation or Replacement of Nonconforming Signs. A
nonconforming sign shall not be structurally altered, relocated or replaced
unless it is brought into compliance with the provisions of this Chapter,
except as otherwise permitted in this Chapter.
   (c)    Reconstruction of Damaged Sign. If a sign face and/or its support is
damaged to the extent where the repair costs exceed 50% of the replacement cost
of the sign, the sign shall be removed or brought into compliance with this
Chapter. If the repair costs do not exceed 50% of the replacement cost of the
sign, the sign may be repaired, subject to approval of consistency in design by
the Zoning Inspector and provided all repair work is completed within sixty
(60) days of the date the damage was incurred.
   (d)    Termination. A non-conforming sign shall immediately lose its legal
nonconforming status, and shall be brought into conformance with this Chapter
or removed, when any of the following occur:
      (1 )    The size or shape of the sign is changed.
      (2)    The sign structure is altered or moved.
      (3)    If the property upon which the sign is located ceases to be used
for a period of six (6) months or more.
   (e)    Historic Signs. The Planning Commission may grant exceptions to these
standards whenever a sign has been designated as a historic landmark pursuant
to applicable law.
(Ord. 09-111. Passed 4-16-09.)
1165.10 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   All permanent signs reviewed by the Zoning Inspector shall comply with the
following Standards.
   (a)    Diversity/Cohesiveness of Signs Seen in a Series. Within a commercial
area or development where multiple storefronts are situated side by side, the
level of variety of cohesiveness in the design of signs that are seen in a
series or sequence should be commensurate with the level of variety or
cohesiveness presented by the architecture of the building(s):
      (1)    Variety in the design of signs among different storefronts should
be encouraged when the architecture of the building(s) suggests variety.
      (2)    Storefronts with common architectural element should have signs
that share continuity of design so that the placement and design of individual
signs contribute to the cohesive appearance created by the common architectural
elements. For example, a series of storefronts that, because of their
architecture and design, have the appearance of a single building should have
occupant signs that share common elements. (See Figure 4.)

IMAGES/0-0-0-2899.gif]
      (3)    Sign Plans. Owners of multi-occupant building shall develop Sign
Plans in conformance with Section
1165.11(c)(4) for the building and site to aid in determining the level of
variety/cohesiveness required for signs.
   (b)    Placement of Signs on Buildings. Signs should be designed and placed
on buildings to be compatible with and complement the appearance of the
building.
      (1)    All signs should be reviewed for their impact on the overall
building facade.
      (2)    The sign and associated lighting fixtures should complement the
architecture of the building on which it is placed and should be placed in an
appropriate location on the building facade.
      (3)    If the building design does not clearly identify the appropriate
placement for a sign panel (see Figure 5), then individual letters are
encouraged unless there is a clear location for adding panels, such as
establishing one or more repetitive, common architectural features in order to
create a repetitive sequence. (See Figure 6.)

IMAGES/0-0-0-2901.gif]
      (4)    Whenever a new or renovated sign is proposed for an existing
building:
         A.    It may be determined that building alterations are needed in
order for the proposed sign to be properly placed on the building facade.
         B.    Any inappropriate and extraneous elements from past remodeling
project(s) should be removed prior to the design of the proposed sign and
restore the intended character of the building.
      (5)    A sign should be confined within the fascia consistent with signs
on adjacent buildings and shall not extend beyond the identified signable area
on the building or cover edges of the sign panel.
      (6)    In multi-occupant building, signs for the first floor occupants
should not extend above the windowsill of the second story unless the
establishment is also located on the second floor.
      (7)    Colors of the sign and the sign background should be compatible
with the building's colors.
   (c)    Specific Standards for Projecting Signs, and Ground Signs.
      (l)    Projecting Signs. The size of the lettering and graphics on a
projecting sign should be appropriate for viewing by pedestrians.
      (2)    Ground Signs. The design and placement of ground signs and
associated lighting fixtures should complement the overall visual appearance of
the site:
         A.   Ground signs should be designed to relate to and share common
design elements with the building and sign(s) attached to the building.
         B.    Whenever a building is located thirty (30) feet or more from the
street, its ground sign should be placed on a solid base.
         C.    Approved year-round landscaping shall be used around the base of
the sign to screen lighting fixtures and sources in compliance with Section
1165.08 (a)(1)(B). (See Figure 8.)

IMAGES/0-0-0-2903.gif]
         D.    When properly screened, the lower two (2) feet of the solid base
of a ground sign may be exempt from the sign area calculation. (See Figure 8.)
         E.    Ground signs should be spaced or combined along the street
frontage in a manner that ensures that one ground sign does not obscure the
view of another ground sign.
         F.    A ground sign that provides a directory of occupants for a
multi- occupant building should have simplicity of design to compensate for the
additional amount of information provided (i.e. utilize common elements such as
the same background color, or other common elements, etc.)
   (d)    Overall Design of Signs (Wall, Awning, Window, Projecting and Ground
Signs).
      (1)    The size and shape of the sign shall be in proportion to the space
the sign is to occupy:
         A.    A sign (whether comprised of a panel or individual letters)
should not exceed approximately 70% of the height and length of the signable
area of the building. (See Figures 9,10 and 11.)

IMAGES/0-0-0-2907.gif]
Figure 10. Height and width of sign panel should not exceed 70% of the height
and width of signable area. Height and width of lettering should not exceed 70%
of the height and width of sign panel.
Figure 11. Height and width of sign comprised of individual letters should not
exceed 70% of the height and width of signable area.
         B.    The lettering within a sign panel should not exceed
approximately 70% of the height and length of the sign panel. (See Figure 10.)
      (2)    Elements of the sign should create an overall cohesive design,
reflect simplicity, avoid visual clutter and ensure legibility. Each sign
should:
         A.    Be consolidated into a minimum number of elements, whether
words, symbols, or graphics.
         B.    Have a simple shape,
         C.    Have appropriate contrast,
         D.    Be designed with a limited number of, and harmonious use of,
colors,
         E.    Be constructed with a minimum number of materials.
      (3)    The message should be easy to read from the intended vantage
point- public street, public sidewalk, or public parking lot - but not be out
of scale with the building, site or streetscape.
         A.    The ratio of the message to the background should permit easy
recognition of the message.
         B.    Lettering size should be the size needed to ensure the sign can
be seen from the intended distance.
         C.    The number of items of information displayed should be
consistent with the amount of information that can be comprehended by the
intended viewer.
            1.    Generally ten (10) items or less of information per sign are
a typical amount of information the average person can comprehend while
driving. This is based upon the principle that the more readable the type face
and the better the contrast between the letter and the background, the more
readable and comprehendible the sign.
            2.    An item of information includes a symbol, geometric shape,
logo, word, abbreviation or number, or a grouping of letters and numbers which
together convey meaning. For signs combining different shapes, each shape may
be considered an item of information. (See Figure 12.)

IMAGES/0-0-0-2909.gif]
         D.    Lettering and numbers less than three (3) inches in height
should only be used when intended to be viewed from a vantage point on the
interior of the site, such as after the vehicle has entered the site or by
pedestrians.
         E.    For awning signs, the sign graphics should be located on the
portion of the awning fabric that hangs perpendicular to the horizontal plane
of the ground, below the awning's support structures.
      (4)    All plaques hanging from the same projecting sign supports should
have a compatible size, shape and color so that the entire projecting sign has
an overall cohesive design.
      (5)    All wall signs, projecting signs, ground signs and wall signs
mounted on a panel should have a compatible frame or border.
      (6)    The aggregate exterior lighting used to illuminate any one face in
a residential district should not exceed an initial lumen output of 2850 lumens
(equivalent to a 150 watt incandescent A lamp).
   (e)    Sign Construction. All signs shall be framed, constructed, and
erected so as to complement the overall appearance of the building and site as
well as the overall appearance of the sign.
      (1)    Sign Graphics. A sign's graphic elements shall be executed in a
professional manner.
      (2)    General Sign Construction.
         A.    All signs shall be constructed, and erected in a professional
and workmanlike manner.
         B.    Signs shall be structurally sound and located so as to pose no
threat to pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
      (3)    Materials.
         A.    Signs should be fabricated on and of materials that are of
permanent quality, good durability and are complimentary to the building of
which they become a part.
         B.    Materials used should be those materials that weather well and
reduce maintenance.
         C.    Signs should have a matte finish, not have a glossy or
reflective finish.
      (4)    Framing And Supports.
         A.    Visible frames or supports for freestanding or projecting signs
should be:
            1.    In scale with the size and character of the building;
            2.    Designed either as a key element of the sign or minimized so
as not to detract from the sign.
         B.    All signs attached to buildings shall be attached in a manner
that preserves the historic integrity of the building.
         C.    No part of any sign shall be revolving, oscillating or otherwise
designed to move to attract attention.
            (Ord. 09-111. Passed 4-16-09.)
1165.11  ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Compliance with this Chapter. No person shall erect, locate, move,
alter, or replace any sign or cause a sign to be located or maintained, unless
all provisions of this Chapter have been met.
   (b)    Signs Requiring a Zoning Permit. To ensure compliance with these
regulations, a Zoning permit shall be obtained for all signs including
temporary ground signs and banner signs, unless specifically exempted below,
and except ideological signs.
   (c)    Application Requirements.
      (1)    An application for a Zoning permit shall be made to the Village of
Middlefield on the form provided and in the manner required.
      (2)    When any person other than the owner of the property submits an
application, the owner of the property or an authorized agent for the owner
shall also sign such application.
      (3)    Each application shall be accompanied by drawings to scale,
showing:
         A.    The width of the building face which abuts the frontage street
and, for a building located on a corner lot, the building depth facing the
secondary street.
         B.    The design and layout proposed including the total area of the
sign, the size, character and color of letters, lines and symbols.
         C.    The method of illumination, if any.
         D.    The exact location of the sign in relation to the building and
property.
         E.    Details and specifications for construction, erection and
attachment as may be required.
      (4)    Applicants shall, when required pursuant to this Section, submit a
Sign Plan for review and approval by the Planning Commission.
         A.    A Sign Plan shall be required for all multi-occupant buildings
and shall be submitted by the owner of a multi-occupant building whenever:
            1.    A new multi-occupant building is constructed; or
            2.    An existing building is renovated, or remodeled and after the
renovation or remodeling, there is more than one occupant that occupies the
remodeled or renovated building; or    
            3.    When a replacement sign is proposed for an existing multi-
occupant building.
         B.    The Sign Plan shall create a set of specific standards for sign
design and placement on the proposed building, and on the site.
         C.    The Sign Plan shall include the following:

         E.    The complexity of the Sign Plan shall be based on the level of
variety/cohesiveness of the building architecture and the surrounding area.
When a building exhibits a high degree of architectural uniformity, the Sign
Plan should require a high degree of consistency among sign elements and
therefore, should specify standards for most or all of the elements set forth
in subsection (D) above.
   (d)    Sign Review.
      (1)    The Zoning Inspector shall review and act on applications for

1167.01 DEFINITION.
   “Satellite dish antennas” means any device incorporating a reflective
surface that is solid, open-mesh or bar configured, is in the shape of a
shallow dish, cone, horn, cornucopia or flat plate, and is used to transmit
and/or receive radio or electromagnetic waves or other signals between
terrestrially and/or orbitally based units. This definition is meant to include
but not be limited to what is commonly referred to as satellite earth stations,
satellite receivers, satellite dishes, direct broadcast systems (DBSs),
television reception only systems (TVROs) and satellite microwave antennae.
“Satellite dish antennas” shall not include any device for personal reception
of digital satellite service, which is 18 inches or less in diameter, provided
that such device is installed on the side or roof of the building which it
services.
(Ord. 96-132. Passed 8-1-96.)
1167.02 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person, firm or corporation shall erect a satellite dish antenna in the
Village without a conditional zoning permit, and no installation or erection
shall commence before a conditional zoning permit is issued in accordance with
Section
1167.03.
(Ord. 91-103. Passed 3-4-91.)
1167.03 APPLICATION FOR PERMIT; PLANS.
   (a)   Any person, firm or corporation who intends to construct or erect a
satellite dish antenna shall apply for a hearing before the Zoning Board of
Appeals for a conditional zoning permit referred to in Section
1167.02. An applicant who is not the owner of a lot, premises or parcel of land
on which such construction or erected satellite dish antenna is proposed shall
submit with his application the written consent of the owner to the placement
of the satellite dish antenna.
   (b)    The applicant shall submit the conditional zoning permit application
upon forms provided by the Fiscal Officer’s office along with a site plan of
the lot, premises or parcel of land, showing the exact location of the proposed
satellite dish antenna and the locations of all buildings on the subject lot; a
description of the kind of satellite dish antenna proposed; three complete sets
of construction plans, specifications and elevations of the proposed location
with sufficient details to show the method of assembly and construction; and,
the manufacturer's installation requirements and product specifications. Each
set of plans and specifications shall show the complete name and address of the
subject property owner and the complete name and address of the person who
prepared the plans and specifications. The application shall indicate the owner
or owners of the subject property, the occupant of the subject premises and the
contractor or other person who will be permitted to construct or erect the
proposed satellite dish antenna and who shall be a licensed contractor pursuant
to the regulations of the County of Geauga.
   All construction plans shall be certified with a professional mechanical or
civil engineer's stamp licensed in Ohio. However, a resident who proposes to
construct the satellite dish antenna by himself on property within a
residential district and for his own non- commercial use shall not be required
to have his construction plans certified by a professional engineer and shall
not be required to employ a licensed contractor for such construction. This
exemption shall in no way apply to any other provision of this chapter.
 
   (c)    Such application shall be submitted to the Fiscal Officer’s office
and be subject to the provisions set in Chapter
1135. In all cases the Board shall consider the applicant's right to reasonable
satellite signal reception when the Board determines whether to approve an
application pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 91-103. Passed 3-4-91.)
1167.04 LOCATION OF SATELLITE DISH ANTENNA.
   (a)    Residential Districts.
      (1)    No satellite dish antenna used for transmission purposes shall be
allowed and no more than one receive-only antenna shall be located on each lot.
      (2)    Satellite dish antennas in residential districts shall comply with
the setback requirements for accessory structures in such districts, as set
forth in Chapter
1155. This requirement may be varied upon a finding that reasonable signal
reception cannot be received from an otherwise permitted location and the
burden on any adjoining property owner is insubstantial.
      (3)    The satellite dish antenna shall not be installed in the area
between the lot's front property line and the residential structure located
thereon or in any side yard.
      (4)    The satellite dish antenna shall be ground-mounted or located
within a permitted structure.
      (5)    The satellite dish antenna shall only be linked to receivers
located on the same lot or premises as the antennae.
   (b)    Nonresidential Districts.
      (1)    The satellite dish antenna shall comply with the principal use
setback requirements for the district in which it is located if the satellite
dish antenna constitutes the principal use of the property or the satellite
dish antenna is located on property which adjoins a residential district or
lot. In all other circumstances, the antenna shall be at least ten feet from
the property line.
       (2)    The satellite dish antenna shall not be installed in the area
between the lot's front property line and the primary structure located
thereon.
       (3)    The satellite dish antenna shall be ground-mounted, located
within a permitted structure or on a flat roof.
       (4)    A satellite dish antenna shall only be linked to receivers or
transmitters located on the same lot or premises as the antenna. Separate lots
under common ownership or use shall be deemed to be the same premises for
purposes of this section.

1171.01 INTENT.
   In repealing the previous requirements of this Chapter, originally adopted
in Ordinance 02-120, the Village intends to shift primary responsibility for
enforcement of Water Management and Sediment Control in the Village from the
Village to the Geauga Soil and Water Conservation District ("GSWCD"). The
Village, however, reserves the right, in its discretion to enforce provisions
of the GSWCD Regulations (1) when GSWCD's efforts to obtain compliance have
failed, thereby necessitating enforcement action and (2) when the Village deems
it necessary and appropriate to do so.
   (a)   The primary monitoring and enforcement of these standards shall be
through the GSWCD. Enforcement actions, if necessary, shall be through the
Village Zoning Inspector and Solicitor.
   (b)   The Village shall have the right, but not the obligation, to perform
monitoring and enforcement of the standards adopted by the GSWCD, and shall
exercise such authority only in its discretion and only when it determines
necessary and appropriate.
   (c)   The intent of this Chapter is to authorize the GSWCD to enforce in the
Village the most recently adopted Geauga County Water Management and Sediment
Control Regulations (the "GSWCD Regulations") adopted by the Geauga County
Board of County Commissioners and administered by GSWCD. This Chapter shall
also authorize the Village Zoning Inspector and the Village Solicitor, when
necessary, to take enforcement actions in the event a property owner fails and
refuses to comply with a final directive from GSWCD.

(Ord. 20-119. Passed 8-13-20.)
1171.23 RAIN GARDENS
   (a)    Rain Gardens are permitted in residential zoning districts upon
issuance of a permit by the Village Zoning Inspector. For purposes of this
section, the term "Rain Garden" shall mean a landscaped feature or depression
which principally uses hardy, primarily native, plants and vegetation,
including wildflowers and prairie grasses, which require little or no
artificial planting or care, that treats on-site stormwater discharge from
impervious surfaces by collecting and filtering the stormwater, including, but
not limited to, so-called "Butterfly Gardens" and other similar landscaping
features.
   (b)    A permit may be issued for a Rain Garden if the following conditions
are met.
      (1)    Any Rain Garden must be located in a backyard and must be located
behind the footprint of the main residential building on the property. No Rain
Garden may be located in a front yard or side yard.
      (2)    A Rain Garden must be setback from any building by not less than
ten (10) feet.
      (3)    A Rain Garden must be a part of the subject property's stormwater
management system. A Rain Garden should be located to intercept water from
paved or impervious surfaces or from a downspout before such water leaves the
yard. A Rain Garden should not be located upslope from an area with a drainage
issue or problem, but should be located in a manner to address or alleviate the
drainage issue or problem.
      (4)    A Rain Garden shall not be installed in a location where it will
disturb existing root systems of trees.
      (5)    A Rain Garden must be setback at least eight (8) feet from the
rear property line.
      (6)    A Rain Garden must be setback at least five (5) feet from any
sideyard lot line.
      (7)    A Rain Garden shall cover no more than thirty percent (30%) of the
land located within the back yard of a property.
   (c)    No Rain Garden shall be constructed until a permit is obtained from
the Village Zoning Inspector. The applicant shall submit plans to the Village
that include a site plan showing (i) the dwelling structure in relation to the
property lines, (ii) the location of any downspout(s) proposed to be used for
the rain garden, and (iii) the dimensions of the Rain Garden, and (iv) the
depth of the Rain Garden. The dimensions and depth of a Rain Garden shall
comply with the standards established in the Rain Garden Manual for Homeowners
published by the Geauga Soil and Water Conservation District, which standards
are incorporated herein by reference as if fully rewritten.
   (d)    A Rain Garden must be maintained so that it shall not cause a public
or private nuisance. All landscaping materials must be maintained in good
condition, present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance, and be kept free of
weeds, refuse and debris. The owner of the property is responsible for
maintenance, repair and replacement of any landscape materials, fences, steps,
retaining walls or similar landscaping elements. Rain Gardens must be
maintained in good operating condition to promote the health of the plant
materials and the
capture of stormwater. Rain Garden maintenance shall include the following:
      (1)    Weekly weed removal during the first two months following initial
installation;
      (2)    Thereafter, monthly weeding during the remainder of the first year
following installation, not including the Winter months (December, January,
February and March);
      (3)    Following the first year, weeding at least once per year;
      (4)    Annual mulch replacement, to occur before June 1st of each year;
      (5)    Annual shrub pruning; and
      (6)    Watering of plants as necessary during Summer months (June, July,
August and September).
   (e)    A Rain Garden located within five (5) feet of a sideyard setback line
or eight feet of a rear property line must be cut or mowed to a height not
exceeding nine (9) inches in order to prevent the same from blooming or going
to seed.
   (f)    In the event that the owner does not maintain a Rain Garden in
accordance with the terms and requirements of this ordinance, the Village may
declare the Rain Garden a nuisance in accordance with Chapter
1313 of the Codified Ordinances, and may avail itself of the self-help remedies
set forth therein.

Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, as amended to
date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

1307.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Findings of Fact.  The Village of Middlefield has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (b)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (c)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (d)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Middlefield as identified in subsection (e) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by Village of Middlefield.
   (e)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Geauga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Geauga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective June 16, 2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Middlefield as required by Section
1307.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at 14860 North State Avenue Middlefield, Ohio 44062.
   (f)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (g)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (h)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Middlefield, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (i)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 09-
107. Passed 4-16-09.)
1307.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood:  The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE):  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development:  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway: A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Middlefield
Flood Insurance Rate Map, September 30, 1988, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.

   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.

the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement:  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 09-107. Passed 4-16-09.)

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1307.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1307.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1307.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Village of
Middlefield, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation / Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Middlefield have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that
Middlefield's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village of
Middlefield boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
Village of Middlefield suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Middlefield has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1307.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1307.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Middlefield specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1307.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 09-107. Passed 4-16-09.)
1307.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Village of Middlefield Planning Commission is hereby appointed
to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by Village
Code.
         (Ord. 09-107. Passed 4-16-09; Ord. 13-150. Passed 1-9-14.)
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in 14860 North
State Avenue Middlefield, Ohio 44062.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
 1307.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 14 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.  
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Public Hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (3)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1307.05(d)(2)A.1. to 11. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Geauga County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 09-107. Passed 4-16-09.)
1307.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1307.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Section
1307.03(c).
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1307.03(c).
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall

order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;

of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action, which,
if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this
notice and order shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner,
occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to
the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties.  Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a minor misdemeanor. Any
person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided
by the laws of the Village of Middlefield. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the Village of Middlefield from taking such other lawful action as is necessary
to prevent or remedy any violation. The Village of Middlefield shall prosecute
any violation of these regulations in accordance with the penalties stated
herein. (Ord. 09-107. Passed 4-16-09.)

shall stay the order being appealed from during the pendency of the appeal
unless immediate abatement of the Nuisance is necessary to protect the health,
safety or welfare of the community. If no timely appeal is received, it will be
conclusively presumed that the Nuisance occurred and the order shall be final.
Any associated costs shall be certified to the County Auditor as a lien against
the property at issue and any subject Certificate of Occupancy shall be

to timely pay will result in certification of the costs to the County Auditor
for collection as other taxes and assessments are collected. The Village shall
immediately revoke a Certificate of Occupancy after so ordered by the Planning
Commission or immediately after Council declares the use a Nuisance.
   (e)   A written decision shall not be found against an owner of a rental
property who establishes by a preponderance of evidence:

premises and could not, with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the
Nuisance activities on the premises; and
      (2)   Upon receipt of notice of the occurrence of Nuisance activities on
the premises, he or she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the
Nuisance including, without limitation, compliance with requirements of Ohio

   Within thirty (30) calendar days of the action being performed, the Village
shall serve the Responsible Party an order to pay costs, which shall include a
statement of the amount of costs incurred and an explanation of the appeals
process set forth in Section
1313.10 herein. The order shall additionally state that failure to pay within
