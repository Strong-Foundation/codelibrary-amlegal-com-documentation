AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; AND TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER,
AND TO DECLARE AN EMERGENCY IN THE VILLAGE OF GOLF MANOR, OHIO.
   WHEREAS,    the Council of the Village of Golf Manor, Ohio, has had the
matter of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for
some time; and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company, to prepare and publish such codification; and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
   NOW, THEREFORE, Be It Ordained by the Council of the Village of Golf Manor,
Hamilton County, Ohio, that:
   SECTION I. The ordinances of the Village of Golf Manor, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Golf Manor, Ohio, 1996.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct

   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or

continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). A separate offense
shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or
occurs.

131.01 SICK LEAVE, PERSONAL LEAVE AND INJURY LEAVE.
   (a)   Sick Leave.
      (1)   Accumulation and Use. Each full time employee of the Village shall
be entitled to two and five-tenths hours of sick leave for every forty (40)
hours of credited service. Sick leave shall be charged in minimum units of one-
half hour and shall be paid in accordance with the employee's base pay for each
one-half hour charged for absence from previously scheduled work. Sick leave
may be accumulated without limit.
      (2)   Notification.  An employee who is unable to report for work and who
is not on previously approved day of vacation, sick leave, personal leave or
leave of absence, shall be responsible for notifying the Department Supervisor
and/or Village Administrator that they will be unable to report for work. The
time required for such notification shall be established by each Department's
Supervisor and may be amended from time to time, both with the concurrence and
approval of the Village Administrator.
      (3)   Use of Sick Leave. Employees may use sick leave for the following
reasons:
         A.   Illness, injury or pregnancy related conditions of the employee;
         B.   Exposure of the employee to a contagious disease which could be
communicated to other employees;
         C.   Medical examination of the employee, including medical,
psychological, dental or optical examination by an appropriate practitioner;
         D.   Death of a member of the employee's immediate family, however,
such absence from work shall not exceed five (5) days, unless otherwise
approved by the Department's Supervisor and Village Administrator;
         E.   Illness, injury or pregnancy related condition of a member of the
employee's immediate family;
         F.   Medical examination, including medical, psychological, dental or
optical examination of a member of the employee's immediate family;
         G.   Immediate family as used in this section shall include father,
mother, sister, brother, husband, wife and child; and in subsections (a)(3)D
and E hereof shall also include stepchild, mother-in-law, father-in-law,
daughter-in-law, son-in-law, stepmother, stepfather, grandparents, grandchild
or other persons, in the opinion of the Village Administrator, who hold a
significant place in the life of the employee.
      (4)   Evidence of Use. Employees may be required to furnish a
satisfactory written, signed statement by appropriate practitioner to justify
use of sick leave. For extended sick leave, exceeding three consecutive work
days, the employee shall provide a physician's statement specifying the
employee's inability to report for work and the probable day of recovery or
return to duty with any appropriate restrictions. The Village as required by
law will attempt reasonable accommodations on a return to duty. Provided,
however the Village shall not be obligated to create a light duty position, nor
any new position of employment to accommodate a limited return to duty.
      (5)   Repeated Use of Sick Leave.  When an employee repeatedly takes one
day of sick leave, the day before or the day after said employee's day(s) off,
without statement of inability to work by an appropriate practitioner, and when
the accumulation of such day(s) taken the day before or the day after the
employee's day(s) off exceed five (5) days within a calendar year, the employee
shall not be granted sick leave for any additional day(s) the day before or the
day after the employee day(s) off unless certification of inability to work is
presented to the Village Administrator by a duly licensed physician or medical
authority, or previously approved by the Department Supervisor and the Village
Administrator.
      (6)   Abuse. Any employee who fails to comply with the sick leave
policies set out within this chapter, or who applies for sick leave with the
intent to defraud the Village, shall not be granted sick leave credit against
the accumulated sick leave for such absence from regularly scheduled work.
      (7)   Payment for Unused Sick Leave.
         A.   Upon an employee's death, disability retirement, service
retirement or permanent separation from service with the Village, provided such
employee has ten (10) or more years of service accumulated with the Village,
the State or any political subdivision, the Village of Golf Manor shall pay up
to one-fourth of the accumulated and unused sick leave, not to exceed a payment
for three hundred sixty (360) hours of base pay, based upon one thousand four
hundred forty (1,440) hours of accumulated sick leave.
         B.   If an employee should leave the services of the Village for any
reason and is paid for the unused sick leave as stated above, and such employee
is reinstated into the services of the Village, then previous sick leave credit
accumulated and not paid prior to such separation from service shall not be
reinstated and the employee shall begin with a zero accumulated sick leave
unless otherwise approved by the Village Administrator and Village Council as
an offer of re-employment.
   (b)    Personal Leave. Each full time employee of the Village shall be
eligible for personal leave as follows:
      (1)   Each employee employed as of the first of the year shall be
entitled to thirty-two (32) hours of personal leave for the year. Employees
hired after the first of the year shall be entitled to thirty-two (32) hours of
personal leave, less nine-tenths (0.9) of one hour for each two (2) week period
past the first of the year when employment begins.
      (2)   Personal leave shall be charged in the minimum units of one-half
(½) hour per one-half (½) hour's absence from regularly scheduled employment
for personal leave paid at the employee's base pay rate.
      (3)   Notification. With exception of emergencies, use of personal leave
shall be approved by appropriate Department Supervisor and Village
Administrator with reasonable notice in advance as set by the policies and
procedures of the Department.
      (4)   Use of Personal Leave. Employees may use personal leave for the
following:
         A.   Personal Court Appearance;
         B.   Legal or business matters;
         C.   Family emergencies;
         D.   Unusual family obligations;
         E.   Religious holidays; or
         F.   Any matter of a personal nature.
      (5)   Unused Personal Leave.  Employees having accumulated personal leave
at year's end, being the final day of the last pay period of the calendar year,
shall either:
         A.   Carry forward the balance of personal leave;
         B.   Convert the balance of personal leave to accumulated sick leave
on an hour for hour basis;
         C.   Receive a cash payment for unused personal leave at the rate of
one hour base pay for every two (2) hours accumulated personal leave; or
         D.   Gift such personal leave to the Employee Donation Bank as
permitted herein.
The employee will state the option chosen in writing and present it to the
Village Administrator no later than the final day of the last pay period of the
calendar year.
      (6)   Employees who leave the services of the Village during the year
shall not be eligible for payment of accumulated, unused personal leave.
   (c)   Occupational Injury Leave.
      (1)   In most situations, the Village utilizes pay continuation along
with Worker's Compensation administration to ensure an employee's continuity of
income during an occupational injury. When necessary, each full-time employee
shall be entitled to Occupational Injury Leave ("OIL") to a maximum of one
hundred twenty (120) calendar days for each qualifying injury. OIL may be
granted to an employee who suffers an on-the-job injury from an identifiable
incident that occurred in the course of performance of the employee's official
duties within the scope of employment with the Village, or where such injury
directly results from an exposure to a hazard and who is off word due to said
injury for a continuous period of five (5) working days. The Village may decide
to waive the requirement to use sick leave during the initial five day period.
      (2)   In the event of a service connected injury incurred in the active
discharge of duty, particular to police work and not characteristic of other
occupations, which injury is not the result of negligence, recklessness, self-
infliction, or "horseplay" by the employee, the Village shall grant the
employee full pay for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) calendar
days. This time shall not be charged to the employee's sick time. Upon written
request of the employee, the Village may grant a thirty (30) day extension of
the OIL.
      (3)   An employee applying for OIL hereunder, shall authorize the release
to the Village of all medical information pertinent only to the occupational
injury possessed by the employee's treating physician(s) and the treatment
facility(ies) if so requested by the Village or its designee, and/or shall
agree to be examined by a licensed medical practitioner selected and paid for
by the Village.
      (4)   Any employee claiming an occupational injury under this section
shall file an injury claim with the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation
("OBWC") as soon as possible. Upon approval of the claim by OBWC, an OIL
granted after the fifth (5th) day of absence shall be made retroactive to the
first (1st) day of absence, and any sick leave or vacation used by the employee
during the first five (5) days of absence shall be restored to the employee's
credit. The employee shall remit to the Village all income benefits paid by
OBWC for the period during which the employee received full pay from the
Village while on OIL. In the event the claim is denied by OBWC, the employee
shall revert to sick leave status, and shall be charged with sick leave and/or
vacation leave for all time paid by the Village for OIL.
      (5)   It is understood and agreed that the Village's obligation under
this section is only the difference between the employee's regular rate of pay
and the amount of income benefits paid to the employee by OBWC, and that OIL is
not in lieu of OBWC benefits.
      (6)   In lieu of granting OIL, the Village may assign the employee to
light duty with the approval of, and within the limitations set by, the
employee's treating physician or physician selected and paid for by the
Village. It is strictly the management right of the Village to determine if
light duty work is available.
      (7)   No entitlement to OIL shall arise from a personal injury sustained
while an employee is engaged in private employment of any nature whether or not
such private employment is a peace officer guard, or other law enforcement
related field, and whether or not such private employment was secured through
the Village.
      (8)   Before an employee on injury leave will be permitted to return to
duty, the employee shall submit to the Village Administrator a physician's
statement and any other required documentation concerning the injury,
demonstrating the employee's physical ability to satisfactorily perform the
duties of the employee's position. Additionally, the Village Administrator may
require the employee to submit to an examination by a physician selected and
paid by the Village if there is any question about the employee's ability to
return to duty.
   (d)   Employee Donation Bank.
      (1)   It is acknowledged that from time to time employees may suffer from
serious medical conditions preventing them from working for extended periods of
time, and the employee has no means of support because the employee has
exhausted all available paid leave and the employee's temporary total
disability is not work related and covered by Ohio Worker's Compensation law.
As a result, there is hereby created the Employee Donation Bank.
      (2)   Employees from time to time may donate accumulated but unused sick,
vacation or personal leave or compensatory time to the Employee Donation Bank
to be credited for use only by an employee actively drawing from such Employee
Donation Bank at the time of such donation.
      (3)   An employee who is (1) unable to work due to an injury or illness,
(2) who has exhausted his/her available sick leave, vacation leave, and
personal time during a calendar year, and who is not receiving Worker's
Compensation Benefits related to such leave, is eligible to request continuing
payment of his/her regular pay from the Employee Donation Bank. If an employee
is determined to be eligible to draw from the Bank, as determined by the
Department Supervisor and the Village Administrator, such employee shall be
paid his/her regular compensation for each eligible hour that the employee is
absent which has been donated in advance of such day of absence to the Employee
Donation Bank designated for the benefit of such employee. If sufficient hours
have not been donated for such employee in advance, such employee shall be paid
only those hours credited as donations within the Bank for such employee. An
eligible employee may only draw up to a total of four hundred eighty (480)
hours from the Employee Donation Bank during his/her term of employment with
the Village, unless otherwise approved by Council. Such hours, up to the total
of four hundred eighty (480), may be drawn on intermittent basis.
         (Ord. 2019-9. Passed 7-15-19.)
131.02 HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.
   In addition to their compensation, all full time employees of the Village of
Golf Manor shall be eligible to receive major medical and hospitalization
insurance coverage paid by the Village in the amount of ninety-two percent
(92%) of their total health insurance premiums.
   For new employees, these benefits shall begin following any waiting period
and shall be subject to any deductibles established within the covered
contract.

   (c)   An employee may accumulate and carry forward to future vacation years
no more than eighty (80) hours total of unused vacation time no matter when
earned.
   (d)   Holidays.  If a holiday falls within a scheduled vacation period, the
holiday shall not be credited as a vacation day for such employee.
   (e)   Terminations. An individual terminating employment with the Village
who has completed more than nine (9) months service shall receive full pay for
vacation earned but not taken prior to such separation from employment.
   (f)   Vacation Scheduling.

issued by the Village Administrator and Department Supervisor.
      (2)   Permanent employees who are entitled to one hundred twenty (120)
hours of vacation or more shall be limited to a maximum use of one hundred
twenty (120) consecutive hours of vacation at any given time unless pre-

   (g)   All new hirees shall be given credit for service completed with
another municipality or agency of the State of Ohio or other public employment
in determining eligibility and entitlement to vacation as accruing in
accordance with this section.
   (h)   Probationary employees, except as hereinafter set forth, shall not be
entitled to accrue any vacation during their probationary period. After an
employee has served six (6) months from his or her date of original hire as a
full-time employee, that employee shall be entitled to forty (40) hours of
vacation. This six (6) month accrual applies to all employees including Police
Department personnel despite the twelve (12) month probationary period for
Police Department new hirees. The probationary employee restriction against
vacation accrual shall not apply to the probationary period applicable to
promotions from within the Village, nor shall such restriction apply if
negotiated by the Village Administrator as an offer of hire and approved by
Village Council.

compensation, and such employee is within a job classification entitled to
overtime compensation.
(Ord. 2019-9. Passed 7-15-19.)

for a Police Department employee during the calendar year, a Police Department
employee shall be credited with holiday time equal to eight (8) hours of his or
her regular pay for holidays scheduled during the calendar year, or during the
balance of the calendar year after employment. This holiday time may be taken
by a police employee at any time during the calendar year upon the request of
the employee to the Chief of Police, which request will be reviewed, and

time may be accumulated to be carried over from one calendar year to another,
and any holiday time which has not been used during the calendar year shall be
paid to the Police Department employee during the last month of the calendar
year, issued as a separate compensation payment. This additional compensation
shall be equivalent to the employee's then hourly rate times eight (8) hours
per day times the number of holidays to be credited and paid. If an employee of
the Police Department shall separate from service by resignation, retirement or
other involuntary termination then that employee shall forfeit and not be
entitled to receive any accumulated, but unused holiday compensation for the
remainder of the calendar year. If at the time of separation from service an
employee has been credited and used holiday time in excess of the actual
calendar holidays as recognized above at the time of separation, then the
excess holiday time used shall be deducted from any accumulated but unused
vacation time due to be paid under Section
131.03 (e) herein.

be prorated over the number of weeks he/she has been employed during that
current year with the Village of Golf Manor from his/her previous anniversary

compensation upon his/her termination of employment prior to his/her fifth
(5th) anniversary date of employment with the Village of Golf Manor.

apportionment percentage formula to be determined by:
         A.   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property rented
or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in such municipal corporation to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession,

taxable by the municipal corporation under Section 718.011 of the Ohio Revised
Code;
         C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made in
such municipal corporation during the taxable period to gross receipts of the
business or profession during the same period from sales and services, wherever
made or performed.
         D.   Adding together the percentages determined in accordance with
subsections A. B. and C. above, or such of the aforesaid percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer, and dividing the total so obtained by
the number of percentages used in deriving said total.
            1.   A factor is applicable even though it may be apportioned
entirely in or outside the municipality.
            2.   Provided that in the event a just and equitable result cannot
be obtained under the business apportionment percentage formula provided for
herein, the Board of Review, upon application of the taxpayer or the Tax
Commissioner, shall, under uniform regulation adopted by the Board, have the
authority to substitute other factors or methods calculated to effect a fair
and proper apportionment.

municipal corporation regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered
from a stock of goods within such municipal corporation;

municipal corporation regardless of where title passes even though transported
from a point outside such municipal corporation if the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees and/or agents in the solicitation or
promotion of sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from
such solicitation or promotion;
      (3)    All sales of tangible personal property shipped from a place
within such municipal corporation to purchasers outside such municipal
corporation regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through
its own employees and/or agents, regularly engaged in the solicitation or
promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
   (d)    Net Operating Loss (NOL) Carry Forward.
      (1)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
apportioned to the municipality may be applied against the portion of the
profit of succeeding tax years apportioned to the municipality, until
exhausted, but in no event for more than the five (5) taxable years immediately
following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
      (2)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained shall be apportioned
to the municipality in the same manner as provided herein for apportioning net
profits to the municipality.
      (3)    The Tax Commissioner shall provide by rules and regulations the
manner in which such net operating loss carry-forward shall be determined.
      (4)    The net operating loss of a taxpayer that loses its legal
identity, by any means such as merger or consolidation, shall not be allowed as
a carry forward loss deduction to the surviving or new taxpayer.
      (5)    The net operating loss sustained by a business or profession is
not deductible from employee earnings, but may be carried forward as provided
in subsection (d)(1). However, if a taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable
business activities to be included in the same return, the net loss of one
unincorporated business activity (except any portion of a loss reportable for
municipal income tax purposes to another municipality) may be used to offset
the profits of another for purposes of arriving at overall net profits.
   (e)   Consolidated Returns. 
      (1)    Filing of consolidated returns may be permitted or required in
accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Tax Commissioner.
      (2)    In the case of a corporation that carried on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, the Tax Commissioner shall
require such information, in addition to the return hereinafter provided for,
as he may deem necessary to ascertain whether net profits are properly
allocated to the municipality. If the Tax Commissioner finds net profits are
not properly allocated to the municipality by reason of transactions with
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, he may require the filing of a
consolidated return or adjust such transactions so as to produce a fair and
proper allocation of net profits to the municipality.
   (f)   Exceptions. The provisions of the chapter shall not be construed as
levying a tax upon the following:
      (1)   Proceeds from welfare benefits, unemployment insurance benefits,
pensions, social security benefits, and qualified retirement plans as defined
by the Internal Revenue Service.
      (2)    Proceeds of insurance, annuities, Workers' Compensation insurance,
permanent disability benefits, compensation for damages for personal injury and
like reimbursements, not including damages for loss of profits and wages.

the preceding paragraph receiving income from non-exempt real estate, tangible
or intangible personal property, or business activities of a type ordinarily
conducted for profit by taxpayers operating for profit shall not be excluded
hereunder.
      (11)   In the event any association or organization receives taxable
income as provided in the preceding paragraph from real or personal property

compensation in excess of one thousand dollars may be subjected to taxation.
The payer of such compensation is not required to withhold municipal tax from
that compensation.
      (15)    Compensation paid to an employee of a transit authority, regional
transit authority, or a regional transit commission created under Chapter 306
of the Ohio Revised Code for operating a transit bus or other motor vehicle for
the authority or commission in or through the municipality, unless the bus or
vehicle is operated on a regularly scheduled route, the operator is subject to
such tax by reason of residence or domicile in the municipality, or the
headquarter of the authority or commission is located within the municipality.
      (16)    The Municipality shall not tax the compensation paid to a
nonresident individual for personal services performed by the individual in the
municipality on twelve (12) or fewer days in a calendar year unless one of the
following applies:
         A.   The individual is an employee of another person, the principal
place of business of the individual's employer is located in another
municipality in Ohio that imposes a tax applying to compensation paid to the
individual for services paid on those days; and the individual is not liable to
that other municipality for tax on the compensation paid for such services.
         B.   The individual is a professional entertainer or professional
athlete, the promoter of a professional entertainment or sports event, or an
employee of such promoter, all as may be reasonably defined by the
municipality.
      (17)    The income of a public utility, when that public utility is
subject to the tax levied under Section 5727.24 or 5727.30 of the Ohio Revised
Code, except a municipal corporation may tax the following, subject to Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
         A.   The income of an electric company or combined company;
         B.   The income of a telephone company.
   As used in subsection (f)(17) of this section, “combined company”, “electric
company”, and "telephone company" have the same meanings as in Section 5727.01
of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (18)    Generally the above noted items in this section are the only
forms of income not subject to the tax. Any other income, benefits, or other
forms of compensation shall be taxable.
         (Ord. 2005-2. Passed 3-28-05.)
151.04 EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   The tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation earned, and shall be
levied with respect to the net profits of the persons, businesses, professions,
or other activities earned or received from and after the effective date of
this Tax Code.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 3-28-05.)
151.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Dates and Exemptions.
      (1)   On or before April 30 in each year prior to the tax year 2004 and
April 15 of each year thereafter, the following persons shall make and file a
return with the Tax Commissioner:
         A.   Each person who engages in business or other activity, or whose
qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income is
subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, whether or not a tax is due
thereon.
         B.   Each resident who engages in business or other activity, or whose
qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation and other taxable income is
subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, whether or not a tax is due
thereon.
      (2)    When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period
different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following the end of such fiscal
year or period. The Tax Commissioner is hereby authorized to provide by
regulation that the return of an employer or employers, showing the amount of
municipal tax deducted by said employer or employers from the salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation of an employee, and paid by him or them to
the Tax Commissioner may be accepted as the return required of any employee
whose sole income, subject to tax under this Tax Code, is such qualifying wage,
commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income.
      (3)    Filings, including requests for extensions, must be received in
the office of the Tax Commissioner by the due date.
   (b)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint return
for municipal purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable
income nor deductions included on the municipal return regardless of whether
their federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a joint
Village return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable
income and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
   (c)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Commissioner; or on a
generic form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of
the information required to be submitted with the municipality's prescribed
return and, if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form
otherwise complies with the Tax Code governing the filing of returns.
   (d)   The return shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions, and other
compensation earned, received, apportioned or set aside, other income defined
by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession or other
activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross
income, earned during the preceding year and subject to said tax; and
      (2)    The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)    Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the Tax
Commissioner may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used in the return for federal income tax, adjusted to
set forth only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
   (e)   Extensions.  
      (1)    Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of the municipality's
tax return. The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the
taxpayer's request for a federal filing extension with the Tax Commissioner.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to file a federal income tax return may
request an extension for filing the municipality's tax return in writing.
      (3)    The request for extension must be filed on or before the original
due date for the annual return. If the request is granted, the extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the last day of the month
following the month to which the due date of the federal income tax return has
been extended.
      (4)    The Tax Commissioner may deny a taxpayer's request for extension
if the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request;
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request (if
applicable);
         C.   Owes the municipality any delinquent income tax or any penalty,
interest, assessment or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of
income tax;
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (5)    The granting of an extension for filing a municipal income tax
return does not extend the due date as provided in this section for paying of
the tax; hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the
period of extension at the rate set out by Section
151.10. Interest but no penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the
return is filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all
other filing and payment requirements of the Tax Code have been met. Any
extension by the Tax Commissioner shall be granted upon the condition that
declaration filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if,
upon further examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and
payment requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be
assessed in full and in the same manner as though no extension had been
granted.
   (f)   Payments with Returns.  
      (1)    The taxpayer making a return shall at the time of the filing
thereof pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided that where the source, pursuant to the provisions of Section
151.06 of this chapter; or where any portion of the tax shall have been paid by
the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
151.07 of this chapter, or where an income tax, accreditable against the
municipal tax pursuant to Section
151.12 hereof has been paid to another municipality, credit for the amount so
paid shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if
any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing said return.
      (2)    A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the
municipality is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his
election indicated on the return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be
refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than $1.01 shall
be collected or refunded.
   (g)   Amended Returns.  
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Sections
151.11 and
151.12. The Tax Commissioner shall provide by regulation the format in which
such amended return shall be filed. A taxpayer may not change the method of
accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.
      (2)    Within three (3) months from the final determination of any
federal tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipality tax based upon such final determination of federal tax
liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for
refund of any overpayment.
         (Ord. 2005-2. Passed 3-28-05.)
151.06 COLLECTION AT THE SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding by Employer. Each employer within, or doing business
within, the Municipality who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage,
commission or other compensation basis shall deduct, when such salary, wage,
commission or other compensation is paid, allocated or set aside, the tax of
one and seven tenths percent (1.7%) on the qualifying wages due by such
employer to each such employee and shall make a return and payment to the Tax
Commissioner the amount of taxes so deducted.
      (1)   Employers who withhold taxes imposed by this chapter which exceed
$200.00 per month or $2,400 per year for all employees shall, on or before the
fifteenth day of each month make a return and pay to the Tax Commissioner the
amount of taxes deducted during the preceding month.
      (2)    All other employers shall, on or before the last day of April,
July, October, and January of each year make a return and pay to the Tax
Commissioner the amount of taxes deducted during the preceding calendar
quarter. The Tax Commissioner may revoke the approval of quarterly filing and
payments whenever the Tax Commissioner has reason to believe that the
conditions for granting such authorization have changed, were judged
incorrectly, were not met, or when it is in the best interest of the
Municipality to do so. Notice of withdrawal shall be made in writing and, in
such case, the employer must begin to file in accordance with this section.
      (3)    Each employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required
to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been
withheld. Nothing in this section prohibits an employer from withholding tax on
a basis greater than qualifying wages.
      (4)    An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect
to an individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if,
at the time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee
of the corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (b)    (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (c)   Employer Considered as Trustee. Each employer in collecting said tax
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
municipality, as a trustee for the benefit of the municipality, and any such
tax collected by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid
to the municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer. Each
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (d)   Corporation Officers Personal Liability. Any person who is required to
withhold tax from qualifying wages shall pay all such tax to the municipality
in accordance with the provisions of this section. In the event taxes withheld
from the qualifying wages of employees are not paid to the municipality in
accordance with the provisions of this section, all officers, members,
managers, employees, and trustees having control or supervision of or charged
with the responsibility of filing the return and making payment are jointly and
severally personally liable for the tax not returned or paid to the
municipality as well as any related interest and penalties, and are also liable
under the provisions of Section
151.12  hereof. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an
officer's, partner’s, member's, manager's, employee's, or trustee's liability
for a failure of the corporation, limited liability company, or business trust
to file returns or pay said taxes.
   (e)   Employees Listings. Each employer shall file a withholding tax
reconciliation (Form W-3) showing the sum total of all compensation paid all
employees, the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding along
with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to
withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted. Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the
municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social
security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year and the amount of municipal tax withheld. If the total tax
withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the municipality concerning each employee. The withholding tax
reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28
following the end of such calendar year.
   (f)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the municipality when the services were performed
in the municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and social security number (or federal identification
number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal Form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (g)   Domestic Servants. No person shall be required to withhold the tax on
the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation and other taxable income
paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such person's
residence. However, such domestic servants shall be responsible for filing and
paying their own returns and taxes.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 3-28-05.)
151.07 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Requirement for Filing. Every person who anticipates any taxable
income which is not subject to Section
151.06  hereof, or engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
resulting in income subject to the tax imposed by this chapter shall file a
declaration setting forth such estimated income or the estimated profit or loss
from such business activity, together with the estimated tax due thereon, if
any. Provided, however, if a person's income is wholly from qualifying wages
from which the tax will be held and remitted to this municipality in accordance
with Section
151.06 , such person need not file a declaration.
   (b)   Dates for Filing.  
      (1)   Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of each year
during the life of this chapter, or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of
the fourth (4th) month following the date the taxpayer first becomes subject to
the provisions of this section.
      (2)    Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
following the start of each fiscal year or period.
   (c)   Forms - Credit for Tax Withheld or Paid Another Community. 
      (1)    The declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by,
obtainable from the Tax Commissioner or an acceptable generic form. Credit
shall be taken for municipal tax to be withheld from any portion of such
income. Credit may be taken for tax to be paid to or to be withheld and
remitted to another taxing municipality in accordance with Section
151.14.
      (2)    A declaration of estimated tax to be paid the municipality shall
be accompanied by a payment of at least 1/4 of the estimated tax, less credit
for taxes withheld or paid to another municipality, and at least a similar
amount shall be paid on or before fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th)
month and the last day of the seventh, tenth and thirteenth months after the
beginning of the tax year.
   (d)   Amended Declaration. 
      (1)   A declaration may be amended at any time, provided that in case an
amended declaration is filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall be
paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
      (2)    If it appears that the original declaration and accompanying
payments made for such year underestimated the taxpayer's income by 30% or
more, the difference between 70% of the taxpayer's tax liability and the amount
of estimated tax he actually paid on or before December 31, or the date fixed
by regulation, whichever is applicable, shall be subject to the interest and
penalty provisions of Section
151.10 hereof.
   (e)   Annual Return Required. On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
fourth month following the end of the calendar or fiscal year following that
for which the declaration was filed, an annual return shall be filed and any
balance which may be due the municipality shall be paid therewith in accordance
with the provisions of Section
151.05  hereof.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 3-28-05.)
151.08  DUTIES OF TAX COMMISSIONER.
   (a)   Collection and Maintenance Responsibility.  
      (1)    There is hereby created an income tax bureau for the
administration of the provisions of this chapter. Such bureau shall consist of
a Tax Commissioner, Deputy Tax Commissioner and such clerical personnel as may
be determined to be necessary for the administration of this chapter. All such
personnel shall be appointed by the Service Director except that the Tax
Commissioner shall be appointed by the Mayor with the consent of the Council.
      (2)    It shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner to collect and
receive the tax imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed therein, and
to keep an accurate record thereof, and to report all monies so received.
      (3)    It shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner to enforce payment of
all income taxes owing the municipality, to keep accurate records for a minimum
of six (6) years, showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to file a
declaration or make any return, including a return of taxes withheld, and to
show the date and amounts of payments thereof.
   (b)   Enforcement Authority. The Tax Commissioner is hereby charged with the
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including the interpretation and
enforcement of the rules and regulations, and is hereby empowered, subject to
the approval of the Board of Review, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce
rules and regulations authorized or required by this chapter, relating to any
matter or thing pertaining to the collection and payment of taxes and the
administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including
provisions for the examination and correction of returns.
   The Tax Commissioner, or any of his authorized agents, is authorized to
arrange for the payment of unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties on a schedule
of installment payments, when the taxpayer has proved to the Tax Commissioner
that, due to certain hardship conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount
of the tax due. The authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are
filed by the taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under this chapter. Failure
to make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total amount unpaid,
including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand, and the provisions
of Sections
151.10,
151.11 and
151.99 shall apply.
   (c)   Determination of Taxes. In any case where a taxpayer has failed to
file a return or has filed a return which does not show the proper amount of
tax due, the Tax Commissioner may determine the amount of tax appearing to be
due the municipality from the taxpayer and may send to such taxpayer a written
statement showing the amount of tax so determined, together with interest and
penalties thereon, if any.
   (d)   Compromise Authority. Subject to the consent of the Board of Review or
pursuant to regulation approved by the Board of Review, the Tax Commissioner
shall have the power to compromise any tax liability imposed by this chapter.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed -3-29-02.)
151.09  INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF THE TAX COMMISSIONER; PENALTY FOR DIVULGING
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (a)   Examination of Taxpayers Records. The Tax Commissioner, or any of his
authorized agents, is authorized to examine the books, papers, records and
federal income tax returns of any employer, or taxpayer, or any person subject
to, or whom the Tax Commissioner believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made, or if no
return was made, to ascertain the tax or withholdings due under this chapter.
Every such employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer is hereby
directed and required to furnish, upon written request of the Tax Commissioner,
or his duly authorized agent or employees, the means, facilities and
opportunity for making such examinations and investigations as are hereby
authorized.
   (b)   Investigative Questionnaires. The Tax Commissioner may require any
taxpayer, or any person whom the Commissioner may reasonably presume to be
required to file a return or pay a tax, to complete and return a questionnaire
from which the Commissioner may determine whether such person shall be required
to file a return or pay a tax. In said questionnaire the Commissioner may
demand information concerning residency, income, sources of income, and any
other information that bears upon the question of taxability.
   (c)   Appearance Orders to Taxpayers. The Tax Commissioner is hereby
authorized to order any person, presumed to have knowledge of the facts, to
appear at the office of the Tax Commissioner and to examine such person, under
oath, concerning any income which was or should have been returned for
taxation, or withheld, or any transaction tending to affect such income, and
for this purpose may compel the production of books, papers, records and
federal, state, county and municipal income tax returns, and the attendance of
all persons before him, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he believes
such persons have knowledge of such income or information pertinent to such
inquiry.
   (d)   Result of Refusal to Submit Information. The refusal to produce books,
papers, records and federal income tax returns, or to complete a taxpayer
questionnaire, or the refusal to submit to such examination by any employer or
person subject, or presumed to be subject, to the tax or by any officer, agent
or employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax, or the
failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or with an
order or subpoena of the Tax Commissioner authorized hereby, shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter punishable as provided in Section
151.12  hereof.
   (e)   Retention of Records by Taxpayer. Every taxpayer shall retain all
records necessary to compute his tax liability for a period of six (6) years
from the date his return is filed or the taxes required to be withheld are
paid.
   (f)   Confidential Nature of Information. Any information gained as a result
of any returns, investigations, questionnaires, hearings or verifications
required or authorized by this chapter shall be confidential, and no disclosure
thereof shall be made except to municipal, county, state or federal taxing
agencies, or, except for official purposes as the Village Solicitor shall
determine, or except in accordance with proper judicial order. Any person
divulging such information in violation of this section shall be fined not more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000) and imprisoned not more than one hundred
eighty days, or both, for each offense. Each disclosure shall constitute a
separate offense. In addition to the above penalty, any employee of the
municipality who violates the provisions of this section relative to the
disclosure of confidential information may be subject to disciplinary action
including immediate termination.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 3-28-05.)
151.10  INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Interest. All taxes imposed and monies withheld or required to be
withheld by employers under the provisions of this chapter, remaining unpaid
after they become due, shall bear interest at the rate of 1% per month.
   (b)   Penalties. In addition to interest as provided in subsection (a)
hereof, penalties for failure to file tax returns in a timely manner, failure
to pay taxes and to withhold and remit taxes pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   In the case of taxpayers failing to file a return required by this
chapter within the time frames set forth herein, and including any lawfully
permitted extensions, the taxpayer shall pay a penalty of $25.00 upon a first
offense, $50.00 upon a second offense, $100.00 upon a third offense and $150.00
upon a fourth or any subsequent offense.
      (2)    In the case of taxpayers failing to pay the full amount of tax
due, a penalty as follows:
         A.   A penalty of 1% per month, or fraction thereof, of the amount of
the unpaid tax, if the tax is paid during the first six months after the tax
became due;
         B.   A penalty of 2% per month, or fraction thereof, of the amount of
the unpaid tax, if the tax is paid during the seventh and twelfth month after
the tax became due; and
         C.   A penalty of 4% per month, or fraction thereof, of the amount of
the unpaid tax, if the tax is paid later than 12 months after it became due.
The percentages herein specified, when used, shall apply from the first month
of delinquency.
   (c)   Exceptions. A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax
assessment made by the Tax Commissioner when a return has been filed in good
faith and the tax paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Tax
Commissioner; and provided that, in the absence of fraud, neither penalty nor
interest shall be assessed on any additional tax assessment resulting from a
federal audit, providing an amended return is filed and the additional tax is
paid within three (3) months after final determination of the federal tax
liability.
   (d)   Abatement by Board of Review. No abatement or reduction in any penalty
or interest imposed under this chapter shall be made unless by the Board of
Review and pursuant to the provisions of Section
151.13  of this Code. An appeal seeking an abatement or reduction in any
penalty or interest shall be taken within 30 days from the imposition of such
penalty or interest and the Board shall, upon hearing, have jurisdiction to
afffirm, reverse or modify any such imposition of penalty or interest, or any
part thereof.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 3-28-05.)
151.11 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and
penalties thereon, by suit as other debts of like amount are recoverable. No
additional assessment shall be made after three (3) years from the time of
payment of any tax due hereunder; provided however, there shall be no period of
limitation on an additional assessment in a case of a return that omits income
in excess of $10,000 for the tax year in question or in the case of filing a
false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, or in the case of
failure to file a return. In those cases in which the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the federal statute of
limitations the period within which an additional assessment may be made by the
Tax Commissioner shall be extended one (1) year from the time of the final
determination of the federal tax liability.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for such
refund has been filed within three (3) years from the date on which such
payment was made or the return was due, or within three (3) months after final
determination of the federal tax liability, whichever is later.
   (c)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return, ninety (90) days after the complete return is filed, or ninety (90)
days after an amendment is made in such return as a result of an appeal,
whichever is later, no interest shall be allowed on the refunded overpayment.
For purposes of computing the payment of interest on overpayments, no amount of
tax for any taxable year shall be treated as having been paid before the date
on which the tax return for that year was due without regard to any extension
of time for filing that return. The interest shall be paid at the rate of
interest prescribed by Ohio R.C. 5703.47.
(Ord. 2005-2. Passed 3-28-05.)
151.12 VIOLATIONS.

      (3)    Fail, neglect or refuse to pay the tax, penalties or interest

152.1.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
   As used in this chapter:
   (1)    "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation

income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:

income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or

an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;

the computation of federal taxable income;

that is reduced by exempt income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal
taxable income to zero, with any remaining unused portion of the net operating
loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following
the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years
than necessary for the deduction to be fully utilized.
         (ii)    No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H)

Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
section
 152.1.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)    In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also

corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   
   (B)    (1)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit
to the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld

to make payments under division (8)(1)(b) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (8)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
152.1.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying

disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)    (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall

withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (8)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;

tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (8)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to
that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that calendar year on
which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal services
performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
152.1.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (8)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement

same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)    (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
152.1.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
 152.1.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, courtmartial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section and except as
provided in division (I) of this section, reasonable receipts from sales and
rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation
as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)    The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)    (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)    An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
152.1.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
152.1.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net
profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a
taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that
municipal corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee
would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not
exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
152.1.05 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (A) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (I)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (D) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B)(1) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
152.1.05 of this Chapter.

152.1.063 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)    (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)    The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)    A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)    (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
 152.1.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
 152.1.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
152.1.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
152.1.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
152.1.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
152.1.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

152.1.064 TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT FOSTER NEW JOBS IN OHIO.
   The Municipality, by Ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.

derives from the retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term
not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.

estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for a municipal corporation's
income tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to a municipal

   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as
paid to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal
amounts on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which
all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

estimated taxes"
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division

152.1.091 of this Chapter or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month
of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the

      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)    (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;

taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
152.1.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)    For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)    An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)    (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
152.1.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
152.1.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that

factors.

152.1.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)    Limitation on amount paid. Every individual taxpayer who resides in
the Village and who receives salaries, wages, commissions, or other
compensation or net profits from sales made, work done or services performed or
rendered outside of the Village, if it be made to appear that he has paid a

final return unless such taxpayer's employer files with the Tax Commissioner a
list showing the tax withheld from taxpayer's wages, salaries, or commissions
for other municipalities.
(Ord. 2015-3. Passed 12-14-15.)
152.1.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)    (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without
regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a fraction the numerator of
which is the portion of such compensation on which the taxpayer has paid income
tax to one or more municipal corporations and the denominator of which is the
total amount of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
"qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)    (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)    If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)    (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 2015-3. Passed 12-14-15.)
152.1.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
 152.1.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2015-3. Passed 12-14-15.)
152.1.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
152.1.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)    Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
152.1.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)    No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
152.1.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)    Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
152.1.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 2015-3. Passed 12-14-15.)

   (F)    (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)    A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each

required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)    A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund

      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or

municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)    Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)    (1)    (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be

by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)    With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
152.1.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
 152.1.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
152.1.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)    (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.

before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
152.1.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation

amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.

return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a

expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)    The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)    The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement:
      "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within the municipal
corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during the taxable year.
If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation,
if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's resolutions,
ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of
perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2)
of this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year.
            Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax
administrator from performing an audit of the person.

otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.

which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (C)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order

section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or

   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.

152.1.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the
extended due date in the municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that
is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last
day of the taxable year to which the return relates.

   (C)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the
taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the Tax Administrator
grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's
municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the Tax
Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.

the taxpayer files the return or on or before the extended due date to file the
return, whichever occurs first.
   If a tax Administrator violates Subsection (F) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
   Subsection (F) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
subsection (A) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge
that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive
the extension under subsection (A) of this section or failed to file for an
extension under subsection (C) of this section.
   (G)    To the extent that any provision of subsections (A), (B), (C), (D),

152.1.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)    Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)    (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
152.1.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)    (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of
this section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or less, no refund
need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
152.1.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
         (Ord. 2015-3. Passed 12-14-15.)
152.1.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)    (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (8)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
 152.1.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
 152.1.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

152.1.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the

the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents

information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
152.1.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
 152.1.99 of this Chapter.

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity
or transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)    If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts
or omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
152.1.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-3. Passed 12-14-15.)
152.1.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)    (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail.
   Such alternative delivery method must be authorized by the person subject to
the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Board of Tax Review within sixty days
after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-3. Passed 12-14-15.)
152.1.18 BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)    (1)    The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code Chapter
718.
      (2)    The Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The three
members of the Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the Village of Golf
Manor, Ohio. Two members shall be appointed by the Village Council, which may
also appoint an alternate to serve as provided herein when there may be a
conflict, illness, temporary absence or similar reason. The Council appointees
may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the Village at any
time during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of
appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Village Mayor.
   This member may be an employee of the Municipality, but may not be the
director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other
similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or
any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the
Village Council shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms
that a member may serve should the member be reappointed by the Village
Council. The Board member appointed by the Village Manager shall serve at the
discretion of the Village Manager.
      (4)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the Village
Council may be removed by the Village Council as set forth in Section 718.11
(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the alternate
designated by Village Council temporarily shall serve in the place of a Council
appointed member's absence. The Village Manager shall appoint another
individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's place if the
Village Manager appointed member is absent. This appointment shall be subject
to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the appointment
of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within
sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first day of the hearing
unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the Board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs, and
shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Board of Tax
Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as needed by the
Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records available for
inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be securely maintained under the control of the Tax
Administrator. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax Review
created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body subject to
section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-3. Passed 12-14-15.)
152.1.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)    (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
152.1.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not
have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of
that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
152.1.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)    (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review created under
Section
152.1.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to
which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that
the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less
than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section
152.1.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)    No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-3. Passed 12-14-15.)
152.1.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)    Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Village Council
may adopt rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)    All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 2015-3. Passed.12-14-15.)
152.1.30 INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE GIVEN BY LANDLORD.
   (A)    Landlord Information Required. Every landlord who owns or controls

the property for 30 days or more, shall, within 30 days after a new tenant

   (C)    Penalty. A violation of this section shall be an offense punishable
by a fine not to exceed $150.00. (Ord. 2015-3. Passed 12-14-15.)
  152.1.31.1 FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF
CHAPTER.
   (A)    A taxpayer may elect to be subject to sections
152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances in lieu of the provisions set forth in
the remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)    The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator

      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to Sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, sections
152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances, and any applicable provision of Chapter
5703 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the

taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and the Village of its
termination of the election.
         (b)    A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to Sections

provisions set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (C)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections

      (1)    Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (D)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in Section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
 152.1.03 of the Village Codified Ordinances. (Ord. 2018-2. Passed 2-23-18.)
152.1.31.2  DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
 152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States
relating to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the
use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United
States relating to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the
term in Title LVII of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter
5703 of the Revised Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall
control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes
other laws of the United States related to federal income taxes. If a term is
defined in both this section and Section
152.1.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall
control for all uses of that term in Sections
152.1.31.1 to
 152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in Sections
152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
152.1.31.3 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017
net operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
Section
152.1.03(1) of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(l) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in Section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in Section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income al lowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under Section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
Section
152.1.31.7 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of Section
152.1.31.7 of the Codified Ordinances.
      If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that
has made the election described in division (47)(B) of Section
152.1.31.03 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded
partnership that has made the election described in division (23)(D) of Section
 152.1.31.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted
federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under Section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
152.1.31.03(47) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not
include natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter
5745. of the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or
trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a
taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
 152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal
income taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist
of an aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax
purposes. The tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as
the taxable year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for
federal income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable
years for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership,
or for a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
152.1.17 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 2018-2. Passed 2-23-18.)
152.1.31.3  APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the Village and that has made the election under Section
152.1.31.1 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
 152.1.041 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the Village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
 152.1.31.11 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(l) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
152.1.31.11 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(l)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(l) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the Village
as follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the Village only if, regardless of where title passes, the
property meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the Village from
a stock of goods located within the Village.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the Village from a location
outside the Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the Village.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the Village in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the Village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the Village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(I) and (34)(A)(v) of Section
152.1.03 of the Codified Ordinances by the Village or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the Village. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the Village any
amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay
tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the Village under
this section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

152.1.31.5 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

      (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or

the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month

filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(l) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with Section

the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(l) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable
year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section or a taxpayer

this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(l) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(l) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section
152.1.31.1 of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer
under division (B)(l) or (2) of Section
 152.1.063 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for
the remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under Section
152.1.31.1 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made
under this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of
the five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consol idated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner

   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
152.1.31.2 the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of Section
152.1.31.2 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
152.1.31.3 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the passthrough entity in the computation of the affiliated group's
net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or
loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate
taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
152.1.31.3 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in Section
152.1.31.3 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits
that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
 152.1.31.3 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit
from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Sections
152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to
the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for
any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an
affiliated group.

Sections
152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or
before the date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed,
collected, and paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an
assessment is issued under Section

income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(l) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined

      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of Section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
Section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:

ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.

dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
 152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may
impose a penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
152.1.31.1 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax
required to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty
equal to fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
 152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon
which the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains
information that on its face indicates that the return is substantially
incorrect, and the filing of the return in that manner is due to a position
that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent from the return to delay or
impede the administration of Sections
152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars
may be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding
the greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required
to be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a fa lse or fraudulent claim for a refund
under Section
152.1.31.12 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding
the greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
Section
152.1.31.11 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation
for the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
 
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
 
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
 
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
152.1.31.1 to
 152.1.31.16  of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed
to municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax
liability is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under
Section 718.83 of the Revised Code. (Ord. 2018-2. Passed 2-23-18.)
152.1.31.11 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under Sections
152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
152.1.31.12 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall
be no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a
return subj ect to assessment as required by Sections
152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in Section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of t he assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under Section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county. Immediately upon the
filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment against the taxpayer
assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment may be filed by the
clerk in a looseleaf book entitled "special judgments for municipal income
taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments. Execution shall
issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax commissioner, and all laws
applicable to sales on execution shall apply to sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per
annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the day the
commissioner issues
the assessment until the assessment is paid or until it is certified to the
attorney general for collection under Section 131.02 of the Revised Code,
whichever comes first. If the unpaid portion
of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for collection, the
entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at the rate per
annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date of
certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall be paid
in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an assessment
under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless
proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are instituted without
delay, the commissioner
may issue a jeopardy assessment against the taxpayer liable for the tax.
Immediately upon the issuance of the jeopardy assessment, the commissioner
shall file an entry with the clerk of the court of common pleas in the manner
prescribed by division (C) of this section. Notice of the jeopardy assessment
shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or the taxpayer's legal representative
in the manner provided in Section 5703.37 of the Revised Code within five days
of the filing of the entry with the clerk. The total amount assessed is
immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer assessed files a petition for
reassessment in accordance with division (B) of this section and provides
security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner and in an amount sufficient
to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment. Full or partial payment of the
assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's consideration of the petition
for reassessment.
   (F)    Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax
commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a decision of the board of
tax appeals or any court to which the determination or decision has been
appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the corrected
assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to the
taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section
152.1.31.12 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as
provided by that section.
(Ord. 2018-2. Passed 2-23-18.)
152.1.31.12 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed
with the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of Section
 152.1.31.11 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the
form prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in Section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with Section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under Section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by Section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. 2018-2. Passed 2-23-18.)
152.1.31.13 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under Section
152.1.31.1 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
Sections
152.1.31.1 to
 152.1.31.16  of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
152.1.31.11 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any
additional tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and
interest. The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject
to assessment that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
152.1.31.12  of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms
to the requirements of that section. An application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in Section
152.1.31.12 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return. (Ord. 2018-2. Passed 2-23-18.)
152.1.31.14 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
 152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the
accuracy of any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax
due as required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner
or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections
 152.1.31.1 to
152.1.31.16 of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the

      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the Village and taxpayer under Section
 152.1.064 or
152.1.065 of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or conditions of

TITLE NINE - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.
171.01   Schedule of fines and court costs.
171.02   Payment of citations.
171.03   Failure to pay complete sentence or appear before court.
171.04   Clerk of Court.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

unless the same is in a completely enclosed building or garage. The 72 hours
shall begin on the date and time the person has been notified in writing,
either in person or by posting a notice on the vehicle, by the Building
Commissioner or his or her agent, that such vehicle is being stored in
violation.
   (b)   The Building Commissioner, or his or her agent, shall serve notice, by
certified mail with return receipt requested, personal delivery, or by posting
such notice upon a conspicuous location at the property, to the person having
right to the possession of the property on which an unlicensed or disabled
vehicle or vehicle parts are stored, stating that within 72 hours of receipt of
the notice, the vehicle or vehicle parts shall either by placed in an enclosed
building or garage, or removed from the property.
   (c)   No person shall leave an unlicensed or disabled vehicle or farm
machinery or vehicle parts as defined in subsection (a) hereof for a period
longer than 72 hours after receipt of a notice as provided in subsection (b)
hereof. The fact that the vehicle or vehicle parts are so left is prima facie
evidence of wilful failure to comply with this notice, and each subsequent
period of 24 hours of non-compliance constitutes a separate offense.

violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not

offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars

the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long

court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.

E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:

the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the

community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the

court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or

should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.

333.012 ARRESTEE FOR OVI OR HAVING PHYSICAL CONTROL WHILE UNDER INFLUENCE TO
RECEIVE WRITTEN AND VERBAL ADVICE; SUBMISSION OR REFUSAL TO SUBMIT TO TEST OR
TESTS; LICENSE SUSPENSION OR SEIZURE; OFFICER'S SWORN REPORT.
   (a)   The arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this section to any person under arrest for a violation of Section
333.01(a) or (b),
333.014, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 4511.19, 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance. The officer shall
give that advice in a written form that contains the information described in
subsection (b) hereof and shall read the advice to the person. The form shall
contain a statement that the form was shown to the person under arrest and read
to the person by the arresting officer. one or more persons shall witness the
arresting officer's reading of the form, and the witnesses shall certify to
this fact by signing the form. The person must submit to the chemical test or
tests, subsequent to the request of the arresting officer, within two hours of
the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does not submit to the
test or tests within that two-hour time limit, the failure to submit
automatically constitutes a refusal to submit to the test or tests.
   (b)    If a person is under arrest as described in subsection (a) hereof,
before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test or tests to
determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer shall read the
following form to the person:
   "You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior of OVI, OVUAC, or operating
a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a
listed metabolite of a controlled substance conviction under state or municipal
law within the preceding twenty years, you now are under arrest for OVI, and,
if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the OVI.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law,
your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have
to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense."
   (c)    If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person under
arrest as described in subsection (a) hereof to submit to a chemical test or
tests under Section
333.011 and Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio or
out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within twenty-four hours after the arrest, and, upon the
surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the
license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's
initial appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
   (d)    (1)    If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in subsection (a) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under Section
333.011 and Ohio R.C. 4511.191, if the officer advises the person in accordance
with this section of the consequences of the person's refusal or submission,
and if either the person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the
arrest was for a violation of Section
333.014 and Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the test results
indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a
metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, the arresting
officer shall do all of the following:
         A.   On behalf of the registrar of motor vehicles, notify the person
that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension will last at
least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which will be held
within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the issuance of a
citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the suspension at the
initial appearance or during the period of time ending thirty days after that
initial appearance;
         B.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within twenty-four hours after the
person is given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the
officer's employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to
the registrar.
         C.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the registrar of the change;
         D.   1.   Send to the registrar, within forty-eight hours after the
arrest of the person, a sworn report that includes all of the following
statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in

ordinance or for being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation
of Section
333.014  and Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Section

equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   That the officer asked the person to take the designated
chemical test or tests, advised the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and
gave the person the form described in subsection (b) of this section;
               d.   That either the person refused to submit to the chemical
test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a violation of Section
333.014 and Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the test
results indicated a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
            2.   Subsection D.1. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of Section
333.014 and Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical
test or tests under Section
333.011 and Ohio R.C. 4511.191, and who submits to the test or tests,
regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of
a controlled substance that the test results indicate is present in the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
   (e)   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that is
completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
or the registrar of motor vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than fourteen days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than forty-
eight hours after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a
copy of the sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear
on the charge for which the person was arrested.
   (f)   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this section
is prima-facie proof of the information and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as prima-facie proof of the information and
statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C. 4511.197 relative to
any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the
report.

   (b)   It is prima-facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or
established pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.21 by the Ohio Director of
Transportation or Council, for the operator of a motor vehicle to operate the

      (1)   A.   Consistent with Ohio R.C. 4511.21(B)(2), and consistent with
the general parameters of Ohio R.C. 4511.21(B), Council does hereby establish a
uniform speed limit throughout the Village of Golf Manor at twenty-five (25)
miles per hour. The only exception to this shall be a lower speed limit within
designated school districts as required by law.
         B.   Upon enactment of this section, appropriate signs shall be
erected throughout the Village establishing and confirming this speed limit.

line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by subsection (b)(4) hereof and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by
            subsection (b)(7) hereof. The end of every school zone may be
      marked by a sign indicating the end of the zone. Nothing in this section
or in the manual and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control
devices shall be construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs
equipped with flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the
hours in which the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;
            2.    Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed
with the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce in compliance with O.A.C. §
3301-35-08, a copy of the school’s report for the parents of the school’s
pupils certifying that the school meets state minimum standards for
nonchartered, nontax-supported schools and presents evidence of this filing to
the jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment of a school
zone;
            3.    Any special elementary school that in writing requests the
County Engineer to create a school zone at the location of the school. Upon
receipt of such written request, the County Engineer shall create a school zone
at that location by erecting appropriate signs;

of that program. Upon receipt of such a written request, the County Engineer
shall create a school zone at that location by erecting the appropriate signs.
         C.   As used in this section, "school zone" means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is

jurisdiction, the Ohio Director of Transportation may extend the traditional
school zone boundaries. The distances in subsections (b)(1)C.1. to 3. hereof
shall not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction and are bounded by
whichever of the following distances or combinations thereof the Director
approves as most appropriate:
            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building
lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of highway;
         Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
Director's initial action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at
the traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property
lines, except when those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)
(1)A. and C. hereof.
         D.   As used in this subsection, "crosswalk" has the meaning given
that term in Section
301.09. The Director may, upon request by resolution of Council, and upon
submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic and other
information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
on each approach direction of the State route;
   (c)   It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed any of the speed
limitations in subsection (b) hereof, or any declared or established pursuant
to this section by the Director or local authorities.
 
   (d)   In every charge of violation of this section the affidavit and warrant
shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time and place
of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person is alleged
to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to bring the
vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the affidavit and
warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is alleged to have
driven.
   (e)   Whenever, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or this section, the
speed limitations as established herein have been altered, either higher or
lower, and the appropriate signs giving notice have been erected as required,
operators of motor vehicles shall be governed by the speed limitations set
forth on such signs. It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed the
speed limits posted upon such signs.
   (f)   (1)   A violation of any provision of this section is one of the
following:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (j)(1)B., (1)C., (2)
and (3) of this section, a minor misdemeanor;
         B.   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of any provision of this
section or of any provision of Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or a municipal ordinance that
is substantially similar to any provision of this section, a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree;
         C.   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of any
provision of this section or of any provision of Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or a
municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to any provision of this
section, a misdemeanor of the third degree.
      (2)   Notwithstanding subsection (j)(1) of this section, if the offender
operated a motor vehicle in a construction zone where a sign was then posted in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.98, the court, in addition to all other
penalties provided by law, shall impose upon the offender a fine of two times
the usual amount imposed for the violation. No court shall impose a fine of two
times the usual amount imposed for the violation upon an offender if the
offender alleges, in an affidavit filed with the court prior to the offender’s
sentencing, that the offender is indigent and is unable to pay the fine imposed
pursuant to this subsection and if the court determines that the offender is an
indigent person and unable to pay the fine.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
 303.991 of the Traffic Code.

      (1)   If the driver of the motor vehicle is traveling on a street or
highway that consists of at least two lanes that carry traffic in the same
direction of travel as that of the driver’s motor vehicle, the driver shall

and traffic conditions, shall change lanes into a lane that is not adjacent to
that of the stationary public safety vehicle, emergency vehicle, road service
vehicle, waste collection vehicle, vehicle used by the Public Utilities
Commission to conduct motor vehicle inspections in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4923.04 and 4923.06 or a highway maintenance vehicle.

described in subsection (a)(1) of this section, or if the driver is traveling
on a highway of that type but it is not possible to change lanes or if to do so
would be unsafe, the driver shall proceed with due caution, reduce the speed of
the motor vehicle, and maintain a safe speed for the road, weather and traffic
conditions.
   (b)   This section does not relieve the driver of a public safety vehicle,
emergency vehicle, road service vehicle, waste collection vehicle, vehicle used
by the Public Utilities Commission to conduct motor vehicle inspections in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4923.04 and 4923.06, or a highway maintenance vehicle

offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Section
303.99(b), upon a finding that a person operated a motor vehicle in violation
of subsection (c) of this section, the court, in addition to all other
penalties provided by law, shall impose a fine of two times the usual amount
imposed for the violation.
      (3)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
 303.991 of the Traffic Code.
   (e)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

may be towed or otherwise removed from the parking location by the law
enforcement agency of the municipality. A motor vehicle that is so towed or
removed shall not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of
ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the

parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with subsection
(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed

   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license

case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5,000.00
Second degree                                 4,000.00
Third degree                                  3,000.00
Fourth degree                                 2,000.00
Minor                                         1,000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2,000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1,000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.

   (a)   Notwithstanding other provisions in the Village Code of Ordinances,
chickens may be kept within the Village in the R-A Residential Single Family
District and R-B Multi-Family District, subject to the following rules and
conditions.
   (b)   For purposes of this section, chickens are not deemed to be "farm
animals" as defined in the Village Code of Ordinances so long as said chickens
are kept, raised, or used in any manner related to a personal or household use,
such as for personal consumption, education, or to maintain such animals as
pets. Chickens may not be kept, raised or used for commercial purposes,
including but not limited to the sale of chickens or eggs or to convey the same
for profit, in which case such chickens are deemed to be "farm animals" as
defined in this Code.
   (c)   Restrictions.
      (1)    Each household in the R-A Residential Single Family District may
keep up to six (6) chickens on the premises at any one time. If two (2) or more
residents in the R-B Multi-Family District share a common chicken habitat or
coop on one property, up to twelve (12) chickens may be kept on the multi-
family premises.
      (2)    Only female chickens, a/k/a hens, may be kept in the Village.
Males, a/k/a roosters, are not allowed at any time.
      (3)    No chickens may be slaughtered on any residential property in the
Village.
      (4)    Chicken feed must be kept in a rodent- and predator-proof
container.
   (d)   Habitat.
      (1)    Chickens may only be maintained outdoors in a predator-proof
chicken house, coop, or other structure that is thoroughly ventilated, of
sufficient size to permit free movement of the animals, designated to be easily
accessed, cleaned, and maintained by the owner, and at least two (2) square
feet in size for each chicken.
      (2)    All such structures are herein defined as "habitat" or "habitat
structure" and shall be considered as accessory structures as defined elsewhere
in this Code. A zoning permit is required for this and all other accessory
structures. All such structures shall comply with the provisions set forth in
Sections
 1129.03 and
 1131.03 of the Codified Ordinances, including but not limited to six (6) foot
setback from adjoining property lines.
      (3)    In addition to the other conditions and restrictions applicable to
accessory structures, at least fifty percent (50%) of any structure housing
chickens must be appropriately screened from the street and abutting properties
by either a fence, wall, or landscaping as permitted in the Village to provide
reasonable and appropriate cover to reduce, lessen, or obscure the visual
impact of the structure. Such screening shall be evenly spaced around the
structure as appropriate.
      (4)    Chickens shall be enclosed within the habitat structure at night
from sunset to sunrise. If chickens are allowed by the owner to be outside of
the structure from sunrise to sunset, the chickens must be contained within an
area that is fenced or surrounded by other barriers ("containment area") so as
to prevent access to the chickens by dogs or other predators, and to prevent
chickens from travelling outside of the containment area.
      (5)    All areas in and around the chicken habitat structure must be
maintained in a clean, safe, sanitary and orderly manner for the health and
welfare of the chickens as well as all other animals and persons. No part of
the structure or surrounding area shall constitute a nuisance. No person shall
allow the chickens or the habitat to be a nuisance, including but not limited
to allowing noxious odors or any noise of a loud or persistent and habitual
nature.
   (e)   Permits.
      (1)    No person shall keep a chicken on property within the Village
without a permit issued by the Village. There is no fee for the permit. The
Village Administrator has the authority to consider all such permit
applications as well as revocations of any such permit. Applications for a
permit shall be made in writing and submitted to the Administrator. A decision
on a permit application shall be made by the Administrator within fifteen (15)
business days of receipt, excluding weekends and holidays. If a permit
application is denied, or if a permit is revoked, the property owner may appeal
the Administrator's decision to the Planning Commission within seven (7)
business days of the date the Administrator's written decision is issued. The
Administrator may, at his or her sole discretion, provide an extension of time
for good cause to any person filing an appeal. If a permit is revoked, the
property owner may continue to maintain chickens on the subject property
pending an appeal and decision by the Planning Commission unless the revocation
is due, in whole or in part, to a nuisance, in which event such nuisance must
be remedied as directed by the Administrator whether or not the revocation is
appealed.
      (2)    Any person submitting an application for a permit under this
section shall consent to an inspection by the Village of the property where the
chicken(s) will be kept.
      (3)    If the Administrator becomes aware of a possible violation of this
section on property subject to a permit under this section, the Administrator
shall be permitted to inspect the property at any reasonable time after written
notice to the occupants of the subject property to determine whether or not a
violation exists. If the Administrator determines that a violation of the
Village Code of Ordinances exists, the property owner shall be notified to
bring the property into compliance within a reasonable amount of time as
determined by the Administrator. If the property is not brought into compliance
within the time to remedy a violation, the permit shall be automatically
revoked.
   (f)   The Village Administrator may designate any employee or agent of the
Village to perform any of the duties of the Administrator, or exercise the
authority of the Administrator, as prescribed by this section.
   (g)   Penalty. Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor. Each day the violation exists constitutes a separate violation.

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

557.08 EVICTION OR RETALIATION PROHIBITED.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful for a landlord to terminate the Lease Agreement
or periodic tenancy of any tenant without good cause or otherwise retaliate
against any tenant because that tenant complained to the police or other
Village official or employee about nuisance or criminal activities on the
landlord's premises or made calls for service to the police related to nuisance
or criminal activities on the landlord's premises. It shall be unlawful for a
landlord or any person acting as an agent for the landlord to intimidate or
actively discourage a tenant and/or persons associated with a tenant from
calling the police to report nuisance activity associated with a property. It
shall be presumed that any attempt to increase charges, reduce services, or to
otherwise harass or retaliate against the tenant during the twelve (12)-month
period following receipt of the complaint by the Chief of Police constitutes
unlawful retaliation under this section.
   (b)   Such presumption shall be rebutted by the preponderance of evidence
that the actions taken by the landlord were based upon good cause. "Good cause"
as used in this subsection means that a landlord must show good cause for his
or her actions, other than one related to or caused by the operation of this
section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tenant's Lease Agreement or periodic
tenancy may be terminated for a failure to pay rent; committing nuisance
activity as defined herein; committing waste upon the premises; violating the
terms and conditions of the Lease Agreement or periodic tenancy; or as
otherwise provided in O.R.C. 5321. A landlord's failure to renew a Lease
Agreement or periodic tenancy upon expiration of such Lease Agreement or
periodic tenancy shall not be deemed a violation of this subsection.

557.09 COST FOR ENFORCEMENT.
   From time to time, the Police Chief shall review the Village budget to
determine the cost for enforcement to be billed as provided herein to the
premises owner. Such cost shall be allocated as a per officer/per hour basis
considering wage costs, including benefits, and Department overhead. This cost
shall be reported to Council, which by motion shall establish the current costs
to be billed for the succeeding twelve (12) months. With the enactment of this
chapter, the cost has been determined to be fifty dollars ($50.00) per hour per
officer called to the scene of nuisance activities as defined herein.
(Ord. 2019-8. Passed 6-24-19.)

   The provisions of any part of this Chapter are severable. If any provision
or subsection hereof or the application thereof to any person or circumstances
is held invalid, the other provisions, subsection, and applications of such
chapter to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. It is
declared to be the intent of this section that the same would have been adopted
had such invalid provisions, if any, not been included herein.

the testimony is not taken before the Commission, the record shall be
transmitted to the Commission.
      (9)   In a proceeding under this chapter, the production of a written,

a written inquiry, or record, or other document purporting to have been made by
a person shall be prima facie evidence that it was authorized by the person.

      (1)   State/Federal Remedies.
         A.   The remedies provided for in this chapter are in addition to, not

therefore not be construed so as to limit a person's right to file complaint
with any state or federal agency, board, tribunal or court vested with
jurisdiction to receive, review and act upon complaints of discrimination This
chapter shall not be construed as limiting the right of any person to seek
remedies in courts of competent jurisdiction pursuant to state or federal law
which grant private
rights of action to persons aggrieved by discriminatory acts of the type
prohibited by this chapter. There is no requirement that an aggrieved person
file a complaint with the Village pursuant to this chapter before seeking any
other federal, state or other remedy available to the person.
         B.   A person's election to seek remedies provided for in this chapter
shall not operate to toll any statute of limitation set forth in state or

discrimination of the type prohibited by this chapter.
            (Ord. 2019-10. Passed 1-27-19.)
      (2)   Commission Remedies.
         A.   The Commission may order a civil fine of up to five hundred
dollars ($500.00) for each violation. Each day on which a continuing violation
occurs shall constitute a new and separate violation of this chapter. Provided,
however, the maximum collected fine for a continuing violation shall be two
thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500). Fines collected pursuant to this
section will be used to establish a fund to educate the community about
nondiscrimination practices and to promote nondiscrimination in the Village.
The Village Solicitor is authorized to pursue enforcement and collection of
such fines in a separate civil action. In addition to recovery of such fines in
any subsequent court proceeding, the Respondent/Defendant shall be liable for
all costs of collection including reasonable Attorney fees.
            (Ord. 2021-11. Passed 11-22-21.)
         B.   The Commission may publish, or cause to be published, the names
of persons who have been determined to have engaged in a discriminatory
practice.

the Commission, including an order dismissing a complaint or stating the terms
of a conciliation agreement, may obtain judicial review in accordance with
applicable law.

and purposes. If any provision of this chapter is held invalid or
unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or
unconstitutionality shall not affect or invalidate the other provisions hereof,
all of which are declared and shall be construed to be separate and severable.

court of law or equity and shall not prevent any person from exercising any
right or seeking any remedy otherwise entitled to under any other law,

traffic warnings including reflectors and/or traffic cones to manage any public
safety concerns, may require such Units to be placed upon boards or other
movable items to preserve the public street and sidewalk, and may impose such
other reasonable restrictions as may be necessary for public safety. The
Village Administrator also may require an appropriate security bond to be
posted with the Village to preserve and protect the public sidewalk and public
street against any damage. Applicants who do damage the street shall be
responsible to restore the damaged pavement to the satisfaction of the Village

   (c)   When either or both the total suspended solids and B.O.D. of a water
or waste accepted for admission to the City sewage works exceeds the values of
these constituents for normal sewage, the excess concentration in either or
both, as the case may be, shall be evaluated volumetrically in terms of normal
sewage and be subject to surcharge on the volume derived in accordance with the
following formula:
 
Sv = (Sw-2500) x 0.65 x F x 133,690 + (Bw-2000) x 0.65 x F x 133,690
      2500                         2000
which reduced to its simplest form is:
 
Sv = F ((Sw-2500) 35 + (Bw-2000) 43).
where Sv is the derived volume of wastes in cubic feet subject to surcharge.
   Sw - the pounds per million gallons of suspended solids in the wastes as
discharged.
   2,500 - the pounds per million gallons of suspended solids in the normal
sewage.
   Bw - the pounds per million gallons of B.O.D. in the wastes as discharged.
   2,000 - the pounds per million gallons of B.O.D. in normal sewage.
   0.65 - Factor allowance for 65 percent degree of purification.
   Present B.O.D. requirement for Cincinnati Pool established by Ohio River
Valley Water Sanitation Commission.
   F - the flow expressed in million gallons of the wastes as discharged.
   133,690 - Factor to convert million gallons to cubic feet.
   (d)   The equivalent volume of normal sewage as derived from the excess
above the normal strength of any water and wastes shall be subject to a
surcharge for the volume of equivalent normal sewage as computed from the
formula, at a flat rate of three cents (3¢) for each 100 cubic feet, as above
computed.
(Ord. 6-1953. Passed 4-27-53.)
911.04 ADMISSIBLE SEWAGE.
   No sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquid shall be discharged into
the public sewer system other than those admissible to the Cincinnati Public
Sewer System under the ordinances of the City of Cincinnati and the rules and
regulations of the City Manager of the City of Cincinnati, promulgated pursuant
thereto, as are now or may hereafter be in effect.
(Ord. 6-1953. Passed 4-27-53.)
911.05 INDUSTRY PROVIDING OWN SEWAGE TREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Where an industry otherwise producing or now discharging any sewage or waste
into a stream or otherwise disposing of such sewage or waste contrary to law,
contemplates providing its own proper facilities for the treatment of this
sewage or waste instead of utilizing the Metropolitan Sewage Disposal System,
such industry or producer can, by special agreement with the City of
Cincinnati, entered into within six months after the effective date of
Ordinance No. 25- 1953, of the City of Cincinnati bind itself to construct its
own proper facilities for the treatment of its sewage and wastes within twelve

treatment facilities within the prescribed time, it shall be entitled to a
refund of any sewerage service charges or surcharges paid by it.
(Ord. 6-1953. Passed 4-27-53.)
911.06 INDUSTRY PROVIDING OWN SEWAGE PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   Where an industry now or hereafter discharging any waste into a sewer
connected to the Public Sewer System, contemplates providing facilities for
pretreatment of such wastes so as to reduce the strength of waste, the industry
can, by special agreement with the City of Cincinnati, entered into within six
months after the effective date of Ordinance No. 25-1953, of the City of
Cincinnati, bind itself to construct such pretreatment facilities within twelve
months after the effective date the sewerage surcharge made pursuant to the
Ordinance. If any industry provides satisfactory pretreatment within the
prescribed time, it shall be entitled to a refund in an amount equal to the
difference between the surcharge actually paid and the surcharge that would
have been paid had such pretreatment facilities been in operation on the date
that the sewerage surcharge went into effect.
(Ord. 6-1953. Passed 4-27-53.)
911.07 REMEDY FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.
   Where the sewerage service charge or surcharge established herein is not
paid, or sewage industrial waste, water or other liquids are discharged into
the public sewer system in violation of this chapter, the City shall have the
right to shut off such water supply, or to remove or close sewer connections,
or both, until payment is made or the provisions of this chapter are complied
with.
(Ord. 6-1953. Passed 4-27-53.)

replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing provided that the
cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety upon order of
such official, unless the strengthening or restoration involves an expenditure
equal to or greater than sixty percent (60%) of the buildings assessed value,

1138.01  ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE.
   The I-A1(O) Industrial Overlay District, hereinafter referred to as
"Industrial Overlay " is hereby established to promote strong industrial
districts and preserve the character of adjoining land uses for the purpose of
promoting improvement of the quality of life, removal of blighting influences
and the avoidance of blight, maintenance of property values, prevention of
piecemeal development, and the encouragement of good design practices. The
purpose of the Industrial Overlay is to establish a site plan review process
within the Industrial Overlay area to protect the Industrial Overlay area from
blighting influences caused by insensitive and incompatible land development.
(Ord. 2002-3. Passed 4-22-02.)
1138.02  INITIATION OF OVERLAY PROCESS.
   Any property owner or group of property owners may make application to the
Planning Commission for an I-A1 (O) Industrial Overlay District. The Commission
or Council may instruct the Planning staff to develop an I-A1 (O) Industrial
Overlay District for any area which either body determines meets the criteria
for such an overlay.
(Ord. 2002-3. Passed 4-22-02.)
1138.03 APPROVAL OF AN I-A1(O) INDUSTRIAL OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   An I-A1 (O) Industrial Overlay District shall be considered by the Planning
Commission and Council in the same manner and follow the same procedures for
consideration of a zone change as set forth in Sections
1143.11 to
1143.24. Each property or group of properties approved by Council as I-A1 (O)
Industrial Overlay District shall continue to be governed by the underlying
zoning district regulations except to the extent that they are modified by the
approved I-A1 (O) Industrial Overlay District text. (Ord. 2002-3. Passed 4-22-
02.)
1138.04 CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL OF AN I-A1(O) INDUSTRIAL OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   Areas to which an I-A1 (O) Industrial Overlay District may be applied shall
be in one of the following categories:
   (a)    The area adjoins an arterial street as designated by the Village;
   (b)    The area adjoins or is across the street from an existing R-
A Residential, R-B Residential, B-A Business or B-A(O) Business Overlay zoned
property;
   (c)    The area can be shown to have one of the following characteristics:
      (l)    The area is one of high infrastructure cost where past, present or
planned investment in drainage facilities, streets and utilities, is higher
than the average infrastructure costs throughout the Village;
      (2)    A concentration of light industrial oriented establishments
serving as an industrial activity center within the community; or
      (3)    Areas where blighting influences are identified, blighting
influences being any current use of land which if allowed to remain unmodified
will forseeably evolve into blight or will encourage blight to arise in other
areas.
         (Ord. 2002-3. Passed 4-22-02.)
1138.05 APPLICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL IN AN I-A1 (O) INDUSTRIAL OVERLAY
DISTRICT.
   No building or other structure shall be erected, moved, enlarged,
structurally altered, nor shall any building be established or changed in use
without obtaining approval pursuant to this chapter. The application for
approval shall include the following:

structural plans and specifications prior to obtaining development permission
approval.
(Ord. 2002-3. Passed 4-22-02.)
1138.06 DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS.
   When an application has been filed for an approval, the Planning Commission
shall conduct a review of the application to determine if the development
proposal is consistent with the guidelines contained in Section
1138.07, using the same review process as is contained in Sections
1143.40 to

(Ord. 2002-3. Passed 4-22-02.)
1138.07 DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES.
   The Planning Commission shall consider the following guidelines in
determining whether the approval of a request for development approval pursuant

   (a)    The granting of such requests would not be materially detrimental or
injurious to property in the district or vicinity.
   (b)    All development and parking expansion for activities should occur
within the designated industrial district.

remodeled buildings and the space between and around buildings should be
consistent with the character of the area and be in harmony with neighboring
buildings.

heights of neighboring buildings.
   (f)   Mechanical equipment, including air conditioning, piping, ducts, and
conduits, external to the building should be concealed from view from adjacent
buildings or street level by grills, screens, or other enclosures.
   (g)    Existing small, underutilized lots should be combined to create
larger and/or efficient parking areas.
   (h)    Existing parking lots should be expanded rather than introducing
additional, separate parking areas.

fences to provide an effective buffer for any adjacent residential or
commercial properties and public street right-of-ways.
   (j)   All parking areas should be paved and marked. Within the interior of
the parking areas, there should be landscaping to break up large areas of
parking.

times and such loading and unloading operations must adhere to Section
509.09, Noise Control, of the Code.
   (q)   All loading and service areas fronting Losantiville or Wiehe Road
shall be adequately screened from the street right-of-way. Screening is not
required along any lot line fronting another adjacent industrial use.
      (Ord. 2018-10. Passed 8-13-18.)
1138.08  ISSUANCE OF PERMITS.
   If approval is granted, the applicant shall obtain whatever permits are
necessary to proceed with the development from the appropriate department of
the Village prior to undertaking the requested improvements. If the applicant
fails to make application for a building permit within one year from the
approval decision, the applicant's rights under the terms of approval shall

1139.01 ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE.
   The Business “A” Overlay District, hereinafter referred to as "Overlay" is
hereby established to promote strong business districts and preserve the
character of adjoining land uses for the purpose of promoting improvement of
the quality of life, removal of blighting influences and the avoidance of
blight, maintenance of property values, prevention of piecemeal development,
and the discouragement of strip commercial development. The purpose of the
Overlay is to establish a site plan review process within the Overlay area to
protect the Overlay area from blighting influences caused by insensitive and
incompatible land development.
(Ord. 92-20. Passed 11-23-92.)
1139.02 INITIATION OF OVERLAY PROCESS.
   Any property owner or group of property owners may make application to the
Planning Commission for a Business “A” District Overlay. The Commission or
Council may instruct the Planning staff to develop a Business “A” District
Overlay for any area which either body determines meets the criteria for such
an overlay.
(Ord. 92-20. Passed 11-23-92.)
1139.03 APPROVAL OF A BUSINESS “A” DISTRICT OVERLAY.
   A Business “A” District Overlay shall be considered by the Planning
Commission and Council in the same manner and follow the same procedures for
consideration of a zone change as set forth in Sections
1143.11 to
1143.24. Each property or group of properties approved by Council as a Business
“A” District Overlay shall continue to be governed by the underlying zoning
district regulations except to the extent that they are modified by the
approved Business “A” District Overlay text.
(Ord. 92-20. Passed 11-23-92.)
1139.04 CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL OF A BUSINESS “A” DISTRICT OVERLAY.

conduits, external to the building should be concealed from view from adjacent
buildings or street level by grills, screens, or other enclosures.
   (g)   Existing small, underutilized lots should be combined to create larger
and more efficient parking areas.

1143.28 VARIANCES.
   The Planning Commission may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such
variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the
public interest where, owning to special conditions of the property, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance would result in
unnecessary hardship. No variance shall be granted by the Board unless it is
found that all of the requirements and standards contained in Section
1143.30 are met. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or
buildings in the same district and no permitted or nonconforming uses of land,
structures or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for
issuance of a variance.
(Ord. 92-20. Passed 11-23-92.)
1143.29 APPLICATION FOR VARIANCE.
   A variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be granted by
the Planning Commission unless and until a written application for a variance
is submitted to the Zoning Administrator. The application shall be signed by
the owner or applicant attesting to the truth and exactness of all information
supplied by the application. At a minimum, the application shall contain the
following information:
   (a)   Name, address and telephone number of applicant;
   (b)   A survey by a registered civil engineer shall be required when a
requested variance is a variance from the set-back requirements, a change or
addition to the existing exterior of a structure, or the location of a fence or
other structure upon the property. Such survey shall set forth the location of
the existing structure or structures upon such property and the proposed
location of any change, modification or other structure which is the subject of
the variance request. The Service Director is authorized to waive any or all
parts of this requirement if the applicant provides such additional
documentation or information to the Director to satisfy the Director that
equivalent information is being provided to the Planning Commission to
appropriately consider the variance. The Planning Commission, however, as a
condition to granting such variance or as a condition to final consideration of
the variance, may, by a majority vote of those members present and voting,
require this additional information although previously waived by the Director.
   (c)   Description of the nature of variance requested;
   (d)   A statement demonstrating that the requested variance conforms to the
standards set forth in Section
1143.30; and
   (e)   A fee as established by Council.

1143.30 STANDARDS FOR VARIANCE.
   A variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be granted by
the Planning Commission unless it makes specific findings that all of the
following standards are met:
   (a)   The granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of the regulations imposed by this Zoning Ordinance on the
district in which it is located, and shall not be injurious to the area or
otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
   (b)   The granting of the variance shall not permit the establishment of any
use which is not otherwise permitted in the district.
   (c)   There shall exist special circumstances or conditions, fully described
in the findings, applicable to the land or buildings for which the variance is
sought, which are peculiar to such land or buildings and do not apply generally
to land or buildings in the area, and which are such that the strict
application of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building. Mere loss in value
shall not justify a variance; there shall be deprivation of beneficial use of
land.
   (d)   There shall be proof of hardship created by the strict application of
this Zoning Ordinance. It is not sufficient proof of hardship to show that
greater profit would result if the variance were granted. Furthermore, the
hardship complained of cannot be self-created; nor can it be established on
this basis by one who purchases with or without knowledge of the restrictions;
it shall result from the application of this Zoning Ordinance; it shall be
suffered directly by the property in question.
   (e)   The granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of
the land or building and the variance as granted is the minimum variance that
will accomplish this purpose.
   (f)   The proposed variance shall not impair an adequate supply of light and
air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the public
streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or
substantially diminish or impair property values of the adjacent area.
      (Ord. 92-20. Passed 11-23-92.)
1143.31 SUPPLEMENTARY CONDITIONS AND SAFEGUARDS.
   In granting any appeal or variance the Planning Commission may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Ordinance.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards when made a part of the terms under
which the appeal or variance is granted shall be deemed a violation of this
Code and punishable under Section
1145.99. Under no circumstances shall the Board grant an appeal or variance to
allow a use not permissible under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance in the
district involved, or any use prohibited by the terms of this Code in such
district.
(Ord. 92-20. Passed 11-23-93.)

1143.32 the Planning Commission shall either approve, approve with
supplementary conditions as specified in Section
1143.31, or disapprove the request for appeal or variance. The Board shall
further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify
the granting of the appeal or variance and by demonstrating that the decision

the Court of Common Pleas.

1146.11   Appeal of decision on modifications.
 
1146.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development ("PUD") Regulations is to
encourage and allow more creative and efficient design of land developments
than is possible under subdivision and district zoning requirements. The PUD
Overlay District is intended to allow substantial flexibility in planning and
design. This flexibility often accrues in the form of relief from compliance
with conventional subdivision regulations and zoning ordinance site and design
requirements. This flexibility should result in a development that is more
compatible and harmonious with the natural environment, surrounding land uses,
and the goals, objectives, and policies of the community. An intrinsic premise
upon which approval of a PUD plan is conditioned is that while greater density
or more lenient siting requirements may be granted, the PUD should contain
features not normally required of traditional developments.
(Ord. 2006-5. Passed 7-10-06.)
1146.02 DISTRICT DESIGNATION AND APPLICABILITY.
   The PUD District is an overlay of alternative regulations, including
procedures and standards that are applicable to all land within the
jurisdiction of these regulations in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. The PUD Overlay District shall be established on the official zoning
map following the zoning amendment process outlined in the Zoning Ordinance.
This overlay district will enable individual property owners to request
approval on their property in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
Each PUD District shall be delineated on the zoning map with a specific
reference number identifying each separate district.
(Ord. 2006-5. Passed 7-10-06.)
1146.03 PERMITTED USES.
   The uses permitted in a planned unit development overlay must be either
permitted by right or conditionally permitted in the underlying zoning
district. office and commercial uses may be permitted in a residential district
only as an accessory use intended to provide services to meet the needs of the
PUD residents. In these instances, office and commercial use are restricted to
five percent (5%) of the gross square footage of the entire PUD and the area
(building footprint and outdoor use) shall not be more than three percent (3%)
of the gross land area of the PUD.
(Ord. 2006-5. Passed 7-10-06.)
1146.04 GENERAL STANDARDS AND CONDITIONS.
   Applications for Planned Unit Developments must meet the following minimum
standards:
   (a)   The minimum land area for a PUD is two acres.
   (b)   The site area of the proposed PUD must be under single ownership and/
or unified control.
   (c)   The PUD must be generally consistent with the Village of Golf Manor
Comprehensive Plan, as stated in Section
1121.01 of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)   Project perimeter setbacks must be equal to or greater than the
setbacks required in underlying zoning district, including buffer requirements.
      (Ord. 2006-5. Passed 7-10-06.)
1146.05 REVIEW CRITERIA.
   In order to receive approval of a Planned Unit Development Overlay
designation, the applicant must demonstrate that the following principles are
met:
   (a)   Compatibility with Surrounding Land Uses: The proposed uses in the
Planned Unit Development are consistent with the current or proposed underlying
zoning and are compatible with the uses on abutting properties and the area in
general. The uses must be of a type and so located as to cause no undue
detrimental impact on surrounding properties.
   (b)   Density: The residential density of the Planned Unit Development
should not exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the residential density
requirements of the underlying district. Any increase in density should be
related to a corresponding increase in the amount of open space provided, and
should not result in a significant increase in impervious surface coverage from
what would normally be expected under standard zoning.
   (c)   Open Space: The Planned Unit Development shall provide for the
reservation, within the tract to be developed, of a significant amount of land
area as common public open space. This may include such areas as pedestrian
corridors between different uses, public gathering places, park land, or
sensitive environmental areas. This common open space shall be conveyed to a
legally established property owner association or trust, unless it is
determined by the Village that it should be publicly dedicated. The area shall
be in such a composition and configuration as to be desirable as a gathering
space or passage way, and should not consist of isolated or fragmented pieces
of land that provide no public use or benefit. In general, PUD site plans
should demonstrate a minimum of twenty percent (20%) of gross land area as open
space, exclusive of private streets, parking areas, sidewalks that are an
integral part of a specific use, or the required perimeter setbacks. Not more
than fifty percent (50%) of the open space may be designated for storm water
detention or retention basins.
(Ord. 2006-5. Passed 7-10-06.)
1146.06 APPLICATION REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS.
   (a)    Pre-application Process: Prior to preparing or submitting a complete
application for a PUD overlay approval, an applicant should meet with the
Zoning Administrator or other administering official to present the concept of
the proposed development and to discuss the procedures and standards for
development plan approval. The intent of this conference is to facilitate the
filing and consideration of an innovative development plan and complete
application and to outline for the applicant the review process and general PUD
standards. No representation made by the Zoning Administrator during such
conference or at any other time shall be binding upon the Village with respect
to the application subsequently submitted.
   (b)    PUD Application and General Development Plan Submittal: An applicant
for a PUD overlay shall file an application on a form or forms provided by the
Village. The application shall include, as appropriate, all of the information
required for a zoning amendment identified in Section
1143.14  plus the following additional information, all of which will be
considered applicant's "General Development Plan":

association or trust should be identified and the proposed covenants outlined.
      (4)   Identification of what rights of way are to be dedicated and if
private streets or alleys are proposed.
      (5)   A summary table outlining what other variances from subdivision and
zoning regulations are being requested (i.e.: building height, lot width,
setbacks, sidewalk or road construction standards, etc.)
      (6)   Evidence of legal control of the property to be designated for the
PUD.
      (7)   The proposed schedule of site development, construction of
structures and associated facilities. If the PUD is a large tract of land that
will be developed in multiple sections, the proposed schedule should reflect
the anticipated timing for submittal of final development plans for each
section.
      (8)   Proposed general lighting plan for streets, parking areas and
outside activity and/or storage areas.
      (9)   Preliminary landscape plan, with particular emphasis on perimeter
buffer landscaping, park and open space landscaping, and parking area
landscaping.
      (10)   Preliminary storm water detention plan as part of a finish grading
plan.
      (11)   PUD application fee as established by Council.

development can be substantially completed within the period of time specified
in the schedule submitted by the applicant.
      (6)   Proposed modifications of the standard regulations of the
subdivision or zoning code are warranted by the innovative design of the
development plan and are not simply for the convenience or economic benefit of
the applicant.
      (7)   Proposed modification of any subdivision or zoning regulation has
been compensated for by an increase in other site amenities that exceed the
minimum requirements established for standard developments.
      (8)   Adequate provision has been made for the ownership and on-going

Commission and shall act on the application in accordance with the requirements
of Chapter
1143 for zoning amendments.
   (h)    Effect of Council PUD Application and General Plan Approval.
      (1)   The approval of a PUD application represents approval of a change
in the zoning map of the City of Golf Manor. Thirty days following the approval
by Council of a PUD application, the Village shall cause the zoning map to be
amended to represent the PUD approval and provide a designation and number on
the zoning map for the PUD. The general development plan is adopted as part of
the zoning amendment and becomes part of the ordinance adopting the PUD.
      (2)   The approved plan may not be transferred by the applicant to
another person, corporation, or group of individuals or corporations prior to
the issuance of a building permit, without the written approval of the Council
which shall be done by Resolution. A request for such a transfer or change of
ownership shall be presented to the Planning Commission for recommendation to
Council and granted by Council only if the new ownership entity satisfies the
administrative, financial, legal and all other performance guarantees approved
with the original PUD application. The ordinance approving such PUD shall
acknowledge this procedure for assignment of the PUD rights
   (i)    Expiration of PUD and General Development Plan Approval. An approved
PUD application shall remain valid for a period of twelve months following the
effective date of its approval. This period may be extended for up to six
months by the Planning Commission, after demonstration of just cause by the
applicant. If at the end of that time, a final development plan has not been
submitted, then the PUD application and General Development Plan shall expire
and shall be of no effect unless resubmitted and approved in accordance with
the previous provisions of this chapter. The ordinance approving such PUD shall
acknowledge this termination procedure.
(Ord. 2006-5. Passed 7-10-06.)

(Ord. 2006-5. Passed 7-10-06.)
1146.08 SIGNIFICANCE OF AN APPROVED PUD FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   An approved PUD final development plan shall become for the proposed
development a binding commitment of the specific elements approved for the
development. If the PUD includes the subdivision of land, a final plat must be
prepared and submitted to Planning Commission for signature in accordance with
the platting provisions for subdivisions. A final record plat must be submitted
for at least the first section of the development within eighteen (18) months
of the approval of the final development plan.
(Ord. 2006-5. Passed 7-10-06.)
1146.09 EXPIRATION OF PUD DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   An approved PUD final development plan that does not require a final
plat shall remain valid for a period of twelve months following the effective
date of its approval. This period may be extended for up to six months by the
Planning Commission, after demonstration of good cause by the applicant. If at
the end of that time a building permit has not been issued, then the PUD
application general development plan and final development plan shall expire
and be of no effect unless resubmitted and approved in accordance with the
previous provisions of this chapter. If the building permit expires without
construction having been started, the PUD application and subsequent plans
shall expire and must be resubmitted and approved in accordance with this
chapter. Construction is deemed to have begun when all necessary excavation and
piers or footings of one or more principal buildings included in the plan have
been completed.
   (b)   An approved PUD that does require a final plat due to subdivision of
the property shall remain valid for a period of six months following the
recording of the final plat. If after that
time bonds have not been secured and construction begun on required public
improvements, then the PUD application and subsequent plans shall expire and
will require resubmittal and approval in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. Building permits must be issued within six months of approval of a
final plat that does not require construction of public improvements, or six
months following the beginning of construction of public improvements.
(Ord. 2006-5. Passed 7-10-06.)
1146.10 MODIFICATIONS TO AN APPROVED PUD FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   Modifications to an approved PUD final development plan may be considered to
be minor modifications, significant modifications, or major modifications.
   (a)    Minor Modifications. The Zoning Administrator may authorize minor
modifications to a PUD final development site plan. Minor modifications shall
be the minimum necessary to overcome a particular difficulty or to achieve a
more functional and desirable use of the property than was initially
anticipated. These modifications have become necessary because of field
conditions, detailed engineering data, topography or critical design criteria.
Minor modifications may include adjusting the size and location of drainage
ways, sewers, circulation elements, retaining walls, or similar features and to
substitute, without reducing, landscape materials. Minor modifications may also
include structural dimensional changes provided they do not increase building
heights by more than ten feet, floor area by more than five percent, decrease
the number of parking spaces by more than ten percent or allow buildings closer
to the property lines. No minor modification shall result in a violation of any
subdivision or zoning requirement or any variance from these requirements
granted by a condition of the PUD approval. The Zoning Administrator or other
authorized official may deem any request for a minor modification to be a
significant modification and refer the request to the Planning Commission for
determination under the provisions set forth below.
   (b)   Significant Modifications. The Planning Commission may authorize
modifications to the PUD final development plan provided that the modifications
are consistent with the approved PUD and general development plan approved by
Council. The applicant shall submit significant modifications for Planning

1149.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   In the interest of promoting the general health, safety and welfare of
the residents of the Village of Golf Manor ("Village"), as more fully set forth
in the following purposes, these regulations are herein established to provide
for the use, location, size, height and design of signs, in order to ensure
that all signs are appropriate to, and compatible with, the character of the
associated uses and of the surrounding area.
   (b)   In establishing these purposes, the Village has determined that no
sign shall be permitted, erected or maintained as a main or accessory use
except in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, unless such
sign is exempted from the provisions of this Chapter.
   (c)   In establishing these purposes, the Village has determined that,
without adequate regulation and design standards, signs may become a nuisance.
The number of signs in the Village is excessive and is unduly distracting to
motorists and pedestrians, creates a traffic hazard, and in some places reduces
the effectiveness of signs required to protect the public. As the appearance of
the Village is marred by the excessive number, oversized and poorly-designed
signs, both residential and business property values are adversely affected.
Therefore, the number of such distracting signs ought to be reduced and signs
permitted should comply with the standards of this chapter in order to reduce
the aforementioned effects.
   (d)   In view of the foregoing, any sign that does not conform to the
regulations of this Chapter
1149 ("Chapter"), or any subsequent amendment thereto, shall therefore be
deemed a public nuisance, and as such, must be abated as provided herein. It is
further declared that the regulations contained in this chapter are the minimum
regulations necessary to abate the nuisance and to achieve the purposes of this
chapter.
   
   (e)   More specifically, the purposes of these regulations are to:
      (1)   Enhance and protect the physical appearance of the community.
      (2)   Promote and maintain attractive, high value residential, business,
retail, commercial and industrial districts, and preserve the scenic and
natural beauty of designated areas.
      (3)   Provide necessary, yet reasonable and appropriate, signage for all
residential, institutional and business uses in the community.
      (4)   Ensure that signs are located and designed to maintain a safe and
orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment, and to avoid confusion or
hazardous conflict between traffic control signs and devices, and any other
permitted sign.
      (5)   Enhance traffic and pedestrian safety.
      (6)   Provide the public with a safe and effective means oflocating
businesses, services and points of interest within the Village.
      (7)   Protect the rights of property owners and occupants to display
messages protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Therefore, the purpose of these regulations include the intention to remove any
doubt that it is the public's right to receive and display messages protected
by the First Amendment, including but not limited to, religious, political,
economic, social, and philosophical messages subject, however, to reasonable
regulations to assure safety and minimize visual blight. It is the further
purpose of these regulations to affirm that an expedient appeal process exists
that addresses these First Amendment concerns.
      (8)   Provide review procedures that enable and ensure the comprehensive
evaluation of a sign's appropriateness to the site, building and surroundings,
adherence to these purposes, and consistent enforcement of this Chapter's
regulations.
      (9)   Establish and enforce a reasonable procedure for the eventual
removal of legally nonconforming signs.
      (10)   Prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Chapter.

1149.03  APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   (a)    The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to and govern signs in all
districts. No sign shall be erected or maintained unless it is in compliance
with the regulations governing location and bulk of structures for the district
in which it is located, unless such sign is otherwise specifically regulated by
special use provisions relating to variances.
   (b)    Any sign already established on the effective date of this revised
Chapter, which sign is rendered nonconforming by the provisions of this revised
Chapter, and any sign which, as a result of subsequent amendments of this
Chapter, shall be rendered nonconforming, shall be subject to the provisions of
Section
1149.19.
   (c)    Wherever a commercial sign is allowed or permitted under this
Chapter, an owner may place a non-commercial sign, subject to the time, place
and manner provisions of this Chapter, without applying for a permit and/or
paying a fee that otherwise would be required for the placement of a commercial
sign on the lot; provided, that the sign structure or mounting device is legal
without consideration of message content. This provision prevails over any
provision to the contrary in this ordinance. The purpose of this provision is
to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over non-commercial
speech, or favoring of any particular non-commercial message over any other
non-commercial message. This provision does not create a right to increase the
total amount of signage on a lot or parcel, nor does it affect the requirement
that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted.
   (d)    All non-commercial speech is considered on-premise signage and is
entitled to the privileges that on-premise signs receive under this section.
   (e)    Notwithstanding any other provision herein, signs that display a non-
commercial message are entitled to the maximum square footage allowed any sign

shall be considered when calculating the fill volume;
      (2)   Cut or fill will exceed four feet in vertical depth at its deepest
point measured from the natural ground surface;
      (3)   Existing surface drainage is impaired or if the proposed work
within the project area constitutes a potential erosion hazard or acts as a
source of sediment deposit to any adjacent land or watercourse;
      (4)   Final slopes are steeper than 3:1;
      (5)   Fill placed on a surface having a slope steeper than 5:1;
      (6)   Existing stormwater runoff is altered in any way that affects

   (a)   The following principles are effective in minimizing erosion and
sedimentation and shall be included where applicable in the Water Management
and Sediment Control Plan:
      (1)   Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be
done in such a way that will minimize erosion. Whenever feasible, natural
vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
      (2)   Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
cut-fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with topography so as
to create the least erosion potential;
      (3)   The smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one
time and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a practical minimum. The
topsoil shall be preserved and returned to the surface of areas to be
revegetated, or new topsoil will be provided, or the surface shall be covered
with sod;
      (4)   Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practical with
temporary vegetation or mulching to protect exposed critical areas during
development;
      (5)   The permanent final vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development;
      (6)   Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after
development. Where necessary, detention/retention basins shall be provided
according to the requirements of this chapter.
      (7)   Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped by the use of debris
basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed
area is stabilized.
   (b)   The following standards shall be followed in preparing Water
Management and Sediment Control Plans:
      (1)   All lots, tracts, or parcels shall be graded to provide proper
drainage away from the building and dispose of it without ponding. Each lot
shall be graded such that water from the lot drains to a natural stream, swale,
storm sewers or other watercourse.
      (2)   All drainage provisions shall be of such design to adequately
handle the surface runoff.
      (3)   Concentration of surface water runoff shall only be permitted in
swales or watercourses.
      (4)   The installation of the specific water management and sediment
control measures shall be accomplished in accordance with the standards and
specifications contained in the Village Subdivision Regulations and the
Hamilton County Soil and Water Conservation District.

         (Ord. 91-10. Passed 8-12-91.)
1321.04 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Introduction.   
      (1)   Every subdivision and land development shall be provided with a
stormwater management system which is adequate to serve the area and meet the
requirements of this chapter and other criteria of the Village.
      (2)   Developers are required to design improvements such that in a 100
year storm, the rate of stormwater runoff leaving the project area at strategic
points is no more after development than if the project area had remained
undeveloped. If necessary, detention/retention facilities shall be constructed
to assure that this requirement is met.
Where an existing site is being partially or totally redeveloped all
requirements of this chapter will be in full force and effect. If conditions
warrant on partially redeveloped sites and the developer can show that the
application of all requirements would cause a hardship, he may request partial
relief from Planning Commission.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may waive requirements for an individual
detention/retention basin if a common or regional detention/retention basin of
adequate design is available or if the Village is reasonably certain one will
be constructed and if the major drainage system from the project area to the
common or regional detention/retention basin is such that the public health,
safety and welfare will not be in jeopardy.
If this option is exercised, the developer must agree in writing to participate
in the cost of the common or regional detention/retention basin whether already
constructed or planned. The amount of participation and method of collection
will be determined by the Village.
      (4)   It is not the intent of this chapter to hinder innovative and
creative solutions to drainage problems, however, in the interest of expediting
the processing of plans and construction, use of standard procedures, forms,
nomographs, charts, and computer programs is necessary. Deviation from these
standards will cause delay in the approval process.
      (5)   Although the submission requirements are specific, they are also
the minimum requirements. The Village Engineer may recommend to Planning
Commission a higher degree of protection than specified if the design results
do not appear adequate to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the
community.
      (6)   Stormwater management systems shall be designed for the ultimate
use of the land.
      (7)   Subsurface drainage such as underdrains may be required at the
discretion of the Village Engineer.
      (8)   Continued maintenance. Once a Storm Water Management Plan has been
approved and constructed it shall be the responsibility of the property owner
to maintain the facility as designed and constructed and to ensure its proper
operation to meet the intent and requirements of this chapter at all times.
   (b)   Stormwater Management System.
      (1)   The development of a comprehensive stormwater management system
requires providing two separate and distinct drainage systems, the minor system
and the major system.
         A.   The minor drainage system is for collecting and transporting
runoff from frequently occurring storms. It includes open channels, street
curbs and gutters, and underground storm sewers, manholes, catch basins, and
culverts. This system’s purpose is to lessen or eliminate inconveniences and
safety and health hazards associated with frequent storms. Except where
indicated otherwise, design criteria and requirements of this chapter are
directed to the minor drainage system.
         B.   The major drainage system is to insure that stormwater runoff
which exceeds the capacity of the minor drainage system has a route to follow
to the retention basin. It must be recognized that the major drainage system
exists even when it is not planned and whether or not physical facilities are
intelligently located in respect to it.
      (2)   Submission requirements for subdivisions. The following plans,
profiles and supporting documentation to verify conformance with this chapter
shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval of any subdivision.
         A.   Preliminary Plans. In addition to the subdivision requirements, a
plan showing the total area contributing runoff to the subdivision or project
area being considered shall be submitted with the preliminary plans. This plan
shall contain, but is not limited to, the following information:
            1.   A contour plan showing the outline of all areas outside the
project area that contributes runoff to it;
            2.   Estimated runoff (Q) before and after development for terminal
points along natural streams, proposed open channels, and other strategic
points such as existing storm sewers or culverts;
            3.   Location of proposed detention/retention areas;
            4.   Any other information required by the Village to clarify
intent.
         B.   Improvement Plans. In addition to the subdivision requirements,
the improvement plan for the project area shall contain, but is not limited to,
the following information:
            1.   Diameter, length, slope, type pipe, and class of all storm
sewers, culverts, and subsurface drainage;
            2.   Invert elevations on profiles of all pipes at terminal points
such as manholes, inlets, catch basins, and headwalls;
            3.   Top of grate elevations of manholes and grate flowlines of
catch basins and inlets;
            4.   Type of catch basin, inlet and manhole (ODOT or Village
designation);
            5.   Headwall type (ODOT or Village designation);
            6.   Actual existing and proposed cross sections of open channels
showing width of bottom, depth of water, erosion control measures and limits,
and side slopes at each point of design along with a profile indicating the
longitudinal slope and bottom elevations at the terminal points of design;
            7.   High and low points indicating the direction of runoff flow
along the profile of the roadway;
            8.   Structural details and design data for detention/retention
facilities;
            9.   Details of construction for all structures not included in the
Village standard construction drawings, or other referenced standards;
            10.   Easements;
            11.   Detention/retention facilities;
            12.   Any other information required by the Village Engineer to
clarify intent or design features.
         C.   Drainage and Grading Plans. In addition to the improvement plan,
a drainage plan shall be submitted. This plan may be the required improvement
plan or a similar plan at a scale of one inch = 100 feet or larger showing at
least the following additional information:
            1.   Contours indicating the existing and final grading at vertical
increments of no more than two feet;
            2.   Discharge (Q), coefficient of runoff (c) and drainage area (A)
along with the outline of the drainage area for each inlet, catch basin,
culvert and open channel point of design and other locations designated by the
Village Engineer. Drainage areas that lie partially outside the limits of the
drainage and grading plan may be delineated on any contour map acceptable to
the Village Engineer;
            3.   Discharge (Q) before and after development at strategic points
within and at extremities of the project area;
            4.   Delineation of the boundaries and contour elevation, along
with the track, of the major drainage system through downstream areas to an

            9.   All requirements of this chapter;
            10.   Any other information required by the Village Engineer to
clarify intent, specified requirements, or design features.
         D.   Supporting Data. All data and design information used for the
design of drainage facilities and for determining downstream flood information
shall be submitted with the drainage and grading plan. To facilitate review and
avoid confusion, legends, descriptions, and structure numbering used on design
forms or other calculations shall be identical to those used on the improvement
plans and the drainage and grading plan. This data shall include but are not
limited to:
            1.   Weighted runoff coefficient calculations for each contributing
area;
            2.   Pavement drainage computations;
            3.   Storm sewer computations;
            4.   Culvert design computations;
            5.   Open channel computations;
            6.   Detention/retention facilities computations;
            7.   Inlet capacity computations;
            8.   Any other information required by the Village Engineer to
clarify intent or design features.
         E.   As-Built Plans. Amended improvement plans specifying the
locations, dimensions, elevations and capacities of all facilities as
constructed shall be submitted to the Village on construction completion of the
project. These shall include all required design features except those waived
by the Village Engineer. All revisions to the approved plans must be approved
by the Village prior to construction.
   (c)   Stormwater Runoff Analysis.
      (1)   General. The design and construction of storm water facilities in
the Village is under the jurisdiction of the Village Engineer. Specific design
criteria shall be as required by the “Rules and Regulations of the Hamilton
County Sanitary Engineering Department for Storm Drainage”, unless specifically
superseded herein.
      (2)   Water management and sediment control. Storm drainage proposals for
any development shall reflect through investigation of the measures intended to
control sediment and manage storm water as required by this chapter. Water
management and sediment control plans are required of all development and
redevelopment unless specifically exempted herein.
      (3)   Stormwater retention/detention. In order to minimize storm runoff
damage to downstream properties and overloading of existing drainage courses,
the following criteria shall be followed on all development of parcels one acre
or larger in size, and on all redevelopment of existing buildings or site usage
as determined by Planning Commission.
         A.   Stage 1 shall allow the discharge of the ten year pre-developed
storm flow and provide for the detention of a volume equal to the ten year
storm flow, post-development, less the ten year pre- developed discharge.
         B.   Stage 2 shall allow the discharge of the twenty-five year pre-
developed storm flow and provide for the detention of a volume equal to the
twenty-five year storm flow, post-development less the twenty-five year pre-
developed discharge.
         C.   Stage 3 shall allow the discharge of the twenty-five year pre-
developed storm flow and provide for the detention of a volume equal to the 100
year storm flow, post-development, less the twenty- five year pre-developed
discharge. The detention volume shall be determined by multiplying the above
difference by twenty-five minutes. The method of retention is subject to
approval by the City Engineer.
         D.   Outlet flow control devices shall be multistage.
         E.   Other requirements may be imposed for specific cases.
         F.   All detention systems shall include an emergency overflow to
control the storm water flow when maximum storage capacity is surpassed.
         G.   No on-site storm drainage shall outlet downstream of the main
retention facility without providing supplemental retention as per the above
criteria.
      (4)   Storm sewers.
         A.   Minor Systems. All on-site storm sewers shall be designed based
on a ten-year storm curve with the exception of the retention outlet, unless
the specific development requires additional capacity. The retention outlet
shall be designed based on the runoff calculated in subsection (c)(3) hereof.
         B.   Major System.
            1.   A designated routing shall be designed to convey storm water
runoff which exceeds the capacity of the minor drainage system, i.e. storm
sewer without causing loss of property or any loss of life.
            2.   Surface runoff for the major drainage system shall be
determined using a storm frequency of 100 years. The runoff which the major
storm routing path shall convey shall be equal to the peak flow minus the flow
in the minor drainage system.
      (5)   Drainage calculations. A professional engineer licensed to practice
in Ohio shall submit detailed sewer calculations and drainage maps of
sufficient scale and contour interval to verify the proposed hydraulic design.
      (6)   Surface run-off. To determine the quantity of surface runoff for
areas up to 640 acres, use the “Rational Method”. (Q=CIA)
      (7)   Intensity of precipitation. The “point” values of average
precipitation intensity, ten inches per hour, at Cincinnati is shown below in
subsection (c)(8) hereof, taken from page 35 of U.S. Department of Commerce,
Weather Bureau, Technical Paper No. 25, “Rainfall Intensity-Duration- Frequency
Curves”. For any given storm duration (concentration time of runoff), the
curves show the average precipitation intensity of storms having 2-, 5-, 10-,
25-, 50- and 100-year frequencies. These values may be used for drainage
tributary areas of 300 acres or less. For acreage above 300, see subsection (c)
(9) hereof.

      (10)   Inlet time. At the head of the system the inlet time may vary from
ten to fifteen minutes, depending upon the size of the area and factors
affecting rapid runoff.
      (11)   Runoff coefficient. Compute a weighted value of the drainage
areas, using nine-tenths for roof areas and hard-surfaced paved area, nine-
tenths for sidewalk and macadam driveways, and four-tenths for unpaved areas,
yards, and lawns.
      (12)   Size of sewer. The size of the sewer shall be determined on the
basis of the hydraulic gradient to provide adequate capacity for the computed
runoff, using n = .015 for vitrified, concrete pipe, bituminous paved
corrugated metal, and brick sewers, and n = .013 for monolithic concrete
sewers. In no case shall the size be less than twelve inches in diameter.
      (13)   Depth. The minimum depth for storm sewers shall be planned to
provide clearance for all utilities and to permit inlet leads to be laid on not
less than two percent (2%) slope, with the invert of the inlet pipe at the
manhole, no lower than the top of the bench wall.
      (14)   Minimum and maximum velocities. Velocities in storm sewer pipe,
when flowing full at average peak flows, shall be no less than two and five-
tenths feet per second nor more than twelve feet per second, special provisions
shall be made to protect the sewer pipe against erosion and against
displacement by shock, or for checking the flow velocity.
      (15)   Gradients of pipe. The sewer pipe shall be laid on such gradients
so that the full flow velocities shall be kept within the foregoing stated
minimum and maximum. The pipe sizes should be so selected as to avoid large
differences in velocities between consecutive reaches.
      (16)   Manholes. Manholes shall be placed at intersections and termini of
sewers; at all changes in size, alignment, and slope of sewer; in pipe sizes
under thirty inches in diameter; at or near conversion chambers and curves on
sewers thirty inches in diameter or larger at points where inlets are to be
connected; and at intermediate intervals as required for maintenance.
      (17)   House connections. House connections shall be made to “Y”
junctions or to slanted junctions on sewers, and not to the manholes, unless
unavoidable.
      (18)   Inlets.
         A.   Capacity. The capacity of the inlet should not be less than the
quantity of flow tributary to the inlet. Inlets at low points or grade pockets
should have extra capacity as a safeguard for flooding from flows in excess of
design flows. Calculations shall be submitted verifying the capacity of each
inlet. Special inlets may be required for streets with steep gradients to
provide the extra capacity such situations require.
         B.   Type. The desirable minimum depth of a terminal inlet shall be
three feet from the inlet top to the invert of the outlet pipe. Any inlets
having a depth in excess of five feet shall be provided with manhole-type
steps. Wingwall and ditch-type inlets shall be used where required to drain
storm water from watercourses and drainage channels.
         C.   Location. The inlets shall be so located that they shall pick up
no more than five cubic feet per second, and this only when street grades do
not exceed six percent (6%) on either side of the inlet, and when the maximum
concentration of water on each side of the inlet does not exceed two and five-
tenths cubic feet per second. Inlets shall be located upstream of all sidewalks
at street intersections, crosswalks, driveways, and roadways; in all pockets in
streets, where a street grade flattens, and at intervals not greater than 350
feet in gutters.
      (19)   Outfalls.
         A.   When a storm sewer system outfalls into a flood plain of any
major watercourse, the outfall must not be subject to frequent floods or
backwaters. Standard wingwalls with erosion control shall be constructed for
all outfalls. Suitable baffles or other energy dissipaters shall be provided if
determined to be necessary by the Village Engineer.
         B.   The invert of the first storm sewer appurtenance upstream of the
outfall structure shall be above the elevations of the flood plain.
      (20)   Specifications for construction and materials. In all other
respects, the materials and construction shall be as specified in Sections 603,
604, 706, and 707, State of Ohio Department of Transportation “Construction and
Material Specifications”.
   (d)   Detention/Retention Basins.
      (1)   Introduction. Detention/retention of stormwater refers to storage
of excess runoff on the site of a development area or redeveloped area and
gradual release of the stored runoff at an acceptable rate. The detention
facility may be a dry surface structure, a pond or lake with additional
freeboard or underground structure. The parking lot may not be used to provide
for any of the detention requirements.
      (2)   Design.
         A.   In some instances, as determined by the Village Engineer, a
hydrograph method may be necessary to predict the length of time of high
discharge from a detention/retention basin. This determination will be made at
the preliminary plan state. It is the developer’s responsibility to obtain this
determination prior to beginning design procedures.
         B.   Allowable Discharge.
            1.   The volume and peak rate of runoff from an area after full
development shall not exceed the volume and peak rate of runoff from the same
area before development for twenty- four hour storms with frequencies of
twenty-five years.
            2.   For those areas where a study of the downstream area indicates
the extended time of high discharge or velocity due to restricted release rate
and storage may cause flooding or excessive erosion, the Village Engineer in
cooperation with the Hamilton County Soil and Water Conservation District may
require additional controls.
         C.   Detention Volume. The detention of storm water shall occur in
three stages.
            1.   Stage 1 shall allow the discharge of the ten year pre-
developed storm flow and provide for the detention of a volume equal to the ten
year storm flow, post-development, less the ten year pre-developed discharge.
            2.   Stage 2 shall allow the discharge of the twenty-five year pre-
developed storm flow and provide for the detention of a volume equal to the
twenty-five year storm flow, post- development less the twenty-five year pre-
developed discharge.
            3.   Stage 3 shall allow the discharge of the twenty-five year pre-
developed storm flow and provide for the detention of a volume equal to the 100
year storm flow, post-development, less the twenty-five year pre-developed
discharge. The detention volume shall be determined by multiplying the above
difference by twenty-five minutes.
            4.   Outlet flow control devices shall be multistage.
            5.   Other requirements may be imposed for specific cases.
            6.   All detention systems must include an emergency overflow to
control the storm water flow when maximum storage capacity is surpassed.
   (e)   Major Storms - Water Control.
      (1)   Introduction. Planning for the major storm is to insure that
stormwater runoff which exceeds the capacity of the drainage system has a route
to follow that will not cause loss of property or any loss of life. This system
exists whether or not it is planned.
      (2)   Criteria.
         A.   Storm Frequencies. Surface runoff for the major drainage system
shall be determined using a storm with a frequency of 100 years.
         B.   Total Runoff. The peak discharge of water will be determined as
previously outlined in this chapter. The peak discharge may be reduced by an
amount equal to the flow in the minor storm system as designed.
      (3)   Points of consideration.
         A.   All open channels, street cross sections, low points, and culvert
entrances will be considered as possible flood areas due to the 100- year storm
and will be included as part of the major storm investigation. The
investigation may include downstream facilities to a point designated by the
Village Engineer whether or not these facilities are contained within the
project area or controlled by the land developer requesting approvals.
         B.   All calculations will be submitted with the drainage plan.
            (Ord. 91-10. Passed 8-12-91.)
1321.05 APPROVAL PROCEDURES.
   (a)   The building permit review process shall not begin until the Water
Management and Sediment Control Plan, together with other submissions required
by this chapter are approved by the Village Engineer.
   (b)   Three copies of the complete plan and supporting data shall be filed
with the Building Department at least two weeks prior to the meeting of the
Planning Commission. The Village Engineer or his representative shall review
and recommend such changes or modifications as are deemed necessary to the
Planning Commission. There shall be paid at that time a fee of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for all plans required to include a Water Management and
Sediment Control Plan.
   (c)   The Village Engineer shall also refer a copy of the plans or extension
of previously approved plans requiring water management and sediment control
measures to the Hamilton County Soil and Water Conservation District for review
and recommendation as to adequate water management and sediment control
measures to prevent damage to other properties.
   (d)   The Planning Commission shall review these plans as submitted,
together with the recommendations of the Village Administrator, Building
Official, Village Engineer and the Hamilton County Soil and Water Conservation
District. If the Commission approves the plans, it shall so advise the Building
Official who shall insure compliance by the applicant with the plans as finally
approved.
   (e)   Every Water Management and Sediment Control Plan approval shall expire
and become null and void if the work authorized has not commenced within 120
days, or is not completed within two years from date of issue. The Planning
Commission may grant a reasonable extension of time if the permit holder
presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work
being started or completed within the specified time limits and if written
application is made before the expiration date of this permit.
   (f)   The Planning Commission and the Village Administrator shall make a
continuing review and evaluation of the methods used and overall effectiveness
of the storm water management and sediment control program.
(Ord. 91-10. Passed 8-12-91.)
1321.99 SUSPENSION AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   In the event any person holding an approved Water Management and
Sediment Control Plan pursuant to this chapter violates the terms of the plan,
or conducts or carries on the site development in such a manner as to
materially adversely affect the health, welfare, or safety of persons residing
or working in the neighborhood of the project area, or conducts or carries on
the site development so that it is materially detrimental to the public welfare
or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood, the Village
Building Official shall temporarily suspend the water management and sediment
control approval.
   (b)   Any person, firm or corporation violating any of the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction
thereof, in a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00). Each day such violation is committed or permitted to
continue shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable as such
hereunder.
