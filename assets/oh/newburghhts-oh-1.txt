Introduced by:
   AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER; AND
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Newburgh Heights, Ohio, has had the
matter of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for
some time, and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, are before
the Council,
   BE IT RESOLVED BY THE COUNCIL of the Village of Newburgh Heights, County of
Cuyahoga, and State of Ohio:
   SECTION 1. That the ordinances of the Village of Newburgh Heights, Ohio, of
a general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and
consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby
approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the Village of
Newburgh Heights, Ohio, 2004.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct

   SECTION 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided by

inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed
as of the effective date of this Ordinance except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or any action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.

of payment.
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness.
      (6)   The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges.

be viewed at any other location designated by Council. The Solicitor shall
review the summary prior to forwarding it to the Clerk for publication to
ensure that the summary is legally accurate and sufficient.
 
   SECTION 4. That each section of the Codified Ordinances without an ordinance
or resolution history at the end thereof indicates that the section contains
new material which is hereby enacted by this adopting ordinance.
 
   SECTION 5. That through authentication and approval of this Ordinance, the
Mayor and Clerk of Council shall certify that the permanent and general
ordinances of the Municipality as codified therein are correctly set forth and
constitute the Codified Ordinances of Newburgh Heights, Ohio, 2004.
 
   SECTION 6. That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, welfare and safety
for the reason that there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest
publication and distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and

   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

superseded by the Codified Ordinances. (ORC 1.23)

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation. (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable. (ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

133.08 CREDIT CARD POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose. In order to conduct Village business in a more efficient
manner, the Village has granted authority to certain employees and officials to
utilize Village credit cards for certain purchases. The purpose of this policy
is to supplement the purchasing policy set forth in Section 613 of the
Personnel Policy Manual, to comply with the mandates of H.B. 312 and Ohio
Revised Code Sections 9.21 and 717.31, and to set forth guidelines and
procedures regarding the proper use of Village credit cards. This policy is not
intended to replace applicable state law, but is intended to comply with
current state laws and establish more efficient, clear guidelines for elected
officials and other employees using Village credit cards. Utilization of a
Village credit card for personal use, in an unauthorized manner, or for the
purchase of any item or service not directly related to such official's or
employee's public duty will constitute a violation of this policy, may result
in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment, may
violate Ohio Revised Code Section 2913.21, and, in some instances, could
constitute a crime. Accordingly, all purchases made with a Village credit card
must be in accordance with these guidelines and state law.
   (b)   Definitions.  For purposes of this policy, "credit card account" means
any bank-issued credit card account, store-issued credit card account,
financial institution-issued credit card account, financial depository-issued
credit card account, affinity credit card account, or any other card account
allowing the holder to purchase goods or services on credit or to transact with
the account, and any debit or gift card account related to the receipt of grant
moneys. "Credit card account" does not include a procurement card account,
gasoline or telephone credit card account, or any other card account where
merchant category codes are in place as a system of control for use of the card
account.
   (c)   Guidelines and Procedures.
      (1)   The following persons are authorized to carry a credit card and/or
to make purchases utilizing a Village credit card account: (i) the Mayor; (ii)
the Chief of Police; (iii) the Fire Chief; and (iv) the Service Director. The
Mayor shall be permitted to designate his administrative assistant or any
Member of Council to make purchases under a Village credit card account. The
Mayor shall notify the Fiscal Officer of any such authorization given by the
Mayor to the administrative assistant or Member of Council. The Fiscal Officer
will verify the Mayor's authorization prior to processing any payment for
credit card charges made by the Mayor's administrative assistant or members of
Council. No other employees or officials are permitted to make any purchases
utilizing a Village credit card or Village credit card account, unless
specifically set forth in this policy.
      (2)   Use of a Village credit card or credit card account shall be
subject to the Village's spending limits as set forth in Section 613 of the
Personnel Policy Manual, entitled "Purchasing Policies."

presentation shall bear the name of the Village of Newburgh Heights.

subjected to any late fees or interest charges as the result of non-payment,
the official or employee may be personally liable for payment of or
reimbursement to the Village for said late fees or interest charges.
      (8)   Acquisition of any new credit card, issuance of any credit card,
and reissuance of any credit card shall occur only upon the agreement and
consent of the Mayor and Fiscal Officer. Notice of any new credit card

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
 
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
      In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipalty and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic
   violation bureau and specifies certain restrictions as to the designated
offenses and schedule of fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of
court appearance.
171.01   Clerk of Mayor's Court.
171.02   Court costs.
171.03   Late payment fee.
171.04   Collection of additional fine for fuel costs.

(Ord. 2004-14. Passed 4-20-04.)
181.05 DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX.
   (a)   Method of Determination.
      (1)   In the taxation of income which is subject to the Village income
tax if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession
within and without the boundaries of the Village of Newburgh Heights shall
disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is
attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted within the
boundaries of the Village, then only such portion shall be considered as having
a taxable situs in the Village for the purposes of municipal income taxation.
The portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer to be allocated as having
been derived from within the Village, in the absence of actual records thereof,
shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Multiply the entire net profits by a business allocation
percentage to be determined by a three-factor formula of property, payroll, and
sales, each of which shall be given equal weight, as follows:
            1.   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real
and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated.
               As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include
property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall
be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
            2.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to persons employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village, to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession,
wherever their services are performed.
            3.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made
and services performed during the taxable period in the Village, to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
services, wherever made or performed.
               In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not
produce an equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be
substituted as to produce such result.
   (b)   Sales Made in the Village. As used in subsection (a)(1)A.3. hereof
"sales made in the Village of Newburgh Heights" means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Village.
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village regardless of where title passes even though transported from a
point outside the Village if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village to purchasers outside of the Village regardless of
where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
   (c)   Total Allocation. Add together the percentages determined in
accordance with subsection (a)(1)A. or such of the aforesaid percentages as are
applicable to the particular taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the
number of percentages used in deriving such total in order to obtain the
business allocation percentage referred to in Section
181.05 .
   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the Village.
(Ord. 1968-13. Passed 6-25-68.)
   (d)   Rentals.
      (1)   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under Section
181.03, only if and to the extent that the rental, ownership, management or
operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so
rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through agents or
other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in the
whole or in part.
      (2)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, managment or operation of such properties is a business activity of
such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax; provided that in the case of commercial property, the rental is based on a
fixed or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts of profits of
the lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars
($250.00) per month; provided further that in the case of farm property, the
owner shall be considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in
crops or when the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts
derived from the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00) per month; and provided further that the person who
operates a licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether or
not the gross income exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per month.
         (Ord. 1973-33. Passed 11-20-73.)
   (e)   Operating Loss Carry Forward.
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to July 1, 1968 allocable to the Village may be applied against the
portion of the profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the Village, until
exhausted but in no event for more than five taxable years immediately
following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net operating
loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
      (2)   The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the Village in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the Village.
      (3)   The Clerk-Treasurer shall provide by Rules and Regulations the
manner in which such net operating loss carry forward shall be determined.
         (Ord. 1968-13. Passed 6-25-68.)
181.06 EXEMPTIONS.
   The tax provided for herein shall not be levied on the following:
   (a)   Pay or allowance of active members of the Armed Forces of the United

that such tax will be fully withheld within the Village, and any income earned
outside of the Village will be fully taxed at the same or higher rate of tax in
another municipality. If the estimated tax for the current year, less the tax

or receiving income in the Village.
Individuals.
   (A)    For residents of the Village, the income tax levied herein shall be
on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This
is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
182.02  (C)(16)).
   (B)    For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the Village, including any net profit of the nonresident, but
excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net profit or loss of
only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by the nonresident.
   (C)     For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
Taxable Income" as defined in Section

property pursuant to that nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   (i)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for
the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the Village with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the Village
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (d)    "Refundable credit" means the amount of Village income tax that
was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified deferred

proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Village for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
                  (b)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of
the employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified
deferred compensation.

   (E)   (1)   (a)    An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Village
for all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
Village on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if the Tax

          (b)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described
in division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in Village

individual;
         (f)    Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual regarding
the individual's residency;
         (g)    The primary location at which the individual is employed.
         (h)    The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,

residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Village. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact
period" with the Village if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of the Village and while away overnight from
that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in the Village.
      (3)    All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.

   (F)    This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Village, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in
the Village or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745. of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
182.04  (C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Village to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
Newburgh Heights may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
182.12  (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
182.12  (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,

a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within
Village and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)    The property is shipped from a place within the Village to
purchasers outside the Village, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its
own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at
the place where delivery is made.
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the Village to the extent that such services are performed in the Village.

royalties from real property located in the Village shall be sitused to the
Village.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the Village.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the Village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the Village.
The Village shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the
Village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the Village shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the Village. The individual may claim a credit for taxes
the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the Village's income tax ordinance.

section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

reporting location.
            (ii)   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)   "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;

         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:

or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
182.04 of this Chapter.

182.03  or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
182.03  of this chapter, of 2%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that

of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an

Administrator of the Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the Village in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the
last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and Village as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Village income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the Village during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year,;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section
Occasional Entrant - Withholding.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of

section, an employer is not required to withhold Village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed

more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)    The agreement between the employer and its customer to

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
182.04 .
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the Village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the Village.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the
Village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to
the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
182.02 , the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
182.04 . (Ord. 2015-75. Passed 12-1-15.)
182.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual Village income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
182.04  of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due the Village.
      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the Village income
tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Village, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Village, the return or notice required of that individual shall

conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be

   (E)    The Village shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to
support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who
files the annual return required by this section electronically is not required
to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to Village . No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
         (b)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the Village. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended
due date of the Village's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of
the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file
under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village's income tax return.
           (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Village income tax return. If
the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
Village income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Village's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Village an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   (I)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
182.04  or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
182.04  shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Village, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the Village and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter and of the Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the
Village's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by the Village during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Village before the 181st day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Village in accordance with
this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of
this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that
the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a
member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the president of
the United States or an act of the congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.

   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated
Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Village
income tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer
requests and receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a
separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Village income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.02 , by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
182.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05 , exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05 , include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall
not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's
net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
182.05 , exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
182.05  by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (a)   Commencing January 1, 2018 and expiring December 31, 2018, when the
taxable income of a resident of the Village of Newburgh Heights is subject to a
municipal income tax in another municipality on the same income taxable under
this chapter, such resident shall be allowed a credit of the amount of income
tax paid on such taxable income to such other municipality, equal to thirty
percent (30%) of the amount obtained by multiplying the lower of the tax rate
of such other municipality OR the tax rate of one percent (1%) by the taxable

the Administrator may by regulation provide. In the event such Village of
Newburgh Heights resident fails, neglects or refuses to file an annual return
or declaration on the form prescribed by the Administrator, he/she shall not be
entitled to such credit and shall be considered in violation of this chapter
for failure to file a return.
   (d)   The Village of Newburgh Heights shall grant a credit against its tax
on income to a resident of the Village of Newburgh Heights who works in a joint
economic development zone created under Ohio R.C. Section 715.691 or a joint
economic development district created under Ohio R.C. Section 715.70, 715.71,
or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit against its tax on income
to its residents who are employed in another municipal corporation.
   (e)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of divisions (a) and (b) of this section, "the
same income taxable under this chapter" subject to tax in the other
municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by dividing the tax
withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for that
municipality.

this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability

   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
182.18  upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village under Section
182.05  for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

182.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required

to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 2015-75. Passed 12-1-15.)
182.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
182.18 .
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the Village:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.21 .
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

       (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
182.18  (A)(4).
(Ord. 2015-75. Passed 12-1-15.)
182.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village is subject to recovery by the Village. If
the Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the Village
shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages.
   (C)    If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village's tax rate. However, if the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 2015-75. Passed 12-1-15.)
182.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
182.12  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is in accordance with the dollars,
no refund need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
182.09 .
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to Village
income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.

period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.21 . That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding,
or holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that

182.09 .
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
182.09 , with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
182.09 .
   (E)    No civil action to recover Village income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the

inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business

proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.

provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.

change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of

the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 2015-75. Passed 12-1-15.)
182.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village that arises pursuant to the Village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the Village:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 2015-75. Passed 12-1-15.)
182.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-75. Passed 12-1-15.)
182.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village ordinances or state
law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Village or the Tax Administrator.

      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.

182.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
      (1)   (a)    Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall
be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance
of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the
Village's income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax

provided in this chapter;
      (5)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the
withholding obligations described in Section
182.04 .
Verification of accuracy of returns and determination of liability.
   
   (B)   (1)    A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee
thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.18 , in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
182.99 .
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
182.19  within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.18 .
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99  for a violation of Section
182.17  and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
   (E)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

members shall be appointed by the legislative authority, (Newburgh Heights
Village Council), but such appointees may not be employees, elected officials,
or contractors with the Village at any time during their term or in the five
years (which applies only to these two appointments) immediately preceding the
date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor of Newburgh
Heights. This member may be an employee of the Village, but may not be the
director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other
similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or
any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Village Board of Tax Review shall be

appointed by the Mayor of the Village shall serve at the discretion of the
administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.

Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.
(Ord. 2015-75. Passed 12-1-15.)
 
182.22 AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS. 
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the legislative authority of the
Village, or a Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted to the
administrator by resolution or ordinance, to adopt rules to administer an
income tax imposed by the Village in accordance with this chapter and in
accordance with ORC Chapter 718. Such rules shall not conflict with or be

property in the Village.

tax herein provided for. Any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter
or any tax against or exception granted any individual or any of the several
groups of persons, or forms of income specified herein if found to be
unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or
invalidity shall affect only such clause, sentence, section or part of this

Regulations, including amendments that may be made from time to time, for use
as the Village's Income Tax Rules and Regulations. In the event of a conflict
with any provision(s) of the Village Income Tax Ordinance and the RITA Rules &

   The Tax Administrator is hereby instructed to deposit all moneys received
from the five percent admissions tax into the General Fund to be distributed by
appropriation to the individual funds as deemed to be in the best interest of
the community as determined by Council.
(Ord. 2001-17. Passed 4-17-01.)
187.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter:
   (a)    "Admission charge" means the charge made for the right or privilege
to enter into a place, or the charge or fee paid for the use of any facilities
or grounds including the amount charged or paid as annual membership dues to
any club or organization, or charge or fee charged or paid to use any
facilities for a season or longer, provided, however, that if such charge
includes rental of property or for a service such rental or service charge
shall be taken to be an admission charge. If a lesser charge is made to persons
who do not desire to use the property, facilities or services offered, the
lesser charge shal1 constitute the admission charge. The designation of a
charge as a rental or service charge, or fee of any kind, shall not be
construed to avoid the application of the tax if it is in effect a charge for
admission.
   (b)    "Tax Administrator" means the Director of Finance of the Village of
Newburgh Heights.
   (c)    "Place" includes, but is not restricted to, theaters, dance halls,
amphitheaters, auditoriums, stadiums, athletic pavilions and fields, golf
courses, driving range, baseball and athletic parks, circuses, side shows,
swimming pools, outdoor amusement parks and such attractions as merry-go-
rounds, Ferris wheels, dodgems, roller coasters and observation towers owned or
operated by any person.
   (d)    "Person" means any individual, receiver, assignee, firm,
copartnership, joint venture, corporation, company, joint stock company, park
board, municipal corporation, public authority created by statutes of Ohio,
association, society or any group of individuals acting as a unit, whether
mutual, cooperative, fraternal, nonprofit or otherwise.
      (Ord. 2001-17. Passed 4-17-01.)
187.03 LEVY OF TAX.
   There is hereby levied upon every person who pays an admission charge to any
place which is entirely or partially located within the Village:
   (a)    A tax of five percent (5%) of the admission charge paid for admission
to any place, including admission by season ticket or subscriptions or fee for
the privilege of using any facility. The tax shall apply to every admission
charge to any place which is entirely or partially located within the Village,
notwithstanding that the sale of the ticket or other evidence of right of
admission thereto is made outside of the Village;
   (b)    A tax of five percent (5%) of the admission charge paid for admission
to any public performance for profit at any roof garden, cabaret or other
similar entertainment in case the charge for admission is in the form of a
service charge or cover charge or other similar charge;
   (c)    A tax of five percent (5%) of the admission charge or other charge or
fee paid for the right or privilege to use any golf course, whether privately
or publicly owned or operated, including greens fees, and any annual or
seasonal membership charge or fee.
   If a place is not entirely located within the Village, the Tax Administrator
shall determine the percentage of the admissions charge attributable to the
portion of the place located within the Village. In making such determination,
the Tax Administrator shall consider appropriate factors such as the percentage
of the place's recreational and business activity which is conducted within the
Village. Alternatively, the Village and the facility in question which is not
located entirely within the Village of Newburgh Heights, Ohio, may, by
agreement, determine the appropriate amount of admissions tax by agreement.
Such agreement shall be approved by the Tax Administrator, ratified by Council
and shall reflect both parties' understanding that the alternative method
agreed upon is a reasonable determination of the admissions tax to be levied
upon that "place" as is not entirely located within the Village.
(Ord. 2001-17. Passed 4-17-01.)
   
187.04 EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   No tax shall be levied under this chapter with respect to any
admission, all the proceeds of which inure:
      (1)    Exclusively to the benefit of religious or charitable
organizations located in the Village, provided no part of the earnings thereof
inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual.
      (2)    Exclusively to the benefit of persons in the military or naval
forces of the United States, or of National Guard organizations, reserve
officer associations or posts or organizations of war veterans, or auxiliary
units or societies of any such posts or organizations, if such posts,
organizations, units or societies are organized in the State, and if no part of
their net earnings inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or
individual.
   (b)   Immediately after the event for which an exemption from the admissions
tax has been allowed, a responsible individual of the institution, society or
organization for whose benefit such event was held shall file an itemized
statement with the Tax Administrator setting forth the amount of money actually
received by the treasurer of such institution, society or organization,
together with the expenses of promoting and conducting such event. Such
statement shall be used as a basis of subsequent requests for exemption from
the admissions tax for the benefit of such organization, institution or
society. If such statement shows a disproportionate expenditure for the
promoting and conducting of such event in relation to the profits, if any, no
such exemption shall thereafter be allowed to such institution, society or
organization.
   (c)   The exemption from tax provided in this section shall not be allowed
to any institution, society or organization which does not control the sale of
admissions to the event for which the exemption is requested, nor shall any
exemption be allowed where talent, services or other items are compensated for
on a percentage basis if such percentage results in a payment in excess of the
flat rate ordinarily charged for the same talent, services or other items. The
exemption provided for shall be subject to the approval of the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2001-17. Passed 4-17-01.)
187.05 COLLECTION, PAYMENT AND INTEREST.
   (a)    Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under
this chapter shall collect the amount of the tax imposed from the person making
the admission payment. The tax required to be collected under this chapter
shall be deemed to be held in trust by the person required to collect the tax
until paid to the Tax Administrator as herein provided. Any person required to
collect the tax imposed under this chapter who fails to collect the tax, or
having collected the same, fails to remit such tax to the Tax Administrator in
the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of
his own act or the result of acts or conditions beyond his control shall
nevertheless be personally liable to the Village for the amount of such tax and
shall unless the remittance is made as herein required, be guilty of a
violation of this chapter.
   (b)    The tax imposed hereunder shall be collected at the time the
admission charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place and shall
be reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Tax
Administrator in monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before the
last day of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly period in which
the tax is collected or received.
   (c)    Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check,
unless payment or remittance is otherwise required by the Tax Administrator,
but payment by check shall not relieve the person collecting the tax from
liability for payment and remittance of the tax to the Tax Administrator unless
the check is honored and is in the full or correct amount. The person receiving
any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon such forms setting
forth such information as the Tax Administrator may require, showing the amount
of the tax upon admissions for which he is liable for the preceding monthly
period, and shall sign and transmit the same to the Tax Administrator with a
remittance for such amount, provided that the Tax Administrator may, in his
discretion, require verified annual returns from any person receiving admission
payments setting forth such additional information as he may deem necessary to
determine correctly the amount of tax collected and payable.
   (d)    Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition or amusement makes an
admission charge which is subject to the tax herein levied, and the same is of
a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Tax Administrator shall be the
judge, the Tax Administrator may require the report and remittance of the
admissions tax immediately upon the collection of the same at the conclusion of
the performance or exhibition, or at the conclusion of the series of
performances or exhibitions, or at such other times as the Tax Administrator
shall determine. Failure to comply with any requirement of the Tax
Administrator as to report and remittance of the tax as required shall be a
violation of this chapter.
   (e)    Any book, record or account of any person collecting a tax herein
levied, which relates in any manner whatsoever to admission charges, tax
collections or the percentage of the admission charge attributable to the
portion of the place located within the Village shall be subject to examination
and audit by the Tax Administrator at all reasonable times. If the tax imposed
by this chapter is not paid when due, there shall be added as part of the tax,
interest at the rate of one percent per month from the time the tax became due
until paid.
(Ord. 2001-17. Passed 4-17-01.)
187.06 REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE; FEE.
   Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which an
admission charge is made shall on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator,
make application to and procure from the Tax Administrator a Certificate of
Registration, the fee for which shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00), which
Certificate shall continue valid until December 31 of the year in which the
same is issued. Such Certificate or duplicate original copies thereof shall be
issued by the Tax Administrator without additional charge and shall be posted
in a conspicuous place in each ticket or box office where tickets of admission
are sold.
(Ord. 2001-17. Passed 4-17-01.)
187.07 TEMPORARY REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE.
   Whenever a Certificate of Registration is obtained for the purpose of
operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or
exhibition by persons who are not the owners, lessees or custodians of the
building, lots or place where the amusement is to be conducted, the tax imposed
by this chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in this chapter by
such owner, lessee or custodian, unless paid by the person conducting the
place. The applicant for a Certificate of Registration for such purpose shall
furnish with the application therefor the name and address of the owner, lessee
or custodian of the premises upon which the amusement is to be conducted, and
such owner, lessee or custodian shall be notified, by the Tax Administrator of
such Certificate and the joint liability for collection and remittance of such
tax.
(Ord. 2001-17. Passed 4-17-01.)
187.08 AUTHORITY TO MAKE RULES, REGULATIONS.
   The Tax Administrator is hereby authorized to adopt rules and regulations
not inconsistent with the terms of this chapter for carrying out and enforcing
the payment, collection and remittance of the tax herein levied. A copy of such
rules and regulations shall be published by posting in those places designated
by Council for posting of public notices at least once before they become
effective and copies shall be printed and made available in the office of the
Tax Administrator. Failure or refusal to comply with any such rules and
regulations shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
(Ord. 2001-17. Passed 4-17-01.)
187.09 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   The taxes herein levied and imposed shall be collected and paid on or after
June 1, 2001.

jurisdiction.
(Ord. 2001-17. Passed 4-17-01.)

who assists in the commission of any such violation, and any person who
violates any of the provisions of this chapter or fails to comply therewith,

or noncompliance be fined according to the provisions of Section

person or other entity who willfully fails or refuses to comply with the
provisions contained in this chapter, or any other rules or regulations
promulgated pursuant to this chapter, shall be entitled to do any business, or
conduct any activity in the Village, until they have fully complied with all

193.01 FINDINGS.
   The Council of the Village of Newburgh Heights finds that the enactment of
the Student Loan Assistance Grant Program will attract young professionals and
recent college graduates to live within its boundaries, and will result in the
maintenance of property values and the creation of a market for new housing and
safe and healthy housing facilities in the Village. Council finds that the
Student Loan Assistance Grant Program will help to stabilize or grow the
Village's population. Council also finds that the Student Loan Assistance Grant
Program will help to stabilize property values in the Village. Village Council
further finds that attracting young professionals and college graduates to
invest in home ownership in the Village will promote the local economy and may
help in job creation. To this extent, the Student Loan Assistance Grant Program
as set forth in this chapter will fulfill a public purpose and will assist in
the maintenance of the health, safety and welfare of citizens of Newburgh
Heights.
(Ord. 2020-24. Passed 5-5-20.)
193.02 STUDENT LOAN ASSISTANCE GRANT FUNDING.
   (a)   The Newburgh Heights Community Improvement Corporation (the "CIC")
shall create a line item fund for administration of the Student Loan Assistance
Grant Program. The Fund shall be maintained at a level as determined, from time
to time, by the CIC Board and through appropriation by Village Council of such
sums, from its General Fund, as may be determined by Council, which will be
earmarked for administration of the Student Loan Assistance Grant Program. Such
funds shall be used exclusively for the Student Loan Assistance Grant Program
created by these Guidelines.
   (b)   The Village will budget for and make annual deposits in the Student
Loan Assistance Grant Fund in amounts equal to the CIC's grant awards, on an
amortized basis.
(Ord. 2020-24. Passed 5-5-20.)
193.03 STUDENT LOAN ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAM.
   (a)    The CIC will provide student loan assistance to an Eligible Person
(as such term is defined in Section
193.04 of these Guidelines) who meets the requisite eligibility criteria as set
forth in Section
193.05 of these Guidelines, up to available amounts earmarked for said purpose.
The CIC Treasurer/Village Fiscal Officer is authorized and directed to pay a
given Eligible Person, from time to time, Student Loan Assistance Grants upon
satisfaction of all eligibility criteria. The Student Loan Assistance Grant
Program shall have a term of five (5) calendar years, beginning in 2019.
Thereafter, the Student Loan Assistance Program will renew for consecutive
terms of five (5) years, with the approval of both Village Council and the CIC
Board. Each five (5) year period shall be deemed a grant cycle.
   (b)   A Student Loan Assistance Grant shall be in an amount determined by
the CIC Treasurer/Fiscal Officer, but in any case shall not exceed the lesser
of fifty percent (50%) of the applicant's outstanding student loan debt or
fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), calculated at the time of the grant award
by the Newburgh Heights Community Improvement Corporation.
   (c)   A Student Loan Assistance Grant will not vest upon its award. A
Student Loan Assistance Grant will be paid in installments upon the achievement
of vesting milestones. Vesting shall not occur on a pro-rated basis. In order
for vesting to occur on any particular vesting date, the Eligible Person shall
be in full compliance with the requisite eligibility criteria for the program
for all periods of time up to and as of the vesting date. Grant awards shall be
paid at vesting milestones as follows:
      (1)   On the date that is the ten-year anniversary of the date on which
the Fiscal Officer/Treasurer approved and authorized a Student Loan Assistance
Grant, such grant shall be considered eighty percent (80%) vested, and the
Fiscal Officer shall pay the grant applicant an amount equal to the sum of
eighty percent (80%) of the awarded Student Loan Assistance Grant. Said payment
will be made by the CIC to the grant applicant within forty-five (45) days of
the date of vesting.
      (2)   On the date that is the fifteen-year anniversary of the date on
which the Fiscal Officer approved and authorized a Student Loan Assistance
Grant, such grant shall be considered one hundred percent (100%) vested, and
the Fiscal Officer shall pay the grant applicant the remaining balance of the
grant after deducting the previously paid eighty percent (80%) of the grant
paid to the Eligible Person during the applicable vesting periods. Said payment
will be made by the CIC to the grant applicant within forty-five (45) days of
the fifteen (15) year vesting date.
         (Ord. 2020-24. Passed 5-5-20.)

   (a)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or
private agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of
the person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this section, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under subsection (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that subsection.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the
vehicle only in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.

private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. "Private
residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

stored or left on any lots or lands in the Village for a period of more than
five (5) days, unless it is kept in a completely enclosed building or garage.
   (b)   Notification to Remove.
      (1)   When the Chief of Police ascertains that an abandoned motor vehicle
is parked, stored or left upon lots or lands with the Village, he, or someone
delegated by him, shall cause written notice and demand to be served upon the
owner, lessee or bailee of a motor vehicle or owner, lessee, agent or tenant
having charge of such lots or lands that such vehicle shall be removed from
such premises within forty-eight hours after the service of such notice. If the
owner or other person having charge of the lands is a nonresident whose address
is known, the notice shall be sent to that address by registered mail. If the
address of the owner is unknown, it shall be sufficient to publish the notice
once in a newspaper of general circulation in Cuyahoga County. Any police
officer of the Village may make service and return of the notice provided for
in this section.
      (2)   The forty-eight (48) hour period as prescribed herein shall be
deemed to commence from the day of the service or the date of publication, if
any.
      (3)   If the person notified fails to remove such motor vehicle within
the time prescribed by this section, the Village shall remove or cause to be
removed such motor vehicle and dispose of the same. All expenses and costs of
removal and/or disposal shall be charged against the owner of such motor
vehicle or the owner of the lots or lands upon which such motor vehicle is
parked, stored or left or both, and shall be in addition to any fine, cost or
penalty for which the owner of such motor vehicle or the owner of such lots or
lands may have become liable.
      (4)   Each day of violation of this section shall be deemed a separate
offense.
   (c)   Penalty. Whoever violates any provision of this section is guilty of a
minor misdemeanor. (Ord. 2004-18. Passed 4-20-04.)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)
303.11 PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO POLICE OFFICER.
   (a)   No person shall knowingly present, display or orally communicate a
false name, social security number or date of birth to a law enforcement
officer who is in the process of issuing to the person a traffic ticket or
complaint.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree.
(ORC 4513.361)
303.12 PROOF OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   No person shall operate, or permit the operation of, a motor vehicle
in the Village, unless proof of financial responsibility is maintained
continuously throughout the registration period with respect to that vehicle,
or, in the case of a driver who is not the owner, with respect to his operation
of that vehicle.
   (b)   The terms “motor vehicle”, “proof of responsibility”, and
“registration” as used in this section shall have the same definitions as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4509.01.
   (c)   The failure of any person who is the operator or owner of a motor
vehicle to provide a peace officer, at the time of a traffic stop in the
Village, with proof of financial responsibility in one of the forms permitted
by Ohio R.C. 4509.101(H), shall be considered probable cause and prima facie
proof that the driver and/or owner has not maintained proof of financial
responsibility as required by this section and by Ohio R.C. 4509.101.
   (d)   Whoever violates subsection (a) hereof shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor offense and shall be subject to a fine in an amount not to exceed
five hundred dollars ($500.00).
(Ord. 2010-10. Passed 3-16-10.)
303.99 GENERAL TRAFFIC CODE PENALTIES.

this Traffic Code for which violation no penalty is otherwise provided, is
guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)

this Traffic Code shall be imprisoned for a definite term or fined, or both,
which term of imprisonment and fine shall be fixed by the court as provided in

303.991 COMMITTING AN OFFENSE WHILE DISTRACTED PENALTY.
   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged

to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.

(ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.

Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by

the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;

   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available

such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
         B.   When preparing for a left turn;

vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,

analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.

under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the
offender to a jail term equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days
that the offender does not spend attending the program. The court may require
the offender, as a condition of community control and in addition to the
required attendance at a drivers’ intervention program, to attend and
satisfactorily complete any treatment or education programs that comply with
the minimum standards adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the
Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services that the operators of the
drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender should attend and to
report periodically to the court on the offender’s progress in the programs.
The court also may impose on the offender any other conditions of community
control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the
required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that the operators of the
drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender should attend and to
report periodically to the court on the offender’s progress in the programs.
The court also may impose any other conditions of community control on the
offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to

subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.

the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

353.01 DEFINITIONS.
   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them:
   (a)   "Parking meter" means a mechanical device installed for the regulation
of parking by lawful authority. Each parking meter shall contain a slot for the
deposit of lawful coin of the United States and a receptacle for receiving and
storing such coin. Each parking meter shall display brief directions as to its
operation and the value of lawful coin required to be deposited. Each parking
meter shall contain a timing mechanism which shall indicate either a balance of
legal parking time or overtime parking by an appropriate signal at the
expiration of such lawful time.
   (b)   "Parking meter space" means a space within a parking meter area, which
is designated for the parking of a single vehicle by marked lines on the curb
or paved surface area adjacent to a parking meter. Posted notice on the meter
or on signs shall indicate the maximum consecutive parking time limit during
which a vehicle may be legally parked in a particular parking meter space and
the days and hours when the requirement to deposit lawful coin shall apply.
353.02 PARKING WITHIN MARKED LINES OF METER SPACE.
   No person shall park a vehicle in a parking meter space in such a way that
the vehicle shall not be entirely within the limits of the space so designated
by marked lines.
353.03 DEPOSIT OF COIN REQUIRED; ILLEGAL PARKING.
   No person shall cause, allow or permit a vehicle to occupy a parking meter
space during the hours when the provisions applicable to such space are in
effect, unless he shall deposit such lawful coin of the United States of
appropriate denomination in the adjacent parking meter, as required by
directions on the meter. Such person is not required to deposit coin in a meter
which indicates a balance of unused legal parking time left by the previous
occupant of the space, so long as his occupancy of the space does not exceed
the indicated unused parking time. The parking meter space may be lawfully
occupied by such vehicle during the balance of legal parking time shown on the
meter provided such occupancy does not exceed the established maximum time
limit.
   No person shall fail to comply with directions displayed on the parking
meter or fail to set the timing mechanism in operation when so required.
   No person shall cause, allow or permit a vehicle to occupy a meter space
beyond the maximum consecutive parking time limit lawfully prescribed, for the
particular space occupied, by appropriate notice on the meter or on posted
signs, irrespective of the number or amount of coin deposited in such meter.
353.04 PARKING PROHIBITED IN METER SPACE.
   Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, no person shall park in a
parking meter space when otherwise directed by a police officer or fireman or

would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
his office or employment, except that if the section defining the offense
designates the officers, agents or employees for whose conduct the organization
is accountable or the circumstances under which it is accountable, such
provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of his office or employment.
   (b)   When strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated association, estate, trust or other commercial or legal entity.
"Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a governmental
agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.

the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a

of judgment against the person as described in that section.

organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not

the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed

505.20  VICIOUS DOGS.
   (a)   Definitions.
      (1)   As the term is used in this section, “vicious” dog means:
         A.   Any dog with a propensity, tendency, or disposition to attack
unprovoked, to cause injury or to otherwise endanger the safety of humans or
domestic animals;
         B.   Any dog which has been judicially or administratively determined,
pursuant to Section
505.20(b), to have a propensity, tendency or disposition to attack, to cause
injury or to otherwise endanger the safety of human beings or other domestic
animals; or
         C.   Any dog which has been judicially or administratively determined,
pursuant to Section
 505.20(b), to have attacked a human being or other domestic animal.
            (Ord. 2018-02. Passed 2-20-18.)
      (2)   A vicious dog is “unconfined”, as the term is used in this section,
if such dog is not confined on the premises of the person described in
subsection (c) hereof as follows:
         A.   If the dog is outside, it must be in a securely enclosed pen or
dog run area which has secure sides and a secure top attached to all sides and
which has a secure floor or bottom attached to all sides of the pen or which is
embedded in the ground no less than two (2) feet. Such pen or dog run area
shall be locked with a key or combination lock at all times when the animal is
within the structure.
         B.   If the dog is inside, it may not be kept in a house or structure
when the windows are open or when screen windows or screen doors are the only
obstacle preventing the animal from exiting the structure. A vicious dog may
not be kept on a patio, porch or in any part of a house or structure which
would allow the animal to exit the building on its own volition, whether or not
such a dog is on a chain or leash.
   (b)   Designation of Dog as “Vicious”; Appeal. A dog may be determined to be
“vicious”, as defined in Section
505.20(a)(1); and thus subject to the requirements of Section
 505.20, in one of the two following ways:
      (1)   A court of competent jurisdiction may declare the dog to be vicious
in an independent or related civil or criminal proceeding; or
      (2)   The Chief of Police or the designated Animal Control Officer may
provide written notice to the owner or other person harboring or having care or
control of the dog that the Chief of Police or the designated Animal Control
Officer has determined the dog to be vicious. Such notice shall be given by
personal service, ordinary mail, or by posting on the property at which the
person resides. Any person aggrieved by the order of the Chief of Police or the
designated Animal Control Office hereunder may appeal such order in writing to
the Village of Newburgh Heights Zoning Board of Appeals, which decision shall
be the final decision of the Village. Such appeal shall be filed within five
(5) working days of the date of notice, and heard within twenty (20) working
days of the date the appeal is filed. The filing of a notice of appeal
hereunder shall stay the requirements of Section
505.20, but shall not preclude the Chief of Police or the designated Animal
Control Officer of the Cuyahoga County Board of Health from impounding the dog
if otherwise permitted by this chapter or other provision of law and shall not
in any way relieve the owner or other person harboring or having care or
control of the dog from civil or criminal liability for injury or damage caused
by the dog or for violations of provisions of this chapter other than Section
505.20
   (c)   No person owning or harboring or having the care or custody of a
vicious dog shall permit such dog to go unconfined on the premises of such
person.

strength of 300 pounds and not exceeding three feet in length.
   (e)   No person shall own or harbor any dog for the purpose of dog fighting,
or train, torment, badger, bait or use any dog for the purpose of causing or
encouraging such dog to unprovoked attack upon humans or domestic animals.

hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) for each occurrence and insuring such
person against any claim, loss, damage, or injury to persons, domestic animals,
or property resulting from the acts, whether intentional or unintentional, of
the vicious dog. Such person(s) shall produce evidence of such insurance upon
the request of a law enforcement officer.
   (h)   In the event that a law enforcement officer has probable cause to
believe that a vicious dog is being harbored or cared for in violation of
subsections (b), (d), (e) or (f) hereof, the law enforcement officer may
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to order the seizure and impoundment
of the vicious dog pending trial. In the event that a law enforcement officer
has probable cause to believe that a vicious dog has gone beyond the premises
of a person owning, harboring or having the care or control of the dog, in
violation of subsection (c) hereof, the law enforcement officer may seize and
impound the vicious dog pending trial.
   (i)   No person shall own, harbor, care for, or control a vicious dog within

such form(s) as prescribed by the Chief of Police or the designated Animal
Control Officer. Persons owning, harboring, caring for or controlling a vicious

   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or
endangering, a misdemeanor of the second degree. If violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an
aircraft and if the violation creates a risk of physical harm to any person or

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

significantly, but does not equal the ambient environmental level more than
once during the period of observation.
   (k)    "IEC" means the International Electrotechnical Commission or its
successor bodies.
   (l)    "Intermittent noise" means a noise whose sound pressure level equals
the ambient environmental level two or more times during the period of

date, not to exceed thirty (30) days after the date the tenant gives the
required notice. If the tenant and landlord do not agree on a date to terminate

agreement shall terminate or the landlord shall remove the tenant's name from
the rental agreement thirty (30) days after the tenant gives the required

      (3)   At any time within thirty (30) days after a tenant having the

cotenant, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement as to any or all
cotenants.
      (4)   A tenant who terminates a rental agreement or removes the tenant's
name from a rental agreement is liable for the tenant's share of rent, prorated

      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in section 5321.16 of the Ohio Revised

to retain the tenant's share of any security deposit.

the tenant's name from a rental agreement pursuant to subsection (b) of this
section, a landlord may offer the tenant an opportunity to rent another unit at
the location that is sufficiently distant from the tenant's current unit.
Whether to accept that offer is at the tenant's discretion.
   (d)    No landlord shall knowingly terminate a tenancy because of the status
of a tenant or household member as a victim of domestic violence or the offense
of menacing by stalking, because the tenant or a household member requested
emergency services as such a victim, or because the tenant previously
terminated a rental agreement in accordance with this section.
   (e)    A tenant who is injured by a landlord's violation of subsection (d)
of this section may recover damages in the amount of one month's rent and any

agreement pursuant to subsection (b) of this section during the previous five
(5) years.
(Ord. 2019-30. Passed 9-17-19.)
726.02  OBLIGATION TO CHANGE LOCK.
   (a)    A landlord of a tenant who is a victim of domestic violence or the
offense of menacing by stalking shall change the lock to the dwelling unit
where the tenant resides upon receipt of a written request from the tenant and
a copy of a court order or protection order that orders the respondent or
defendant named in the order to stay away from the tenant. Within forty-eight
(48) hours after receiving the notice and a copy of the order, the landlord
shall change the lock and shall make a good faith effort to provide a key to
the new lock to the tenant and any remaining cotenant not later than twenty-
four (24) hours after the landlord changes the lock. The tenant shall reimburse
the landlord for the actual expense the landlord incurs in changing the lock.
If the landlord fails to change the lock within the forty-eight (48)-hour time
period as this section requires, the tenant may change the lock without the
landlord's permission. If the tenant changes the lock, the tenant shall do so
in a competent and workmanlike manner with locks of similar or better quality
than the original lock and shall make a good faith offer to provide a key to
the landlord and any remaining cotenant not later than twenty-four (24) hours
after the tenant changes the lock. If within thirty (30) days after the
landlord changes the lock the tenant does not reimburse the landlord for the
expenses the landlord incurs in changing the locks, the landlord may deduct
that amount from the security deposit or assess that amount as a charge to the
tenant.
   (b)   (1)    A landlord who receives a request and copy of an order under
this section shall not, by any act, provide the respondent who is named in the
order and who is a tenant of the dwelling unit access to the dwelling unit for
which the landlord or tenant has changed the locks unless the order allows the
respondent to return to the dwelling unit to retrieve the respondent's personal
possessions and the respondent is accompanied by a law enforcement escort.
      (2)    A respondent who is a tenant of the dwelling unit remains liable
under the rental agreement for rent or any damage to the dwelling unit as
provided in the rental agreement, unless the respondent can demonstrate that
the tenant who changed the lock or had the lock changed intentionally damaged
the dwelling unit.
   (c)    A landlord who changes a lock to a dwelling unit in accordance with
this section is not liable for excluding from the dwelling unit a respondent
named in an order the landlord receives from a tenant under this section or for
loss of use or damage to the respondent's personal property while that property
is in the dwelling unit after the lock has been changed.
   (d)    If a landlord takes action to prevent a tenant who has complied with
this section from changing a lock, the tenant may seek a temporary restraining
order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction ordering the landlord to
refrain from preventing the tenant from changing the lock. (Ord. 2019-30.
Passed 9-17-19.)
726.03 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)    Except to the extent that a landlord reasonably believes it is
necessary to share information for the safety of any tenant or any other
person, any information a landlord receives from a tenant under Section
726.01 or
 726.02 is confidential. A landlord shall not share any confidential
information with any other past, current, or prospective landlord, and a
landlord shall not share any information with respect to a tenant's status as a
victim of domestic violence or the offense of menacing by stalking with any
other past, current, or prospective landlord. If the tenant shares any
information that the tenant provides to a landlord under this section, that
sharing does not waive the confidentiality of the information or the nature of
the privileged communication.
   (b)    A landlord is not liable for any good faith violation of the
confidentiality requirement this section establishes.
(Ord. 2019-30. Passed 9-17-19.)
726.04 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONVICTION.
   If a tenant has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
section 2919.25 of the Ohio Revised Code or substantially similar municipal
ordinance while the tenant was subject to the rental agreement, the landlord
may terminate the tenant's rental agreement or may remove the tenant's name

deposit.

boundaries of the Village, regardless of where the wastes are generated and
ultimately disposed, of twenty-five cents (25¢) per ton of solid waste
transferred through a solid waste transfer or processing facility located in
the Village and ultimately disposed of in any approved solid waste disposal
facility which shall hereinafter be referred to as a Solid Waste Transfer Fee.
Consistent with the mandates of House Bill 592, the solid waste transfer fee

tonnage of solid wastes transferred from the solid waste transfer or processing
facility for disposal at a solid waste disposal facility, the total fee to be
collected by the recipient solid waste disposal facility and shall name each
recipient solid waste disposal facility. The recipient return forms shall be
notarized. A copy of this form will also be sent to the owner or operator of
the solid waste disposal facility receiving solid waste from a Village solid
waste transfer or processing facility. The recipient solid waste disposal
facility will then remit the solid waste transfer fee to the Village along with
a copy of the corresponding recipient return form. Not later than thirty days
after the end of the month to which such a return applies, the owner or
operator of each recipient solid waste disposal facility shall mail to the
Administrator the recipient return form for that month together with the fees
collected during the month as indicated on the return. The owner or operator of
the solid waste disposal facility may request an extension of not more than
thirty days for filing the return and remitting the fees, provided that he has
submitted such a request in writing to the Administrator together with a
detailed description of why the extension is requested. The Administrator must
have received and approved the request in writing not later than the day on
which the return is required to be filed.
      (2)   If the fees are not remitted within sixty days of the last day of
the month during which they were collected, the owner or operator shall pay an
additional fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the fees for each month or
fraction thereof that they are late.
      (3)   The books, records and accounts of any owner or operator of a solid
waste disposal facility that is receiving solid waste from a Village solid
waste transfer or processing facility shall, at all reasonable times, be
subject to examination and audit by the Administrator.
      (4)   The books, records and accounts of any owner or operator of a solid
waste transfer or processing facility within the boundaries of the Village

rules and regulations not inconsistent with the terms of this section for
carrying out and enforcing the payment and remittance of the fees levied as
well as the filing of recipient return forms. A copy of any rules and
regulations shall be posted in the manner provided by chapter at least once
before they shall become effective. Copies shall be available from the
Administrator and to the owner or operator of any approved solid waste facility

classification, plus actual costs and expenses incurred by the Village,
including costs for fuel or for the rental of any equipment. The applicant will
agree to pay in full prior to filming, or promptly upon receipt of an invoice,
the charges incurred. If Village personnel have been assigned to the filming
and actual filming time turns out to be different than that estimated on the

completed.

devices and equipment to be used in connection with the filming and taping, if
required by the Mayor and/or if deemed prudent by the department head. The Fire
Department may determine that no standby Fire Department personnel are
required, but that an inspection will be needed.
   (h)    Any permit granted by the Village under the provisions of this
Section may be revoked by the Mayor, including when the person who maintains,
owns, controls or operates such filming permits the violation of any provision
of the Village's Codified Ordinances or State laws or where, in the opinion of

safety. Revocations or suspensions may be appealed to the Village Board of

      (3)    If a building or occupancy permit is refused, the Building
Commissioner shall send the notice of refusal to the address shown on the

remain in full force and effect, save and except that this Planning and Zoning
Code shall supersede all rules of the Building Code, which are in conflict with
the terms and provisions of this Planning and Zoning Code.
   (e)   Separability. The sections, subsections, districts and building lines
forming parts of, or established by this Code and the several parts, provisions
and regulations thereof are hereby declared to be independent sections,
subsections, districts, buildings lines, areas, limitations, provisions and
regulations; and the holding of any such section, subsection, district,
building line, part, provision or regulation thereof to be unconstitutional,
void or ineffective for any cause, shall not effect nor render invalid any
other section, subsection, district, building line, part, provision or
regulation thereof or hereof.
   (f)   Violations.  No person shall locate, erect, construct, reconstruct,
enlarge, change, repair, structurally alter, occupy or use any building or land

building or premises or part thereof, where anything in violation of this Code
shall be placed or shall exist, or be maintained and any architect, builder,
contractor, agent or other person who may be employed to assist in the
commission of any such violation, and all persons or corporations who shall
fail to comply therewith or with any requirements thereof, or who shall build
in violation of any detailed statement of plans submitted and approved
thereunder, shall for each and every violation or noncompliance, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than five

1115.03   Limitations.
1115.04   Public hearing and notification.
1115.05   Board of Zoning Appeals action.
1115.01 APPEALS.
   (a)    If a building or occupancy permit is refused by the Building
Commissioner, an appeal, in writing, may be made to the Board of Zoning
Appeals. Such appeal may be made to the Board by any elected Village official,
or by any person aggrieved or affected by any decision. Such appeal shall be
filed within fourteen (14) days after such decision by the Building
Commissioner is rendered and shall be filed with the Building Commissioner.
Upon request of such appeal, the Building Commissioner shall immediately
transmit to the Board such appeal, together with the permit application, plans,
maps and other data in his or her possession which may be useful to the Board
in arriving at the proper decision.
   (b)    An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the Building Commissioner from whom the appeal is taken certifies
to the Board of Zoning Appeals after the notice of appeal is filed with him,
that by reason of facts stated in the application, a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case proceedings
shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by
the Board of Zoning Appeals or by a court of record on application, on notice
to the Building Commissioner from whom the appeal is taken on due cause shown.
(Ord. 2017-49. Passed 12-5-17.)
1115.02 VARIANCES.
   (a)    Any person requesting a variance from the provisions of this Code for
the district in which his or her property is located may apply to the Board for
such variance. Such application shall be made in writing to the Building
Commissioner.
   (b)    Such an application shall include:
      (1)   Name, address, and phone number of applicants.
      (2)   Legal description of the property.
      (3)   Description of the nature of the variance.
      (4)   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to the following standards:
         A.   That special circumstances and conditions exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district;
         B.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this ordinance;
         C.   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant;
         D.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this ordinance to other
lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
   (c)    Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific cases
such variance from the terms of this Code as will not be contrary to the public
interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this Code would result in practical difficulty or in unnecessary
hardship, as applicable. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures,
or buildings in the same district and no permitted or nonconforming use of
lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds
for issuance of a variance. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of
convenience or profit, but only where strict application of the provisions of
this Code would result in practical difficulty or in unnecessary hardship, as
applicable. A variance shall not be granted unless the Board makes specific
findings of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to it,
which support conclusions that the standards stated above have been met.
   (d)    In approving a variance, the Board may designate such conditions in
connection therewith as will, in its opinion, protect the health, safety,
attractiveness and values of adjoining property. Permits approved by the Board
for exceptions and variances from the regulations of this Code shall be void
after one (1) year from the date of such approval, unless, in the case of new
construction, work has been done above the foundation walls, and, in cases of
occupancy of land or reconstruction or occupancy of buildings, the operation
called for by such permit is well under way by the end of such one (1) year
period.
(Ord. 2017-49. Passed 12-5-17.)
1115.03 LIMITATIONS.
   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant an appeal or
variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this Code in the
district involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the
terms of this Code in said district. In granting any appeal or variance, the
Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in
conformity with this Code.
(Ord. 2017-49. Passed 12-5-17.)
1115.04  PUBLIC HEARING AND NOTIFICATION.

the Board of Zoning Appeals shall either approve, approve with supplementary
conditions, or disapprove the request for appeal or variance. The Board shall
further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify
the granting of the variance that will make possible a reasonable use of the
land, building, or structure. A copy of all decisions or determinations of the
Board shall be transmitted to the Building Commissioner.
   (b)   Fees.  A written appeal or application for a variance shall be
accompanied by a fee payable to the Village. A schedule of such fees shall be
made available through the Village and may be altered or amended only by
Council. All fees shall be paid in full before any decision is rendered. (Ord.

1117.01 OVERVIEW.
   In recent years, the characteristics and effects of an ever-increasing
number of new and unique uses, together with the broadening of numerous
conventional uses, have fostered the development of more flexible regulations
designed to accommodate these activities in a reasonable and equitable manner,
while safeguarding both the property rights of all individuals and the health,
safety and general welfare of the community. Toward these ends, it is the
intent of this chapter to provide for a more detailed evaluation of each use
conditionally permissible in a specific district with respect to such
considerations as location, design, size of development, method or methods of
operation, intensity of use, public facilities requirements, and traffic
generation. Accordingly, conditional use permits shall conform to the
procedures and requirements of this Chapter of this Code. (Ord. 2017-49. Passed

CHAPTER 1119
Nonconforming Uses
1119.01   Overview.
1119.02   Continuation, enlargement or expansion.
1119.03   Building under construction.
1119.04   Change in use.
1119.05   Restoration and repair.
1119.06   Abandonment.
1119.07   Common ownership.
1119.08   Conditional use provisions.
1119.01 OVERVIEW.
   Within the districts established by this Code, or amendments that may later
be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which
were lawful prior to adoption or amending of this Code but which would be
prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this zoning code or
amendments thereto. The legitimate interests of those who lawfully establish
these nonconformities are herein recognized by providing for their continuance,
subject to regulations limiting their completion, restoration, reconstruction,
extension, and substitution. Except as provided in this Chapter, a lawful
building, structure or use existing on the effective date of this Code may be
continued even though such building, structure or use does not conform to the
provisions of this Code for the district in which such building or use is
located. Nevertheless, while it is the intent of this Code that such
nonconformities be allowed to continue until removed, they should not be
encouraged to survive. Therefore, no nonconformity may be moved, extended,
altered, expanded, or used as grounds for any other use(s) or structure(s)
prohibited elsewhere in the district except as otherwise specifically provided
for in this Chapter.
(Ord. 2017-49. Passed 12-5-17.)
1119.02 CONTINUATION, ENLARGEMENT OR EXPANSION.
   Any use of land or buildings, and any design of buildings or location of
buildings on a lot, lawfully existing on the effective date of applicable
zoning regulations, may be continued even though such use, design or location
does not conform to the regulations of this Code for the district in which it
is located, provided however, that no enlargement or expansion of such
nonconforming building or use shall be made.
(Ord. 2017-49. Passed 12-5-17.)
1119.03  BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
   No change is required by this Code in the plans, construction or designated
use of a building which does not conform to the regulations of this Code for
the district in which its premises are located, provided that construction
thereon was lawfully begun before passage of this Code, and upon which actual
construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is defined to
be the actual placing of construction materials in their permanent place,
fastened in a permanent manner, providing further, that the actual construction
of the work shall be diligently carried on until the completion of the
building.
(Ord. 2017-49. Passed 12-5-17.)
1119.04 CHANGE IN USE.
   (a)    No change of a nonconforming use shall be made to a less restricted
use.
   (b)    Ordinary repairs, replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring
or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) of the
building's assessed value, according to the assessments of the County Auditor
of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, shall be permitted to a nonconforming use or building
provided such repair and maintenance is completed within any consecutive
twenty-four (24) month period. Any part of a nonconforming building declared to
be unsafe by the Building Commissioner and required by him/her to be
strengthened or restored to a safe condition shall be permitted to be
strengthened or restored to a safe condition.
   (c)    No structural change shall be made in a nonconforming building,
except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, unless it is changed to a
conforming building and use or unless the change is approved by the Building
Commissioner upon finding that the change is in the direction of conformity and
will not extend unduly the life of an objectionable nonconforming use in the
neighborhood.
   (d)    So long as no structural alterations are made, except as required by
enforcement of other codes or ordinances, any nonconforming use may, upon
appeal to, and approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals, be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same classification or less intense classification if
the Board shall find that the use proposed for substitution is not more
injurious to neighborhood safety and property values than the existing use. In
permitting such change, the Board may require additional conditions and
safeguards be met, which requirements shall pertain as stipulated conditions to
the approval of such change.
(Ord. 2017-49. Passed 12-5-17.)
1119.05 RESTORATION AND REPAIR.
   (a)    No building which has been damaged by fire or other causes to the
extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of its assessed tax valuation at the
time it was so damaged shall be repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with
the regulations for the building and land for the district in which the
building is located.
   (b)    Where the damage sustained represents less than fifty percent (50%)
of its assessed tax valuation at the time it was so damaged, or when the
building has been declared unsafe by the Building Commissioner or other
authorized administrative official, it may be replaced and restored and devoted
to the same or a more restricted use, provided that such repair or restoration
is completed within six (6) months of the fire or other cause of such damage or
within six (6) months from the time the building is declared unsafe.
(Ord. 2017-49. Passed 12-5-17.)
1119.06 ABANDONMENT.
   (a)    A nonconforming use which has been abandoned shall not be replaced by
another nonconforming use.
   (b)    A nonconforming use shall be deemed abandoned when the nonconforming
use has been replaced by a conforming use, or when the nonconforming use has
ceased and has not been resumed for a continuous period of six (6) months.
   (c)    A nonconforming use of a building or property shall be deemed
abandoned when it has been replaced by a conforming use or when the
nonconforming use has ceased and the intent of the owner to discontinue the use
is apparent, or when the characteristic equipment and furnishings of the
nonconforming use have been removed from the premises and have not been
replaced by similar equipment for a continuous period of six (6) months.
(Ord. 2017-49. Passed 12-5-17.)
1119.07 COMMON OWNERSHIP.
   Where two (2) or more contiguous nonconforming recorded lots are held in or
come into common ownership, they shall be subject to the following provisions,
in addition to limitations imposed by other provisions of this Code:
   (a)   Where two (2) or more nonconforming recorded lots, or a combination of
such lots and portions of lots, with continuous frontage, are held in common
ownership, they shall be considered as being within the same zoning district
and shall be subject to all requirements applicable to the district in which
such lots are located.
   (b)   If two (2) or more nonconforming recorded lots, or a combination of
such lots and portions of lots, with continuous frontage, are held in common
ownership, and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this ordinance and no
portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot width and area requirements of the district in which such
lot is located, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which leaves
remaining any lot with width or area below that required for the district in
which such lot is located.
      (Ord. 2017-49. Passed 12-5-17.)
1119.08 CONDITIONAL USE PROVISIONS.
   (a)   General. In any district in which single-family or two-family
dwellings are permitted, such dwellings and customary accessory buildings may
be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Code, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions
of this Code. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous
frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even
though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that
are applicable to the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements
other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform
to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
   (b)   Uses under Conditional Provisions. Any use which is permitted as a
conditional use in a district under the terms of this ordinance shall not be
deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further action
be considered a conforming use.

1133.01 OVERVIEW.
   (a)   General.  The Table of Allowable Uses lists the uses allowed within
all base zoning districts. All uses are defined within Section
1103.02(c), Definitions, of this Code. Approval of a use listed within this
table, and compliance with the applicable use-specific standards for that use,
authorizes that use only. Development or use of a property for any other use
not specifically allowed within the "Table of Allowable Uses" and approved
under the appropriate process is prohibited.
   
   (b)   New and Unlisted Uses. The Village recognizes that new types of land
use will develop, and various forms of land uses not originally anticipated in
this code may seek to locate within the limits of the Village. When an
application is made for a use category or use type that is not specifically
listed within the Allowable Uses Table, the Planning Commission shall make a
determination as to the appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form
of land use in the following manner:
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall provide an interpretation as to the
zoning classification into which such use should be placed. In making such
interpretation, the Planning Commission shall consider the nature of the use
and whether it involves dwelling activity; sales; processing; type of product,
storage and amount, and nature thereof; enclosed or open storage; anticipated
employment; transportation requirements; the amount of noise, odor, fumes,
dust, toxic material, and vibration likely to be generated; and the general
requirements for public utilities such as water and sanitary sewer.
      (2)   Standards for new and unlisted uses may be interpreted as those of
a similar use.
      (3)   Appeal of the Planning Commission's decision shall be made to the
Village Council following procedures under Chapter
1115, Appeals and Variances, of this Code. (Ord. 2017-49. Passed 12-5-17.)

1133.04 ADULT ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES.
   (a)   General .
      (1)    Purpose. It is the purpose of this Chapter to regulate Adult
Entertainment Businesses in order to promote the health, safety, moral and
general welfare of the citizens of the Village, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of
Adult Entertainment Businesses within the Village. The provisions of this
chapter do not have the purpose or effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually
oriented materials. Further, it is not the intent of this chapter to restrict
or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
the effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
      (2)    Findings. The Village Council has received substantial evidence
concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community in
findings incorporated in the cases of City of Fenton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.
475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1979), and
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on studies in other
communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Tucson, Arizona;
Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California;
Indianapolis, Indiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Paul, Minnesota; New York,
New York; Cleveland, Ohio; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Amarillo, Texas; Austin,

1137.04 VILLAGE SIGNAGE.
   (a)   General.
      (1)    It is the intent of this Chapter to provide for the placement,
location and size of signs in a sensible manner in the interest of promoting
the general health, safety and welfare of residents of Newburgh Heights. As
more specifically set forth herein, the purposes of these sign regulations are
to:
         A.   Promote and maintain attractive, high value residential,
commercial, and industrial districts and public lands and streets by preventing
the blighting influence of excessive signage.
         B.   Provide reasonable, yet appropriate, conditions for identifying
residential developments, institutions, public facilities, businesses and
industrial establishments.
         C.   Control the size and location of signs so that signs will be
aesthetically harmonious with both their surroundings and the design of
adjacent buildings.
         D.   Control the number of signs in order to provide an attractive and
uncluttered environment.
         E.   Eliminate any conflict which would be hazardous between
identification signs and traffic control signs and devices.
         F.   Ensure that signs are located and designed to maintain a safe and
orderly pedestrian and vehicular environment by discouraging signs which are
confusing and distracting due to the number of colors, size, location, or glare
of lights, thereby preventing hazards to pedestrians and motorists.
         G.   Provide review procedures which enable the Village to
comprehensively evaluate the appropriateness of the sign to the site, building
and surroundings.
         H.   Provide for the control of temporary signs to avoid the unsafe
conditions and blighting influence of excessive and/or deteriorating temporary
signage.
         I.   Prohibit all signs not expressly permitted by this Code.
      (2)    In establishing these purposes, the Village has determined that
signs which do not comply with these regulations are a public nuisance.
Unregulated signs are unduly distracting to motorists and pedestrians, and
thereby create a traffic hazard and reduce the effectiveness of signs needed to
direct the public.
         A.   The signs of least value to the people of Newburgh Heights are
those which carry commercial messages other than the advertisement of any
product, service, event, person, institution or business located on the
premises where the sign is located.
         B.   In view of the foregoing, all signs not conforming to the
provisions of this chapter are hereby declared a nuisance. It is further
declared that the regulations contained in this chapter are the minimum
regulation necessary to abate the nuisance and to achieve the purposes of this
Chapter.
   (b)   Establishing Regulations.

electric lighting and all parts of reflectors shall be of noncombustible
material.
      (5)    Tests for Approved Combustible Plastics. Approved combustible
plastic is any plastic material more than 0.050-inch-thick which, when tested

temperatures in excess of one hundred and forty (140) degrees Fahrenheit unless
they have been approved for higher temperatures by the Board of Building
Standards.
      (7)    Glass in Projecting Signs. Glass in projecting signs shall be used
only to such extent and in such manner that no hazard shall be created thereby,
and then only if specifically approved by the Designated Building Official.

loads due to wind pressure shall be supported by structural shapes, chains,
cables, or guy rods. Lateral supports shall be spaced not more than eight (8)
feet apart. Turnbuckles or other approved means of adjustment shall be placed
in all chains, cables or rods supporting or bracing projecting signs.
         B.   Method. Complete information regarding the proposed method of
support and attachment of projecting signs shall be submitted with the
application for the permit. No staples or nails shall be used to secure any
projecting sign to any building or other structure. No part of a projecting
sign shall be supported from an unbraced parapet wall.
   (m)   Maintenance and Removal.  All signs shall be maintained in accordance
with the following standards:
      (1)   Responsibility. The property owner, owner of the sign, tenant, and
agent are required to maintain the sign in a condition fit for the intended use
and in good repair, and such person or persons have a continuing obligation to
comply with all Building Code requirements.
      (2)   Condition. A sign in good repair shall be free of peeling or faded
paint, shall not show uneven soiling or rust streaks; shall not have chipped,
cracked, broken or bent letters, panels or framing; shall not otherwise show
deterioration; and shall comply with all other applicable maintenance standards
of the Village.
      (3)   Authority to Require Routine Maintenance. The Designated Building
Official may order any sign to be painted or refurbished at least once a year,
if needed, to keep the sign in a safe and non-blighted condition.
      (4)   Determination as Unsafe Structure. If the sign is deemed by the
Designated Building Official to be not in good repair or in an unsafe
condition, such sign shall be considered an unsafe structure and all Village
regulations applicable for the repair or removal of such sign shall apply.
      (5)   Permit Not Required. Whenever any sign, either conforming or
nonconforming to these regulations, is required to be removed for the purpose
of repair, re-lettering, or repainting, the same may be done without a permit,
or any payment of fees, provided there is no alteration or enlargement to the
structure, mounting, color, or illumination of the sign itself, and the sign is
accessory to a legally permitted or nonconforming use.
      (6)   Removal. Whenever the removal or maintenance of any sign has been
ordered by the Designated Building Official, the person, firm or corporation
who erected such sign or on whose premises such sign or display structure has
been erected, affixed or attached shall remove or maintain such sign within
seventy-two (72) hours after receiving such notice. In the event of
noncompliance, the person, firm or corporation who erected such sign or on
whose premises it was erected, affixed or attached shall be individually and
separately liable for the expense incurred in the removal of such signs.
   (n)   Nonconforming Signs.
      (1)    A sign which is nonconforming on the effective date of this
chapter which does not conform to the regulations of this or a subsequent
amendment, shall be deemed a nonconformity.
      (2)    The purpose of this section, in addition to providing specific
standards for the design, construction and erection of every new graphic, sign,
marquee, canopy and awning is to cause every graphic or other sign in violation
of any provision of this chapter to be removed, altered or replaced so as to
conform to the provisions of this chapter.
      (3)    Authority to Continue Existing Nonconformities. Any permanent
graphic, sign, marquee, canopy or awning, other than a temporary sign, which is
deemed to be a nonconformity, which was erected pursuant to a Village permit
and in place on the effective date of this chapter, and which remains or
becomes a nonconformity upon the adoption of this chapter or any subsequent
amendment thereto, may be continued only in accordance with the following
regulations:
         A.   Repairs. Ordinary repairs and nonstructural alterations may be
made to a nonconforming sign. No structural alterations shall be made in, to or
upon such nonconforming sign, except those required by law to make the sign
conform to the regulations of this chapter.
         B.   Additions and enlargements. A nonconforming sign shall not be
added to or enlarged in any manner, except to make the sign conform to the
regulations of this chapter.
         C.   Moving. No nonconforming sign shall be moved in whole or in part
to any other location unless such sign, and the use thereof, is made to conform
to all regulations of this chapter.
         D.   Restoration of damaged nonconforming signs. A nonconforming sign
which is destroyed or damaged by fire or other cause to the extent that the
cost of restoration will exceed fifty percent (50%) of the original cost of
such sign, shall not be restored unless it is made to conform to all the
regulations of this chapter, or any subsequent amendment thereto. In the event
that such damage or destruction is less than fifty percent (50%) of the
original cost of such sign, no repairs or construction shall be made unless
such restoration is started within six (6) months from the date of the partial
destruction and is diligently pursued to completion.
         E.   Discontinuance of use of nonconforming signs. A nonconforming
sign, the use of which is discontinued for a period of thirty (30) days, shall
thereafter conform to the regulations of this Chapter.
         F.   Change of use of nonconforming signs. Where the business, use or
identity associated with the nonconforming sign at the time of the adoption of
this chapter, thereafter terminates or changes, such termination or change of
use shall require termination of the nonconforming sign, and the use of such
sign shall thereafter conform to the regulations of this section.
         G.   Conformance date. All graphics, signs, marquees, canopies and
awnings rendered nonconforming by the provisions of this chapter and permitted
to continue shall be removed, altered or remodeled to conform to the provisions
of this section.
         H.   When a structure and/or use is nonconforming and the signage
restrictions for the district in which it is located would cause hardship, the
regulations of the district most compatible with the current and/or proposed
use shall be used.
      (4)    Any sign, graphic or numeral display embossed, etched, engraved or
otherwise an integral part of the original building's masonry architecture
which was in existence prior to the effective date of this Code may be
continued provided such sign, graphic or numeral display is maintained as
originally designed and intended.
   (o)   Violations, Penalties and Severability.
      (1)    Responsibility. It shall be the duty of the sign owner, sign
erector, the owner of the business being identified or advertised and/or the
owner of the property upon which the sign is to be placed to see that any sign
erected, altered, modified or maintained is in compliance with all applicable
provisions of these sign regulations and any other conditions specified in the
approval of a sign. Failure to come into compliance after notice as specified
in this section shall be a violation.
      (2)    Correction of Violations. The Designated Building Official shall
declare any violation a nuisance and order in writing the correction of all
conditions which are found to be in violation of these regulations.
         A.   Where the sign regulations provide that a permit or approval of
the Designated Building Official or Planning Commission is required prior to
the erection of the sign, and no permit or approval has been obtained,
violations shall be corrected within seven (7) days after the written order is
issued or the sign in question may be removed by the Village at landowner's
cost.
         B.   Any violation involving temporary signs hereof shall be corrected
within five (5) days after the written order is issued or the sign in question
may be removed by the Village. If the permit holder, sign owner, property owner
or sign provider fails to remove or alter the temporary sign within seven (7)
days after such notice, a such sign or other advertising structure may be
removed or altered by the Village to comply with these regulations at the
expense of the owner of the property upon which it is located. The Designated
Building Official may cause any sign or advertising structure which is in
immediate peril to persons or property or which has been erected for a use
which is not permitted by this Code on the premises, to be removed summarily
and without notice.
         C.   In the case of a sign that poses an immediate danger to the
public health or safety, such a sign shall be removed immediately upon
notification of such pending danger or the sign in question shall be removed by
the Village at the expense of the property owner.
         D.   All other violations shall be corrected within thirty (30) days
after the written order is issued or the sign in question may be removed by the
Village at the expense of the property owner.
         E.   Failure to pay the cost for sign removal hereof, shall result in
a lien upon the premises, which lien shall be filed with the County Recorder's
office to remain a lien of record, until paid. The lien shall accrue interest
at the maximum rate permitted by Ohio law prior to payment. The Designated
Building Official may refuse to issue a permit to any property owner who
refuses to pay costs so assessed.
      (3)    Penalty for Not Correcting Violation:
         A.   Non-residential signs. Any violation not corrected within the
period of time specified in subsection (o)(2) hereof, shall be a misdemeanor
and the sign owner shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00)
and subject to imprisonment for up to thirty (30) days or both, for each day
and every day the violation continued to exist after the period of time to
remove it, specified in subsection (o)(2) above, has expired. A separate
offense shall be deemed committed for each day such violation continues.
         B.   Residential signs. Any violation not corrected within the period
of time specified in subsection (o)(2) hereof for signs regulated in subsection
(j)(2), Residential and Mixed-Density Residential Districts, shall be a minor
misdemeanor and the sign owner shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars
($100.00).
      (4)    Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase
or portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional
by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a
separate, distinct, and independent provision and such holding shall not affect
the validity of the remaining portions hereof.
   (p)   Appeal Procedure. Upon denial of a sign plan application by the
Designated Building Official or Planning Commission, the applicant may appeal
to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Such appeal shall be to request a variance from
the strict application of the provisions of this Chapter. A variance may be
granted upon the affirmative vote of those members present of the Board of
Zoning Appeals finding that strict compliance with the provisions of this
Chapter may impose an undue hardship and that the granting of the variance from
the provisions of this Chapter will not depreciate or damage neighboring
property, will not create a safety hazard and will not be contrary to the
purposes of this Chapter. (Ord. 2017-49. Passed 12-5-17.)

parking spaces located off the streets and in conformity with the requirements
of this
   Code with adequate driveway provisions for ingress thereto and egress
therefrom, and such off-street parking spaces shall thereafter be maintained so
long as the use of the main building or structure remains, unless an equivalent
number of such off-street parking spaces is provided in another permitted
location.

used for the storage or packaging of merchandise (excluding warehouses), not
exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) of the total floor area, may be excluded.
For restaurants and taverns, kitchen space may be excluded from the
calculations.
      (2)   Where seating capacity is the determinant of required parking
spaces, the capacity shall mean the number of seating units installed or
indicated in the application.
      (3)   Where employees are the determinant of required parking spaces,
employees shall mean the maximum number of employees and/or owners on any two
(2) successive shifts.
      (4)   Fractional numbers shall be increased to the next whole number.
      (5)   The parking requirements for mixed uses shall be the sum of the
parking requirements for each use.
 
   (d)   Accessory Use Exemptions. Notwithstanding the accessory use provisions
of this Code, where sufficient area is not available on a lot for providing
required off-street parking spaces therefor, then such off- street parking
spaces may be located within four hundred (400) feet of the main building,
structure or use of such lot on other lots; provided, however, that the
portions of such other lots so to be used shall be owned or leased by the
applicant and satisfactory assurance of his right to continued use of such
premises for such use shall be furnished to support his application for a
building permit.
 
   (e)   Joint Parking Usage and Parking Areas.
      (1)    Two (2) or more non-residential uses may jointly provide and use
parking spaces when their hours of operation do not normally overlap, provided
that a written agreement approved by the Building Commissioner, shall be filed
with the application for a building permit. Where such spaces are provided
collectively, or used jointly, by two (2) or more establishments, the required
spaces may be located not farther than four hundred (400) feet from the
building served. Should any of the uses be changed or the facilities
discontinued, then the required spaces for the use or uses remaining shall be
provided elsewhere as a condition precedent to the continued use of such
building.
      (2)    The portion of the lot occupied by required off-street parking
spaces shall not by conveyance or encumbrance be detached from such lot during
the continuance of the main building, structure or use thereon.
 
   (f)   Driveway Width and Location.
      (1)    Driveway Width. Driveways providing access to off-street parking
spaces, including, but not limited for driveways for residential lots, shall
have a width of not less than ten (10) feet and not more than twelve (12) feet

of not less than eighteen (18) feet and not more than twenty-four (24) feet if
it is a two-way access driveway.
      (2)    Driveway Location. Driveways shall be located and arranged to
minimize traffic congestion, therefore:
         A.   Only one (1) such driveway shall be permitted for each one
hundred (100) feet of frontage of the lot providing such parking spaces.
         B.   No driveway shall be so located that there would be less than
fifteen (15) feet between the driveway apron and the outside crosswalk line at
the intersection when the driveway is on the approach side of the intersection.
         C.   No driveway shall be so located that there would be less than
five (5) feet between the driveway apron and the outside crosswalk line at the
intersection when the driveway is on the leaving side of the intersection.
         D.   No driveway shall be so located that there would be less than
fifty (50) feet between the driveway apron and the closest point of
intersection between a freeway ramp and street pavement.
 
   (g)   Driveway and Parking Construction.
      (1)    All off-street parking spaces, parking lots and driveways,
including, but not limited to residential lots, shall be surfaced with either
concrete or asphalt. All off-street parking spaces, parking lots and driveways
shall comply with applicable storm water management regulations. The grade,
contour and drainage facilities shall be designed to prevent the drainage of
surface water onto neighboring properties, into or toward buildings or onto
sidewalks. Appropriate curbs or bumper guards shall be provided around the
exterior and interior perimeter of the parking area so as to define or limit
the parking facility. The location of each parking space shall be indicated by
paint on the surface of the parking area.
      (2)    The plan for parking spaces of a parking area included with an
application to construct a building or parking area, or for a change in use,
shall be designed and dimensioned in accordance with this section.
 
   (h)   Parking Area Illumination. Except for residential uses, illumination
of off-street parking spaces shall be installed. However, the design and
location of such illumination shall be such that residential uses and public
rights-of-way shall be shielded from any light source, and provided further,
however, that such illumination shall not be of such brightness as to
constitute a safety hazard to users or occupants of such parking spaces or
adjacent premises.
 
   (i)   Commercial Loading Areas.
      (1)    Location. All buildings and structures hereafter constructed for
or converted to use, in whole or in part, for business, commercial or
manufacturing purposes shall be provided with adequate off-street loading or
unloading platforms or space located not less than fifty (50) feet from the
front street line. Any such platforms or space located besides a building,
structure or street shall be so located that a motor vehicle while loading or
unloading will not interfere with the pedestrian or vehicular traffic upon any
access way, parking facility, street or alley.
      (2)    Minimum Size. A required off-street loading space shall be at
least twelve (12) feet in width and of such length as to accommodate a truck
commonly used in conducting the main use. Each loading facility shall have a
vertical clearance of fourteen (14) feet in height.
      (3)    Required Spaces. Accessory off-street loading spaces shall be
provided as required in this subsection for the following uses:
 
Gross Floor Area of Building (sqft)        Required Spaces

1301.01 ADOPTION.
   (a)   There is hereby adopted by and for the Village the Ohio Building Code
(OBC) and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective in 2017, and as identified and
published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC)
   (b)   The Village hereby adopts, on a prospective and rolling basis, any
updates to the Ohio Building Code so that, at all times, the Village shall have
adopted and may utilize and enforce the most recent and then-current form of
the Ohio Building Code, without the need to further amend this Codified
Ordinance. (Ord. 2018-36. Passed 9-18-18.)
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 118 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.
      (OBC 101.3)
1301.03 SCOPE.
   The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and
occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of every building or
structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or
structures. As provided in Section 3791.04(B) of the Ohio Revised Code, no
plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given unless
the building represented by those plans or specifications would, if
constructed, repaired, erected or equipped according to those plans or
specifications, comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code and
any rules adopted by the Board.
   An owner may exceed the requirements of the Ohio Building Code in compliance

to a hearing if requested within thirty days of the mailing of the notice. The
notice shall also inform the party that at the hearing he may be represented by
counsel, present his arguments or contentions orally or in writing and present
evidence and examine witnesses appearing for or against him.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. The Building Official is authorized to serve a
notice of violation or order on the person responsible for the erection,
construction, alteration, extension, repair, moving, removal, demolition or
occupancy of a building or structure. When the Building Official finds that
work or equipment is contrary to approved construction documents and the rules
of the Board of Building Standards, the Building Official shall send a notice
in writing to the owner of said building or the owner’s agent which shall state
where and in what respect the work or equipment does not conform to the
approved plans for same and the rules of the Board. The notice shall specify a
reasonable period of time in which to conform to said plans or the rules of the
Board. Before any work may continue on the construction, erection, alteration,
or equipment of any building for which the approval is invalid, the owner of
the building shall resubmit the plans or drawings and specifications for
approval as required under Section 105.3 of the Ohio Building Code.
   (c)   Prosecution of Violation. Upon the issuance of any order provided for
in this section or Section

provisions of Section 3781.19 of the Ohio Revised Code and all appeals from
such hearing have been completed, or the order has been released.
(OBC 113)
1301.07 STOP WORK ORDER.
   (a)   Authority. Whenever the Building Official finds any work regulated by
this Code being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of this Code
or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the Building Official is authorized to
issue a stop work order whenever the Building Official finds, after inspection,
that the site preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or that the use of an
appliance, materials, assemblage, or manufactured product does not comply with
the provisions of Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code or the rules
adopted pursuant thereto. The effect of such an order shall be limited to the
matter specified in the order.
   (b)   Issuance. The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given
to the owner of the property involved, or to the owner’s agent and the person
doing the work. Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall

(OBC 114)
1301.08 CONFLICT.
   (a)   General. Where, in any specific case, different sections of the Ohio
Building Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other
requirements, the most restrictive shall govern. Where there is a conflict
between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws. The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law. The Municipality,
under Section 3781.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, may make further and additional
regulations, not in conflict with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised
Code or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards. However, under
Section 3781.12 of the Ohio Revised Code, approval by the Board of Building
Standards of any fixture, device, material, system, assembly or product of a
manufacturing process, or method or manner of construction or installation
shall constitute approval for their use anywhere in Ohio. The rules of the
Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order, standard, or
rule of the Division of the Fire Marshal or Industrial Compliance in the
Department of Commerce, and Department of Health and of counties and townships,
in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are in conflict with the
rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that rules adopted and orders

1313.01 ADMINISTRATION GENERALLY.
   For all classes of buildings or parts or appurtenances thereof and all other
structures, whether regulated by the technical provisions of the Housing
Maintenance Code or the Ohio Building Code, the plans submission, procedure and
approval, permit issuance, fees and conditions, enforcement, inspections and
appeals shall be as provided for in the Housing Maintenance Code and Village
ordinances. (Ord. 2018-21. Passed 4-17-18.)
1313.02 CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE REQUIRED; FEE.
   (a)   No person shall use or occupy any parcel of land (except for
agricultural purposes, or existing buildings used exclusively for residential
purposes) or use or occupy a new building, or make an enlargement or
substitution or other change in the use or occupancy of any land or building
until he has applied in writing to the Building Commissioner and received a
certificate of compliance stating that the use or change of use will comply
with the provisions of the Zoning Code and the Building Code.
   (b)   A person may apply to the Commissioner at any time after the
completion of a new building or of an alteration in an existing structure made
in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning and Building Codes for a
certificate of compliance. The Commissioner shall issue such certificate of
compliance to the applicant within five (5) days, excluding Sundays and
holidays, unless he or she finds within that period, after inspection of the
premises, that such use or occupancy would not be permitted by the provisions
of the Zoning and Building Codes. The Commissioner may issue a temporary
certificate for use of a part of a building so complying.
   (c)   The Commissioner shall keep a record of all certificates of
compliance. He/She shall furnish a copy of such certificate or the record
thereof to any person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the land or
building affected. A fee of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be charged for each
certificate of compliance. When the original application for a certificate of
compliance cannot be supplied by the applicant, a fee of ten dollars ($10.00)
shall be charged for a duplicate. Where a certificate of occupancy is required
in addition to a certificate of compliance, the fee for the certificate of
compliance shall be waived upon payment of the fee for the certificate of
occupancy, but such fee waiver does not waive the requirement to obtain a
certificate of occupancy.
   (d)   If the use, occupancy or operation at any time fails to comply with
all Village ordinances or conditions of the building permit, and such failure
to comply continues beyond a time fixed by the Building Commissioner, which
time shall not exceed sixty (60) days from the date of notice of noncompliance,
the certificate of compliance shall become void and all rights thereunder shall
be deemed terminated and the continuance of the use, occupancy or operation
under such certificate shall cease.
   (e)   Notwithstanding the provisions of the Village Zoning Code, a
nonconforming residential building located in a Commercial District may be
rebuilt to the previously-existing size and footprint and used for residential
purposes, and the Building Commissioner may issue applicable building permits
accordingly, even if the building is destroyed to an extent exceeding sixty
percent (60%) of its market value, provided the following conditions are met:
      (1)   No later than thirty (30) days after the event causing damage or
destruction of the building, the owner, mortgagee or other person having a
legal interest in the property provides written proof to the Village of the
existence of insurance or financing adequate to reconstruct/repair the building
and written notice of its intent to so reconstruct/repair the building; and
      (2)   The owner, mortgagee or other person having a legal interest in the
property applies for all necessary building permits or the reconstruction/
repair of the property no later than ninety (90) days after the event causing
damage or destruction of the property; and
      (3)   The reconstruction or repair of the property is substantially
completed within one (1) year of the event causing damage or destruction of the
property. (Ord. 2018-21. Passed 4-17-18.)
1313.03 CALCULATING AGGREGATE FLOOR AREA FOR FEES.
   Where aggregate floor area is the basis for establishing the amount of the
permit fee, such aggregate floor area shall be calculated as follows:
   (a)   The aggregate floor area shall be the sum of gross horizontal areas of
the several floors of the building or other structures, including interior
balconies and mezzanines, if any, and including basements, cellars and usable
parts of attics, except that attic floors in dwelling houses and rooming houses
shall not be included in the aggregate floor area unless they are at least
fifty percent used for habitable rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, toilet rooms or
for other similar living purposes.
   (b)   All horizontal dimensions shall be taken from the exterior faces of
walls, including walls or other enclosures of enclosed porches, dormers,
penthouses and sidewalk vaults, and including the areas of open porches and
open porticos. The measurements shall not include the areas of outer or inner
courts, or the areas of outside terraces or steps, or similar open structures
outside of the enclosing exterior walls.
   (c)   Whenever a story height of a building exceeds fifteen (15) feet
measured as herein specified for "H", the aggregate floor area of such floor
shall be deemed to be H/15 times the measured floor area thereof. "H" shall be
the height measured floor level or such story to the floor level of the story
above, or where such story is the uppermost story of the building and has a
finished ceiling, shall be the height measured from the floor level of such
story to a level one (1) foot above the average ceiling level within the
measured floor area. Where no ceiling is provided in the uppermost story of a
building and the roof is supported on girders or trusses, "H" shall be measured
to the mid-height of such girders or trusses. With a sloping roof and no
ceilings, "H" shall be measured to the mid-height of the sloping roof. With
exposed roof joists on bearing walls "H" shall be measured to a level one (1)
foot above the average level of the roof joists.
      (Ord. 2018-21. Passed 4-17-18.)
1313.04 CONSTRUCTION DEPOSITS.
   Before proceeding with any construction, alteration or repair, the owner or
agent shall deposit with the Village such sum not exceeding one thousand
dollars ($1,000) as may be required by the Building Commissioner. Such deposit
shall be a guarantee for repair of any damage done to public or private
property and/or of cleaning required to be done to public or private property
by reason of such construction operation which shall not immediately be
remedied by the owner or his agent. The Village shall have the right, without
notice to the owner or his agent to repair such damage or to do any cleaning
and reimburse itself from such deposit for all expenses so incurred. In such
event, the owner or agent shall upon demand immediately reimburse the deposit
fund to bring it up to its full original amount. If the owner or agent fails to
make such reimbursement, the Building Commissioner may issue any order stopping
all work on the project until reimbursement is made. After construction work
has been completed and any necessary repairs or cleaning are completed to the
satisfaction of the Building Commissioner, the deposit shall be refunded. This
section does not preclude the Village from prosecuting a civil action against
the owner or agent or the person causing the damage to public property or
against the owner or agent or the person creating the necessity for cleaning
public property if the cost of repairing the damage and/or cleaning is more
than the amount of the construction deposit.

intent to obtain a permit, and no additional surcharge shall be imposed after
the date of such filing so long as all work has been stopped and the
construction site left in a safe and secure state as set forth in any notice
issued by the Building Commissioner or his/her authorized agent. The imposition
of a permit fee surcharge shall not preclude the Solicitor, Building
Commissioner, or other appropriate Village official from instituting an action
or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction for penalties as set forth

1313.09 PERMIT FEES GENERALLY.
   The general schedule of permit fees for each of the following categories of
construction shall be as follows:
   (a)   Any construction, additions, alteration, renovation, repair,
refurbishment and/or restoration of commercial buildings as defined in the Ohio
Building Code: shall require a permit fee equal to one percent (1%) of the
actual costs of the project.
   Permit fees shall be paid as follows:
   For issuance of any given permit, the owner or contractor shall pay a
deposit amount equal to one percent (1%) of the estimated costs of the project.
It shall be the obligation of the owner or his agent to furnish estimates as
will enable the Building Official to determine the current cost value. Where
such estimates are incomplete or inconclusive, the Building Official may
require the owner or his agent to furnish an estimate by a professional
individual or organization satisfactory to the Building Official.
   Upon completion of the project, the actual costs of the project shall be
reconciled against the amount deposited by the owner or contractor, as
applicable, as a permit fee. To the extent the actual costs of the project,
including costs associated with any change orders, exceed the amount deposited,
the owner or contractor shall pay one percent (1%) of such difference. To the
extent the actual costs of the project, including costs associated with any
change orders, are less than the amount deposited, the Village will refund one
percent (1%) of such difference.
   The minimum permit fee is $100.00.
   The Village reserves the right to require the deposit of additional amounts
as permit fee after the commencement of construction if, during the course of
construction, it becomes apparent that one percent (1%) of actual costs exceed
the amount deposited or that the estimated costs are underestimated. Failure by
the owner or contractor to comply with the Village's demand for an additional
deposit will result in the issuance of a stop work order by the Village, which
shall cause any issued permits to be void and of no effect.
   (b)   New construction of residential 1, 2 and 3 family structures and
additions to such structures.

prior to the date of such sale or transfer of title, the purchaser or
transferee of said property shall apply to the Building Commissioner for a
certificate of inspection within thirty days after the time of transfer of
title to the purchaser or transferee. The failure of the purchaser or
transferee to obtain and/or file a deed with the County Recorder shall not
excuse the purchaser or transferee from compliance with this chapter. The
purchaser or transferee shall further comply with all of the obligations of a
seller under this chapter including, without limitation, the duty to place
funds in escrow for corrections of Class "A" violations.
   (c)   Any owner of residential property required by subsections (a) and/or
(b) hereof to obtain a Certificate of Inspection from the Building Commissioner
may refuse entry onto their property and/or into any residential improvements,
structures, home, apartment, outbuilding or other building. Upon such refusal,
the Village shall be obligated to either (i) issue a Certificate of Inspection
based solely on the Village's curbside inspection or (ii) seek an
administrative search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction to conduct
an inspection of the property. Once an administrative search warrant is issued,
the Village shall promptly perform its inspection and issue a Certificate of
Inspection pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance. In the event that the
Village's petition for an administrative search warrant is denied, the Village
shall be obligated to issue a Certificate of Inspection based solely on the
Village's curbside inspection of the property.
   (d)   If all Class A violations listed on a Certificate of Inspection are
not corrected prior to any transfer of title, an escrow account must be
established and funds, in an amount equal to the greater of five hundred
dollars ($500.00) or the amount that is one hundred twenty percent (120%) of
the estimated cost of repairs, must be deposited to pay to correct all
violations. The amount to be deposited in escrow shall be determined by the
Building Commissioner, provided that the Building Commissioner shall take into
account the amount of any signed contract with any contractor registered to do
business in the Village.
   (e)   A Certificate of Inspection issued by the Village hereunder shall be
valid for a period of one (1) year from the date of issuance the Certificate of
Inspection.
(Ord. 2020-39. Passed 11-17-20.)
1329.02 APPLICATION AND ISSUANCE.
   (a)   Application for a certificate of inspection required by the provisions
of this chapter shall be made by the owner, or an agent for the owner, upon
forms provided by the Building Commissioner. The Commissioner shall inform the
applicant that he/she has a constitutional right to refuse entry by Village
inspectors without a search warrant.
   If the applicant shall consent to the inspection, the parties shall then
agree to a time during the working hours of the Building Department, or at some
other mutually agreeable time when the inspection is to be made.
   If the applicant refuses to consent to the inspection, the Building
Commissioner shall procure a search warrant as provided by law to gain entry.
   (b)   The following schedule for issuing a certificate of inspection shall
be followed, except where a longer period is required because of the larger
number of units in a building or other causes beyond the control of the
Village:
      (1)   Within ten (10) working days after receipt of the application and
required fee, the Building Commissioner shall cause an inspection of the
designated property to be made.

certificate of inspection shall contain the order of the Building Commissioner
for the correction of any Code violations noted on the certificate, which shall
be corrected by the owner of the property within ninety (90) days of the
issuance of the certificate unless, for good cause shown, the Building
Commissioner has extended that time for compliance. If the owner of a property
does not comply with the violations enumerated in the certificate of inspection
prior to the time the title is transferred to the purchaser, then the purchaser
of that property shall be required to comply with the violations contained in
the certificates of inspection within the time allotted in the notice given to
the prior owner as that time may be extended by the Building Commissioner.
   (d)    Such certificate of inspection shall be valid for a period of one (1)

Building Commissioner stating that violations listed on a specific certificate
of inspection have been completed to the Village's satisfaction, when, in fact,
all such violations have been corrected.
   (b)    At the request of the owner of property or his agent, the Village may

owner within one (1) year from the date of issuance of a certificate of
inspection for the same property.

without first providing the purchaser or prospective purchaser with a current
certificate of inspection or an exact copy thereof as provided in this chapter.

purchaser acknowledging receipt of the certificate of inspection, and such
signed statement shall list thereon the date the certificate was given to the
purchaser.

to correct all violations listed on the certificate of inspection, the seller
shall deposit in escrow before transfer of title to the purchaser either a
compliance document described in Section
1329.03 and/or a written statement agreed upon by the seller and the purchaser
filed with the escrow agent setting forth an agreed sum of money that is
sufficient to cover the costs of correcting those specific violations listed on
the certificate of inspection which remain uncorrected.
   (d)    If, under the terms of the contract of sale, the purchaser's
obligation for correction of violations listed on the certificate of inspection
is limited to contribution of a specifically stated dollar amount, or is
limited to purchaser's obligation to correct specific, but not all, Code
violations, then the seller shall deposit in escrow either a compliance
document described in Section
1329.03(a), if, in fact, all such violations have been corrected, or a
compliance document described in Section
1329.03(b), together with a written statement agreed upon by seller and
purchaser filed with the escrow agent setting forth an agreed sum of money that
is sufficient to cover the costs of correcting the violations listed on the
certificate of inspection which remain uncorrected and for which the seller is

agreed to correct all violations as provided in subsection (c) hereof, or the
purchaser's obligation is not limited to payment of a stated sum of money or to
correction of specific violations as provided in subsection (d) hereof, then
the contract of sale between the seller and the purchaser shall be conditional
upon the seller and purchaser agreeing in writing after the certificate of
inspection has been exhibited to the purchaser, as to their respective
obligations for correction of the remaining uncorrected violations listed on
such certificate. The seller and purchaser shall thereafter deposit in escrow,

party's respective responsibility for correction of violations listed on the
certificate of inspection remaining uncorrected, and such agreement may have
attached thereto a compliance document described in Section
1329.03(b) evidencing seller's correction of those violations for which he is

of correcting those violations remaining uncorrected for which the seller is
responsible.
   (f)    This chapter sets forth requirements and procedures applicable to
relationships between the seller and purchaser at the time of sale of real
estate, as to Code violations. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be
construed as limiting the Village, at any time, from proceeding against the
owner of property to require correction of Code violations, as the owner of
property is defined in the Codified Ordinances.
   (g)    This chapter shall not apply to the individual transfer of property
through inheritance or gift where no bona fide sale is intended or completed.

requirements in order to make the sale and repair of the property financially
practicable; and
      (2)    The purchaser has the financial capability to correct the
violations listed on the Village Certificate of Inspection within a reasonable
period of time; and
      (3)    The variance is in the best interest of the Village and its
residents.
         (Ord. 2014-21. Passed 4-15-14.)
1329.06 ESCROW AGENT OBLIGATIONS.
   No person, firm or corporation acting in the capacity of an escrow agent in
any real estate transaction involving the bona fide sale or conveyance of any
interest in a dwelling structure, commercial building structure or other

insure, warrant or guarantee to the holder thereof, to his assignees or any
other interested party that such certificate contains all of the violations of
the Codified Ordinances of the Village or statutes of the State. Such
certificate should be considered by all parties as the Village's best effort to
make known to owners and purchasers of real estate the known violations on a
given property at the time the inspection is made. A copy of this section, or a
digest thereof, shall be contained in each certificate of inspection.
   (b)    In issuing a compliance document under the provisions of this
chapter, the Village does not thereby insure, warrant or guarantee the quality

1333.01 PUBLIC NUISANCE BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES; REPAIR OR DEMOLITION THEREOF.
   (a)   Public Nuisance Structures Defined. For purposes of this Building
Code, “public nuisance structures” are hereby defined as those buildings or
structures that are any of the following:
      (1)   Injurious to or a menace to the public health, safety or welfare;
      (2)   Structurally unsafe, unsanitary or not provided with adequate safe
egress;
      (3)   A fire hazard;
      (4)   Vacant and open to public entry;
      (5)   Otherwise dangerous to human life or injurious to the public; or
      (6)   In relation to existing use, a hazard to the public health, safety
or welfare by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence or
abandonment.
   (b)   Unsafe Structures.  
      (1)   For purposes of this Building Code, those buildings or structures
that meet the definition of public nuisance structures are declared to be
“unsafe structures” as well.
      (2)   All unsafe structures or conditions as defined in other parts of
the code are likewise declared to be public nuisance structures under this code
section.
   (c)   Per Se Public Nuisance Structures. Vacant and unsafe structures in
which utility services have not been shut off are declared to be a public
nuisance because of the risk of harm from explosion, accidental fire or
flooding.
   (d)   Landscaping. The existence of overgrown grass, weeds, or other
landscaping conditions that violate the provisions of the Codified Ordinances
shall be considered a nuisance, and if such conditions are found to exist only
one (1) notice to the property owner, as provided in this chapter, shall be
necessary in any one growing season and the Building Commissioner may cause
such nuisance to be abated or removed more than once in any growing season as
conditions may require.
   (e)   Tree Roots. The existence of tree roots that obstruct sewers shall be
considered a nuisance, and if such condition is found, the Building
Commissioner may abate the nuisance immediately and without service of notice
or estimate of the cost of abatement.
   (f)   Costs. If the Building Commissioner takes action to abate any nuisance
described in subsections (d) and (e) hereof, the Commissioner shall furnish the
owner of the real estate from which the nuisance originates with a statement of
the cost of abating the same as soon as the cost can be ascertained, and shall
order the owner to pay the cost within such reasonable time as the Commissioner
shall fix, but not less than thirty (30) days. In case the cost is not paid
within the time fixed, the Commissioner shall collect such costs as set forth
in this chapter.
(Ord. 2012-35. Passed 6-5-12.)
1333.02 DECLARATION OF PUBLIC NUISANCE; REPAIR OR DEMOLITION OR DEMOLITION OF
UNSAFE STRUCTURES AND EXTERIOR PROPERTY NUISANCES; VIOLATIONS AND REMEDIAL
NOTICES; APPEALS PROCESS; COST RECOVERY.
   (a)   Declaration of Public Nuisance. All public nuisance structures are
declared to be public nuisances. The public nuisance shall be abated by
correction of the violations to the minimum standards of the Codified
Ordinances of the Village of Newburgh Heights, Ohio, the Revised Code, and the
Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio Fire Code, or by demolition.
   (b)   Examination and Condemnation.
      (1)   The Building Commissioner or his or her designee (for the purposes
of this section, the “Commissioner”) is authorized to examine or cause to be
examined every building or other structure reported to be unsafe or damaged or
injurious to or a menace to the public, and shall make a written record of the
examination.
      (2)   The Commissioner may designate as a public nuisance structure any
structures or conditions, or any portion thereof, found to be unsafe under the
criteria established in Section
1333.01.
      (3)   The Commissioner may also declare that a public nuisance structure
which, due to its advanced state of dilapidation, substantial fire damage or
structure infirmity, is an immediate hazard to human life or health, may only
be abated by immediate repair and rehabilitation to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Newburgh Heights, Ohio, the Revised
Code, and Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio Fire Code, or by
demolition.
      (4)   Whenever the Commissioner finds a vacant structure open to entry at
doors, windows or other points accessible to the general public, the
Commissioner may cause the structure to be secured at those points of entry.
The Commissioner shall be authorized at any time to enter the premises to
secure the structure in order to lessen the severity of the public nuisance. In
securing the structure, the Commissioner may call any department of the Village
for whatever assistance may be necessary, or may, by private contract, secure
such structure, and may notify any public utility to shut off service to the
property.
   (c)   Notice of Violation.
      (1)   Whenever the Commissioner finds a building, structure or a portion
thereof to be unsafe, and determines it or the property on which it is located
to be a public nuisance structure, the Commissioner shall forward by certified
mail to the owner, agent or person in control of the public nuisance structure
and to any mortgagee of record a written notice of violation stating the
defects in the building or structure. The notice of violation shall require the
owner to abate the nuisance condition of the public nuisance structure by
correction of the violations and defects to the minimum standards of the
Codified Ordinances of the Village of Newburgh Heights, Ohio, the Revised Code
and the Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio Fire Code, or by
demolition and removal of the public nuisance structure or a portion thereof
within a stated time. The notice also shall state that if the nuisance is not
abated within the required time, the Commissioner may take appropriate action
to repair, remove or otherwise abate the public nuisance structure, and that
the owner, agent or person in control shall be responsible for the costs. The
handling of the violation notice to the owner, agent or person in control of
the public nuisance structure or a portion thereof shall be deemed actual
notice, and is legal and valid service, and no other form of service is
necessary.
      (2)   If the person to whom the notice and order is addressed is not
found after a reasonable and diligent search, then the notice and order shall
be sent by certified mail to his tax mailing address, if available, as
indicated on the County tax duplicate, and a copy of the notice shall be posted
in a conspicuous place on the premises to which it related. The mailing and
posting shall be deemed legal service of the notice.
      (3)   An owner, agent or person in control of the public nuisance
structure, a mortgagee of record, or a lien-holder of record who has received a
notice of violation or a notice to make corrections to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Newburgh Heights, Ohio, the Revised
Code and the Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio Fire Code, or to
demolish and remove, as provided for in this section, shall inform prospective
purchasers, vendees, grantees, assignees, lessees, or land contractees of the
notice of violation or the notice to make corrections, or to demolish and
remove. No person shall transfer to a vendee, grantee, assignee, lessee, land
contractee or any other transferee any interest in a public nuisance structure
after receiving a notice of violation to make corrections, or to demolish and
remove the same, without first providing the transferee with a copy of the
notice.
      (4)   No person, agent, firm or corporation shall sell, by land contract
or otherwise, any interest in any public nuisance structure without furnishing
the buyer, prior to the sale, a copy of any outstanding notice or order from
the Village, including any notice of violation or any outstanding notice to
make corrections to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of the
Village of Newburgh Heights, Ohio, the Revised Code and the Ohio Administrative
Code, including the Ohio Fire Code, or any outstanding notice to demolish and
remove. No buyer or grantee, by land contract or otherwise, shall obtain any
interest in any public nuisance structure without obtaining from the seller,
prior to sale, the documents described above.
      (5)   No person, agent, firm or corporation acting in the capacity of an
escrow agent in any real estate transaction involving the sale of a public
nuisance structure in the Village, shall disburse any funds unless the
provisions of this section have been met.
      (6)   Any buyer or grantee, by land contract or otherwise, of a public
nuisance structure, shall begin at the date of transfer to comply with any no
tice or order obtained or to be obtained under this paragraph and, within ten
(10) days of the date of transfer, shall notify the Commissioner, in writing,
of the actions that will be taken to comply. The Commissioner may then
establish a reasonable time to comply.
   (d)   Vacating Buildings and Prohibiting Use. The Commissioner may also
require in the notice issued under subsection (c)(1) of this section that the
public nuisance structure or a portion thereof be vacated, not to be
reoccupied, or used until the specified repairs and improvements are completed,
inspected and approved by the Commissioner.
   The Commissioner may cause to be posted at each entrance to the public
nuisance structure a notice as follows:
“THIS STRUCTURE IS IN A DANGEROUS CONDITION AND HAS BEEN CONDEMNED AND ITS USE
HAS BEEN PROHIBITED BY THE BUILDING COMMISSIONER”.
(Ord. 2012-35. Passed 6-5-12.)
   (e)   Right to Appeal.
      (1)   Board of Building Standards and Building Appeals.
         A.   The owner, agent or person in control of a public nuisance
structure shall have a right to appeal to the Board of Building and Zoning
Appeals from the notice and decision of the Commissioner as provided in this
section within twenty (20) days of the service of the Commissioner’s notice.
(Ord. 2016-01. Passed 2-2-16.)
         B.   The Board of Building and Zoning Appeals shall hold and conduct a
public hearing within twenty (20) days of the receipt of the notice of appeal.
         C.   In any such appeal, the Village must show by preponderance of the
evidence the existence of the condition or defects that are noted in the
Commissioner’s notice.
         D.   The Board of Building and Zoning Appeals, upon hearing all the
facts and evidence, shall make a determination as to whether the Village has
met its burden to show the existence of the condition or defects in the
Commissioner’s notice.
         E.   If the Board of Building and Zoning Appeals makes a determination
that the Village has met its burden, then the decision of the Board shall
become a final order.
         F.   The Board shall publish its decision and serve notice by
certified mail to the owner, agent or person in control of the public nuisance
structure or portion thereof and to any mortgagee of record.
         G.   Any notice served by the Commissioner shall automatically become
a final order if a written notice of appeal before the Board is not filed in
the office of the Board within the time set forth above.
      (2)   Appeal to court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any
provisions contained herein, the owner or person in control of the structure
shall have the right to appeal the decision and order of the Board to a court
of competent jurisdiction. In the absence of an appeal, all actions taken shall
constitute a valid exercise of the police powers of the Village of Newburgh
Heights.
   (f)   Noncompliance with Notice.
      (1)   Commissioner authorized to abate, demolish, remove. In case the
owner, agent or person in control fails, neglects or refuses to comply with the
notice to repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove a public nuisance
structure or a portion thereof, the Commissioner may take appropriate action to
abate, demolish or remove the public nuisance structure or portion thereof or
to abate or remove any condition constituting the nuisance.
      (2)   Action by Solicitor. The Commissioner may advise the Solicitor of
the facts in the case, who may institute appropriate action in court to cause
correction of the violations and defects, or demolition and removal, or
effective boarding of the building or structure pending rehabilitation.
      (3)   Rehabilitation permits not a bar to Commissioner’s action to abate.
The securing of rehabilitation permits for the building or structure shall not
in and of itself bar the Commissioner from taking action to abate the nuisance.
      (4)   Failure to comply with notice. In case the owner, agent or person
in control fails, neglects or refuses to comply with the notice to repair or
rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove a public nuisance structure or a
portion thereof, or to remove or abate any other condition that is defined as a
nuisance under this section, the Commissioner may take appropriate action to
take repair or maintenance measures or cause utility services to be shut off or
to otherwise abate the public nuisance. The Commissioner shall specifically
state in writing the findings with respect to the public nuisance structure,
and shall determine whether to perform repair or maintenance based on factors
which may include the following: the distance of the structure from neighboring
structures, the type of structure, the extent of deterioration, the likelihood
of vandalism or arson, the economic likelihood of eventual complete
rehabilitation of the structure, and the cost of repair or maintenance.
      (5)   Notice of intent to demolish. The Commissioner shall give written
notice informing the owner, agent or person in control of the public nuisance
structure or a portion thereof, as well as any mortgagee and lienholder of
record, of the Village’s intention to demolish and remove the unsafe building
or structure at least thirty (30) days before the intended action by the
Village. The notice may be effective concurrently with the violation notice.
   (g)   Costs.
      (1)   Any and all expenses or costs incurred under this section for the

of this chapter if it has not been occupied for a period of six (6) consecutive
months or more, except a structure shall not be considered vacant if it is only
seasonally not occupied and such period is less than twelve (12) months. A
structure shall be considered “vacant” for the purpose of this chapter even if
it is being maintained on the exterior, and even if the owner of the property
is actively attempting to sell or rent the property.
      (2)   “Abandoned”: An “abandoned” structure is a structure that is not
occupied for any period of time during which the Village has not been able to
communicate with or located an owner or party with the legal authority to be in
control of the property, and after the Village has made reasonable attempts to
communicate with or locate the owner or a party in control.
      (3)   “Occupied”: “Occupied” shall mean the presence of a person or
persons either:
         A.   Living in a structure and using some portion of such structure as

in this section. The exterior of a vacant or abandoned structure, including the
property and structure, shall be maintained in compliance with all applicable
ordinances of the Village, and the interior shall be maintained in a safe,
secure and preserved manner to prevent and abate any threat to the health or
safety of the public or anyone entering the structure, and to prevent and abate
any threat of fire or health violation, or to its structural or historical
integrity. The structure shall be winterized to prevent freezing of pipes, and
all points of entry shall be kept locked and secure. Sufficient property and
liability insurance shall be maintained covering the property up to an amount
at least equal to the fair market value of the property. The Village shall
provide the insurance carrier, if known, and any lien holder of record for the
property a written notice of the requirements of this section and that the
property is considered vacant or abandoned property in violation of this
section or any other ordinance applicable to the property or structure to
provide proof of insurance, and no owner or agent shall fail to provide such
proof when so ordered.
   (c)   The Commissioner may take any action necessary to inspect a vacant or
abandoned property, and to abate a vacant or abandoned property nuisance, as
authorized in this chapter. Upon inspection of a vacant or abandoned structure,
the Commissioner may take any action authorized by law to ensure that the
property, including the structure, is maintained according to the requirements
of all applicable ordinances.
   (d)   No insurance company doing business in the Village shall pay a claim
of any named insured, including any lien holder, for damage to a vacant or
abandoned structure, other than fire damage, unless and until the carrier
follows the procedures in this section. The carrier shall request from the
Village an affidavit signed by the Commissioner that states whether the Village
has any unpaid costs or whether any abatement orders have been issued
containing an estimated cost of work associated with the abatement of any
existing nuisance condition, as defined in this chapter, at the insured
property. The Village shall provide an affidavit in response to the request of
a insurance carrier within thirty (30) days of receiving a request. If the
affidavit states that the Village has no unpaid costs or outstanding abatement
orders, the carrier may pay the claim. If the affidavit states that there are
unpaid costs, the insurance carrier shall pay to the Village such costs or the
full amount of the claim owed to the insured, whichever is less. If the
affidavit states that there is an outstanding abatement order, the insurer
shall pay into an escrow fund established for the purpose of this section the
amount of the estimated cost of abatement or the full amount owed to the
insured, whichever is less. Funds shall be disbursed from the escrow to the
Village upon the presentation of an invoice showing the amount incurred by the
Village to abate the nuisance. Funds shall be disbursed to the insured only
upon the written authorization of the Clerk-Treasurer, which shall be provided
after the Village is provided proof that the nuisance has been abated, or that
an amount equal to the amount in escrow has been expended in the performance of
work to abate the nuisance on the property.

1339.16 SOUND AND VIBRATION BARRIER.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect the public health,
safety and welfare by requiring a sound and vibration barrier along private
roads where such roads are in close proximity to residential property and where
such roads experience heavy truck traffic.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   "Entering or exiting the industrial complex" means that each truck
shall be counted both as it enters and as it exits for purposes of determining
when the industrial complex is experiencing heavy truck traffic.
      (2)   "Fifty or more in number per day" means fifty or more trucks each
day, averaged over the five day work week. Thus, to total the number of trucks
entering and exiting an industrial complex, one would count each truck that
enters, each truck that exits and tally this number for an entire seven day
week. This total is then divided by five to obtain the average amount of truck
traffic over a five day work week.
      (3)   "Heavy truck traffic" means trucks of fifty or more in number per
day, either entering or exiting the industrial complex.
      (4)   "Industrial complex" means any building or buildings, either
existing, or under development or construction, in areas designated in the
Zoning Ordinance of the Village as Industrial, Semi-Industrial or Commercial
Use Districts.
      (5)   "Owner" or "operator" means any individual, corporation,
partnership, receiver, assignee, firm, co-partnership, joint venture, company,
joint stock company, association, municipality, society or any group of
individuals acting as a unit, whether mutual, cooperative, fraternal, non-
profit or otherwise, which owns or operates a building or buildings in an area
designated as an Industrial, Commercial or Semi-Industrial Use District in the
Zoning Ordinance of the Village, or which owns or operates property in an area
designated as an Industrial, Commercial or Semi-Industrial Use District.
      (6)   "Sound and vibration barrier" means a barrier or fence constructed
so as to reduce traffic noise levels to a maximum exterior level of sixty-seven
decibels (dBA) leq(h) or seventy decibels (dBA) L10(h) and a maximum interior
level of fifty-two decibels (dBA) leq(h) or fifty-five decibels (dBA) L10(h),
as defined in Regulations Governing the Federal Highway Administration, 23
C.F.R. Section 772.5 and Table 1. Measurement of traffic noise levels to
determine compliance with this section shall be by any method consistent with
Federal Procedures for Abatement of Highway Traffic Noise and Construction, 23
C. F. R. Section 772.1-19, and the Department of Transportation's Report titled
"Sound Procedures for Measuring Highway Noise", Report No. FHWA-DP-45-IR.
      (7)   "Truck" means any commercial vehicle with two or more axles and six
or more wheels, or weighing more than 11,000 pounds.
   (c)   Imposition of Sound and Vibration Barrier.
      (1)   There is hereby imposed a requirement that owners or operators of
industrial complexes in the Village construct a sound and vibration barrier
along any private roads in the industrial complex experiencing heavy truck
traffic.
      (2)   This section shall apply to private roads in industrial complexes
where such roads are within 500 feet of residential property.
      (3)   All owners or operators of industrial complexes must obtain
approval of the Building Commissioner prior to beginning construction of a
sound and vibration barrier.
      (4)   Sound and vibration barriers shall be constructed in an
aesthetically pleasing manner and shall be properly maintained by the owner or
operator.
   (d)   Enforcement and Penalties. Regardless of the penalties provided in
Section 501.99(a) of the Codified Ordinances, whoever violates any provision of
this section, whether as an owner or operator, shall be subject to a civil
penalty of at least two thousand dollars ($2,000), but not more than five
thousand dollars ($5,000) for each violation. Each day of violation constitutes
a separate offense.
   (e)   Effective Date. This section shall take effect and be in force at the
earliest possible date allowed by law.
(Ord. 1989-20. Passed 10-17-89.)
1339.99 PENALTY.
   Except as where otherwise provided whoever violates any of the provisions of
this chapter shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof
shall be fined an amount not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). Each day
such violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a
separate offense and shall be punishable as such hereunder.

County, Ohio, or must actually reside within Cuyahoga County, Ohio. An owner
who is a natural person and who meets the requirements of this subsection as to
location of residence or office may designate himself as agent. By designating
an authorized agent under the provisions of this Section
1351.07, the owner is consenting to receive any and all notices of violations

administrative enforcement proceeding related to the use or maintenance of the
property or dwelling structure, including but not limited to proceedings

footage of the structure or floor area to the occupied space, the condition and
value of any items in the structure and the presence of rental or for sale
signs on the property; provided that a dwelling structure shall not be deemed
vacant if it has been used as a residence by a person entitled to possession

of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable by up to six months in jail
and up to a one thousand dollar ($1,000) fine. Each and every day in violation

1353.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the Village a number of
rental properties which are or may become in the future, substandard with
respect to structure, equipment or maintenance; or further that such conditions
including but not limited to structural deterioration, lack of maintenance and
appearance of the exterior of such buildings, infestation, existence of fire
hazards, unsanitary conditions and overcrowding constitute a menace to the
peace, health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Village. It is
further found and declared that by reason of lack of maintenance and because of
progressive deterioration, certain properties have the further effect of
creating blighting conditions; and if the same are not curtailed and removed,
such conditions will grow and spread.

prior to both the commencement of any tenancy and/or the expiration of any
Rental Permit and Certificate of Occupancy (a "Rental Permit"), obtain a Rental
Permit from the Village Building Department. The Village will issue a Rental
Permit upon compliance with the rental registration and inspection process
hereafter set forth.
   (b)    Prior to issuance by the Village Building Department of a Rental
Permit in connection with a property that is not registered in the Village of
Newburgh Heights or issuance of any renewal of a Rental Permit, the owner or
agent of the property is required to do the following:
      (1)    Submit a completed application on forms provided by the Building
Commissioner;
      (2)    Submit the required registration and inspection fee of $150.00 for
each and every unit in a Rental Dwelling;
      (3)    Submit proof of homeowners insurance from a reputable insurance
company insuring the subject Rental Dwelling in an amount not less than its
full replacement value;

rental inspection, any noted violations regarding life safety or sanitary
conditions will be assigned a compliance date and must be corrected and
approved or re-inspected prior to the issuance of the Rental Permit. If no
violations or minor violations are noted from the inspection, a Rental Permit
will be issued provided the other requirements of this ordinance are met. If
there are minor violations noted from the inspection, a violation notice will
be issued with assigned compliance dates for correction of violations. If the
owner or agent does not consent to an inspection and a court of competent
jurisdiction finds no probable cause to issue an administrative search warrant,
the subject property will be deemed to have passed the inspection with no
violations.
   (c)    Each Rental Permit or renewal shall expire at the end of December
31st of the year following the year in which the Rental Permit or renewal
thereof was issued.
   (d)    Any renewal of a Rental Permit that is obtained on or before March
31st of the year in which renewal is required shall be deemed to be effective
as of January 1st of that year. Any renewal of a Rental Permit obtained after

1355.02 NOTICE AND ORDER SERVED; ASSESSMENT OF COSTS.
   The Chief of Police, or his designee, upon finding that two or more nuisance
activities declared in this section have occurred within any twelve month
period, may cause a written notice and order to be served on the owner of the
property declaring that such property is a nuisance property. The notice and
order shall set forth the nature of the nuisances, the estimated costs to abate
any future nuisance, and state the steps to prevent any further nuisance
activity as set forth in this section. The notice shall further state that if a
third or subsequent nuisance activity as declared in this section occurs within
twelve months of the dates of the first two activities, the Village may abate
the nuisance by responding to the activities using administrative and law
enforcement actions, and the costs of such abatement shall be assessed on the
nuisance property. Notice shall be served as set forth in Chapter
1333.
(Ord. 2007-27. Passed 9-18-07.)
1355.03 ABATEMENT PROCEDURES.
   If within twelve months after the first of the two nuisances referred to in
Section
1355.02  has occurred, a third nuisance activity as declared in this section
occurs, the Village may abate the nuisance by responding to the activity using
administrative and law enforcement actions, and the costs of such abatement
shall be assessed on the nuisance property in the same manner as in Chapter
1333 , and the costs calculated as set forth in Section
1355.05 . The Village shall provide notice to the owner of the nuisance
property of the Village’s intent to assess the costs of abatement against the
owner’s property at least thirty (30) days before such costs are certified to
the County for assessment against the property, and such notice shall contain a
description of the nuisance activity that is the basis for the notice of intent
to assess the property, and the cost to abate. Notice shall be served as set
forth in Chapter
1333 .
(Ord. 2007-27. Passed 9-18-07.)
1355.04 APPEAL; HEARING.
   The owner of a nuisance property who receives a notice from the Chief of
Police, or his designee, pursuant to this section may appeal such notice by
submitting a written request for reconsideration to the Chief of Police within
thirty (30) days of the date of the notice. If the Chief of Police finds that
the facts presented do not support the declaration of a nuisance, the Chief
shall rescind the notice. Otherwise, the Chief shall deny the request and refer
the appeal for hearing by the Zoning and Building Appeals Board. Any such
appeal shall not stay any actions by the Village to abate the first or any
subsequent nuisance activity. In any such appeal, the Village must show by a
preponderance of the evidence that each violation stated in the notice being
appealed has occurred, and that the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property or of the intent of the Village to assess the property for abatement
costs, whichever is applicable, is justified. The Village shall be deemed to
have failed to have met this standard if the owner demonstrates by a
preponderance of evidence that:
   (a)   He or she was not the owner at the time of any nuisance activity that
is the basis of the notice; or
   (b)   He or she had knowledge of the nuisance activity, but has promptly and
vigorously taken all actions necessary to abate each nuisance including,
without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio Revised Code
Sections 5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9), or
   (c)   He or she had no knowledge of the nuisance activity and could not,
with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance activity; and
upon receipt of the notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance
property, he or she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance
including, without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Ohio Revised
Code Sections 5321.17(C) and 5321.04(A)(9). (Ord. 2007-27. Passed 9-18-07.)
1355.05 ASSESSMENT OF COSTS.
   Costs of abatement shall be assessed based upon the hourly wage of the
police officer or officers involved in the abatement of the nuisance activity,
plus 75%, multiplied by the number of hours required to abate the nuisance.
(Ord. 2007-27. Passed 9-18-07.)
1355.06 VIOLATIONS; AUTHORITY TO BRING LEGAL ACTION.
   The declaration of a nuisance property, an order to abate a nuisance, or the
assessment of costs by the Village on a property, do not affect or limit the
Village’s right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal
action against any person for violation of the Village’s ordinances. (Ord.
2007-27. Passed 9-18-07.)
1355.07 IDENTIFICATION OF HIGH CRIME AREAS.
   (a)   In the event of the occurrence of several instances of violent of
dangerous crime on any given street or in any given area (such as a public
park), as determined in the discretion of the Village Chief of Police, Safety
Director and Council, collectively, in a period of twelve (12) months, the
Village shall designate such street or area, as applicable, as a High Crime
Area.
   (b)   In order for any area within the Village to be designated as a High
Crime Area under this section, the following shall occur.
      (1)    The Chief of Police, in the Chief's sole discretion, shall
recommend the designation of a High Crime Area by preparing a report making
such recommendation and providing that report to the Village's Safety Director.
      (2)    Upon receipt of a report recommending that an area in the Village
be designated as a High Crime Area, the Safety Director shall promptly review
said report and shall, in the Safety Director's sole discretion, either (i)
recommend to Council that the Chief's recommendation be accepted and a High
Crime Area designated by introducing legislation to Council to that effect for
passage or (ii) deny the Chief's recommendation in writing to the Chief of
Police.
      (3)    In the event that the Safety Director introduces legislation to
Council recommending the designation of a High Crime Area, Council shall
consider such legislation. If such legislation is adopted by Council, then a
High Crime Area shall be designated in accordance with the terms and provisions
of this ordinance.
   (c)   The Village shall cause any designated High Crime Area to be
identified with signage warning persons of the existence of a High Crime Area.
Such signage shall be approved and developed by the Village Police Department.
   (d)   In the event that any street or area is designated as a High Crime
Area hereunder, the Village shall make good faith efforts at outreach to the
community as to the existence of the High Crime Area and its specific location,
by providing said information to its residents in the Village newsletter, and
by informing a newspaper of general circulation within the Village of such High
Crime Area designation.
   (e)   A High Crime Area shall no longer be designated as a High Crime Area
if a period of six (6) months has lapsed since the last violent or dangerous
crime has occurred there or if the Safety Director deems it appropriate, in the
Safety Director's sole discretion, to remove said High Crime Area designation.
   (f)   For purposes of this section, violent or dangerous crime shall include
incidents or a series of incidents which, in the collective discretion of the
Chief of Police, Safety Director and Village Council, warrant designation as a
High Crime Area and implementation of the warning systems included in this
section.

1357.01 COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   The Construction Site Conservation Plan developed to meet this regulation
will be coordinated and combined with the Riparian and Wetland Setback Plan and
the Post-Construction Water Quality Plan that are developed for the same site.
These plans will be titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan for the site. The Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plan so developed will serve as the Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES Storm Water
Permit for General Construction. (Ord. 2008-11. Passed 4-15-08.)
1357.02 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The intent of this regulation is to establish consistent technically
feasible and operationally practical standards to achieve a level of storm
water management, and erosion and sediment control that will minimize damage to
public and private property and the degradation of water resources, and will
promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the
Community.
   (b)   This regulation further intends, but is not limited to:
      (1)   Allow development while minimizing increases in downstream
flooding, erosion and sedimentation.
      (2)   Reduce damage to receiving water resources and drainage systems
that is caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing
activities.
      (4)   Assure that development site owners control the volume and rate of
storm water runoff originating from their property so that surface and ground
water are protected, soil erosion is controlled and flooding potential is not
increased.
      (5)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the building site and minimize the need to construct,
repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems.
      (6)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands and wells.
      (7)   Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
      (8)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
      (9)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and storm
water management practices that are the result of inadequate soil erosion,
sediment and storm water control.
      (10)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to
address problems caused by inadequate storm water, erosion and sediment
control.
      (11)   Require the construction of storm water management practices that
serve multiple purposes including flood control, soil erosion and sediment
control, and require water quality protection; and encourage such practices
that promote, recreation and habitat preservation.
      (12)   Ensure that all storm water management, soil erosion and sediment
control practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
         (Ord. 2008-11. Passed 4-15-08.)
1357.03 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Neither submission of a plan under the provisions herein, nor compliance
with the provisions of these regulations, shall relieve any person or entity
from responsibility for damage to any person or property that is otherwise
imposed by law.
(Ord. 2008-11. Passed 4-15-08.)
1357.04 CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by other Community provisions of law, ordinance, contract
or deed, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   (b)   If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of these regulations invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)   These regulations shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Compliance with the
provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the Community to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting there from,
and shall not result in the Community, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting therefrom.
(Ord. 2008-11. Passed 4-15-08.)
1357.05 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter and its regulations shall become effective upon their passage.
(Ord. 2008-11. Passed 4-15-08.)

1357.08 ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS FOR RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Former Section
1357.08 was repealed by Ordinance 2014-09, passed February 18, 2014).
1357.09 CONSTRUCTION SITE CONSERVATION PLAN.
   (a)   In order to control storm water damage and sediment pollution of water
resources, wetlands, riparian areas, other natural areas, and public and
private lands, the owner of each development area shall be responsible for
developing a comprehensive Construction Site Conservation Plan. This plan will
address storm water management (volume and peak rate of runoff), soil erosion,
sediment and other wastes control. This plan must contain a description of
controls appropriate for each construction operation covered by these
regulations, and the operator must implement the planned controls in a timely
manner. The plans and BMPs used to satisfy the conditions of these regulations
shall meet the standards and specifications in the current edition of the Ohio
Rain Water and Land Development manual. The plans must make use of the
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the Maximum Extent
Practicable. The plan shall identify the subcontractors engaged in activities
that could impact storm water runoff. The Construction Site Conservation Plan
shall contain signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating
that they have been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in
complying with the Construction Site Conservation Plan.
(Ord. 2014-09. Passed 2-18-14.)
      (1)   If the community intends to require soil erosion, sediment and
storm water management controls on construction sites that disturb less than 1
acre (43,560 square feet) the next subsection should be included. This section
needs to be deleted if small construction sites are not to be regulated by this
chapter.
       (2)   The lower limit of 8,000 square feet of disturbed land area is
used in this model because at least one community in northeast Ohio has used
this threshold for several years. The Community can select an alternative
threshold value of its choosing not to exceed 1 acre in size.
   (b)   Repealed.
   (c)   Development Sites 1 (One) Acre In Size or Larger. All developments
that have a larger common plan of development or sale equal to or larger than
one (1) acre in size of disturbed area are subject to this chapter and shall
follow all of the requirements set forth in this chapter.
      (1)   Description of the plan of construction. The following information
shall be included in the Construction Site Conservation Plan:

(e.g., low density residential, shopping mall, highway, etc.).
            3.   A description of the total area of the site and the area of
the site that is expected to be disturbed (i.e., grubbing, clearing,
excavating, filling or grading, including off-site borrow, fill or spoil areas
and off-site utility installation areas).
            4.   An estimate of the impervious area and percent of
imperviousness created by the construction activity.
            5.   The types of soils within, or affected by, the development
area, and the location of all highly erodible or unstable soils as determined

the changing of final grade from that described by the grading plan. (Ord.
2008-11. Passed 4-15-08.)
1357.11 MAINTENANCE.
   Any portion of the permanent drainage and soil erosion systems, including
on-site and off-site storage facilities that are constructed by the owner, will
be continuously maintained into perpetuity.
   (a)   Maintenance plans  shall be provided by the permittee to both the
Community Engineer and the post-construction operator of the BMP (including
homeowner associations) upon completion of construction activities and prior to
the Community Engineer giving final approval for the completed construction.
   (b)   Single Family and Multi-family Residential Developments. A Homeowners'
Association shall be created and placed in title of the affected lands and
shall be continuously responsible for post-construction maintenance and
inspections into perpetuity unless such maintenance and inspections become
officially accepted by the Community.
   (c)   Apartments, Commercial and Industrial Developments. The plans will
clearly state that the owner of the property shall be continuously responsible
for post-construction maintenance and inspections into perpetuity unless the
Community officially accepts such maintenance and inspections.
   (d)   Maintenance Design. All temporary and permanent soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be designed and constructed to minimize
maintenance requirements. Multi-use facilities incorporating assets such as
aesthetics and recreation may be incorporated into the design of the drainage
facilities. All permanent drainage, soil erosion, sediment control, water
quality management systems and BMPs, including on-site and off-site structures
and vegetation that are constructed or planted, must be inspected and
maintained into perpetuity by the responsible party designated in the plans.
Inspections and maintenance will be incorporated periodically throughout the
year to ensure that the facilities are properly operational.
    (e)   Perpetual Maintenance Inspections. One (1) inspection with a written
report will be performed each year. The written report will be given to the
Community Engineer by May 1st of each and every year after the Best Management
Practice (BMP) has been completed.
      (1)   Structures that require a permit from the Ohio Division of Water. A
written and stamped report from a professional engineer on the status of all
structural BMPs that require a permit from the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources (ODNR) Division of Water. This applies to all BMPs that require a
permit either at the time of construction or fall under the jurisdiction of the
ODNR Division of Water at any time after construction is completed.
      (2)   Easements. A written report from an inspector on the status of all
storm water management easements for each project shall be submitted to the
Community Engineer by May 1st of each year into perpetuity. These reports will
document if restricted plantings, fences and structures are on the easement and
will identify the location of the noted easement restriction violations.
      (3)   Best Management Practices (BMPs) that do not have a hiqh risk for
loss of life, bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure related
to imminent failure as determined by the Community Engineer. A written and
stamped report from a professional engineer, landscape architect or Certified
Professional In Erosion and Sediment Control (CPESC) on the status of permanent
soil erosion, sediment control, water quality management systems and the status
of the related easements shall be submitted to the Community Engineer by May
1st of each year into perpetuity.
      (4)   BMPs that have a potential loss of Life. A written and stamped
report covering the status of all BMPs that have a potential for loss of life,
bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be prepared by a
professional engineer or other individual possessing a valid state license that
authorizes them to design the same type of BMP for construction.
         (Ord. 2008-11. Passed 4-15-08.)
1357.12 MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   (a)   The plan  shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from
disturbed areas so as to prevent soil erosion from occurring.
   (b)   Structural Practices  shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than 14 days.
(Ord. 2008-11. Passed 4-15-08.)
   (c)   Sediment Barriers. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by Silt Fence or Diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment. Where intended to provide sediment control, Silt
Fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the maximum
drainage areas to Silt Fence for a particular slope is shown in the table below
(placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the size of the
drainage area).
Table 1: Silt Fence Applicability
 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of Silt Fence               drainage area (in percent)
0.5                                     < 2%
0.25                                    > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                   > 20% but < 50%
 
This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to control
sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier shall
not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw Bale Barriers
are not acceptable.
(Ord. 2014-09. Passed 2-18-14.)
   (d)   Storm Water Diversion Practices. Storm water diversion practices shall
be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include Swales, Dikes or Berms, Pipe Slope
Drains and Diversions, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten (10)
acres, Storm water diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless those are used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.
   (f)   Clearing and Grubbing  will be done in two (2) or more phases. The
first phase will include only those locations necessary to install the
perimeter soil erosion, sediment and storm water control BMPs. After the
perimeter controls are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of
clearing and grubbing may continue.
   (g)   Timing of Sediment Trapping Practices. Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth disturbing
activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended
to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7)
days from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up
slope development area is permanently restabilized. As construction progresses
and the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or
existing controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
(Ord. 2008-11. Passed 4-15-08.)
   (h)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as
specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES Storm Water
Permit Rules, whichever is most restrictive:
Table 2: Permanent Stabilization
 
Area requiring permanent stabilization  Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any areas that will lie dormant for one Within seven (7) days of the most
(1) year or more                        recent disturbance

Table 3: Temporary Stabilization
 
Area requiring temporary stabilization  Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any disturbed areas within fifty (50)   Within two (2) days of the most recent
feet of a stream and not at final grade disturbance if the area will remain
                                        idle for more than fourteen (14) days
                                        Within seven (7) days of the most
                                        recent disturbance within the area
                                         
For all construction activities, any    For residential subdivisions, disturbed
disturbed areas that will be dormant    areas must be stabilized at least seven
for more than twenty-one (21) days but  (7) days prior to transfer of NPDES
less than one (1) year, and not within  permit coverage for the individual lot
fifty (50) feet of a surface water of   (s). Proof of permit coverage transfer
the State                               from Ohio EPA must be submitted to the
                                        Community Engineer. The Community
                                        Engineer shall then inspect the lot to
                                        ensure that the Temporary Seeding has
                                        been done
Disturbed areas that will be idle over  Prior to the onset of winter weather
winter
 
   (i)   Sediment Settling Ponds: 
      (1)   A sediment settling pond is required for any one of the following
conditions:
         A.   Concentrated storm water runoff (e.g., storm sewer or ditch);
         B.   Runoff from drainage areas, which exceed the design capacity of
silt fence or other sediment barriers;
         C.   Runoff from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of
inlet protection; or
         D.   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land. Alternative controls can be used if the owner can show, in
writing, that the Ohio EPA approved the use of alternatives that the owner
demonstrated to be equivalent in effectiveness to a sediment settling pond.
      (2)   Where storm sewer drainage areas include 10 or more acres disturbed
at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must be provided
until final stabilization of the site. In single-family residential
construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and permanent
landscaping is done.
         A.   It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than 10
acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or sediment traps be used.
      (3)   Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than 1800 cubic
feet of dewatering zone area per acre of total contributing drainage area and
1000 cubic feet per disturbed acre of sediment storage zone area. The storage
volume will be measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the primary
(principal) spillway.
      (4)   Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least 48 hours, or meet the
criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual whichever is most
stringent.
      (5)   The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of
width (> 2:1 length to width ratio); a length to width ratio of 4:1 is
recommended.
      (6)   The depth of the dewatering zone of the sediment settling pond must
be less than or equal to five (5) feet.
      (7)   Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when the
design capacity has been reduced by forty percent (40%).
      (8)   Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (9)   Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any
stream channel.
(Ord. 2014-09. Passed 2-18-14.)
   (j)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection.
      (1)   All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a Sediment Settling
Pond and is exempted in writing by the Community Engineer. In areas where
construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection
shall be maintained until all up slope areas reach final stabilization, as
determined by the Community Engineer.
      (2)   At the end of this period the site owner shall hydraulically clean
the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the Community Engineer. All sediments
shall be removed from the system and shall not be flushed downstream.
   (k)   Storm Sewer and Other Drainage Outlets. All storm sewers, footer
drains, roof gutter drains and all other drains will be outletted at the bottom
of the slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the water
being drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion
of the stream or channel banks or channel bottom or other areas that the water
is outletted on.
   (l)   Working Near, or Crossing Streams and Wetlands.
      (1)   Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross these
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed.
Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be
restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or
stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings.
      (2)   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip,
or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by
the approving authority and, when applicable, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
and Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
      (3)   If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to streams,
structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect the
adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
      (4)   No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed in
a stream channel.
       (5)   Streams and wetland setbacks required by the community will be
implemented. As a minimum a setback of 25 feet, as measured from the ordinary
high water mark of the surface water, will be maintained in its natural state
as a permanent buffer.
   (m)   Construction Entrance.
      (1)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public
roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
      (2)   Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be implemented
as required by the Community Engineer and the Ohio EPA. These will be planned
and installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition of the
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual.
      (3)   Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in
order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds exist and are properly
functioning.
      (4)   Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable
equipment to cross curbs. Nonerosive materials (e.g. wood and stone) can be
used.
   (n)   Unstable Soils.
      (1)   Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county Soil
Survey or by a detailed soils report.
      (2)   The Community Engineer may require detailed soil reports when
deemed necessary.
      (3)   Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (o)   Cut And Fill Slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization. The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ratio of 2:1
(the horizontal will be two (2) times the vertical).
(Ord. 2008-11. Passed 4-15-08.)
   (p)   Stabilization of Outfalls and Channels. the expected velocity of flow
from the planned post-development frequency storm without eroding. The planned
post-construction velocity and flow shall include the entire contributing
watershed. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge locations
and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive velocity
from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical and
biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected. (Ord.
2014-09. Passed 2-18-14.)
   (q)   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation. A permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the Community Engineer, has 80% vegetative
density over the entire disturbed area and provides adequate cover, and is
mature enough to satisfactorily control soil erosion and survive adverse
weather conditions.
   (r)   Disposition of Temporary Practices. All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the Community Engineer. Trapped sediment
shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion. The Construction
Maintenance Guarantee shall not be released by the Community until all
temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices that are no longer needed
have been removed, properly disposed of and any trapped sediment has been
stabilized.
   (s)   Underground Utility Construction. The construction of underground
utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria:
      (1)   Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days.
      (2)   There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting
from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it
must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site or to
waters of the State.
      (3)   When discharging clean ground water care must be taken to ensure
that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or
other pollutant sources.
(Ord. 2008-11. Passed 4-15-08.)
   (t)   Inspections.
      (1)    If inspections or other information indicates a control has been
used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or
modified for the site conditions.
      (2)    The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected
for soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven
(7) calendar days, and within twenty-four (24) hours of a 0.5 inch or greater
rainfall event until the Community Engineer certifies the site as being stable.
The Community Engineer certification does not relieve the permittee from
meeting the Ohio EPA NPDES inspection requirements.
      (3)    The inspection frequency may be reduced to at least once every
month if the entire site is temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to
weather conditions (e.g., the site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is
frozen.) A waiver of inspection requirements is available until one month
before thawing conditions are expected to result in a discharge if all of the
following conditions are met: the project is located in an area where frozen
conditions are anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e., more
than one month); land disturbance activities have been suspended; and the
beginning and ending dates of the waiver period are documented. Once a
definable area has been fully stabilized, you may mark this on your plans and
no further inspection requirements apply to that portion of the site.
      (4)    Following each inspection, a checklist must be completed and
signed by the qualified inspection personnel representative. At a minimum, the
inspection report must include:
         A.   The inspection date;
         B.   Names, titles, and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection;
         C.   Weather information for the period since the last inspection
including the timing, duration, and depth of any storms;
         D.   Weather information and a description of any discharges occurring
at the time of the inspection;
         E.   Location(s) of discharges of sediment or other pollutants from
the site;
         F.   Location(s) of BMPs that need to be maintained;
         G.   Location(s) of BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location;
         H.   Location(s) where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist
at the time of the inspection; and,
         I.   Corrective action required including any necessary changes to the
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan and implementation dates.
      (5)    The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to
correct problems noted in past inspection logs.
      (6)    If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for construction
activity, a copy of all of the required inspection sheets will be submitted to
the Community Engineer within three (3) working days of the date that the
inspection was conducted.

grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical,
discharging roof water to vegetated areas, or grass and rocklined drainage
channels.
      (2)   Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a level of
control in flow paths and stream gradients.
      (3)   Induced infiltration of increased storm water runoff into soil,
where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas where
soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be vegetated, or
providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities.

         (Ord. 2008-11. Passed 4-15-08.)
1357.13 STREAM CHANNEL AND FLOODPLAIN EROSION DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Runoff Rate. The peak runoff rate from the development area shall not
be greater after development than it was before development. The applicant
shall provide calculations proving no increase in the runoff rates from the one
(1), two (2), five (5), ten (10), twenty-five (25), fifty (50) and one hundred
(100) year storms.
   (b)   Runoff Volume. Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by
further restricting runoff rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the
applicant shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The
runoff rate from the critical storm shall be restricted to the one (1) year
pre-development storm runoff rate. The critical storm shall be calculated as
follows:
      (1)   Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency,
twenty-four hour storm, occurring on the development area before and after
development.
      (2)   From the volumes in subsection (a) hereof determine the percent of
increase in volume of runoff due to development according to the equation (Q
after divided by the Q before) X 100 and, using this percentage, select the
critical storm from this table:
Table 4: Critical Storm Selection
The Percentage Increase In Volume Of Runoff Is:

Equal To Or                The 24-Hour “Critical Storm” for Discharge Will Be
Greater Than And Less Than
0            10            1 Year
10           20            2 Years
20           50            5 Years
50           100           10 Years
100          250           25 Years
250          500           50 Years
500          ---           100 Years
   (c)   Detention or Retention Basic Exemption for Redevelopment or for
Expansion of Existing Facilities.
      (1)   For any development regulated by this chapter, the construction of
a detention or retention basin may not be required for the development if the
post-development peak discharge for a 100 year frequency 24 hour storm
increases the existing peak discharge by one (1) cubic foot per second or less
using the TR-55 method of calculation or other method approved by the Community
Engineer. The Community Engineer can waive this requirement if existing storm
sewers and drainage structures can safely handle the expected increase in flow.
      (2)   Only one (1) exemption will be allowed per parcel. Any subsequent
expansion must provide for detention or retention and must include the
previously exempted area.
   (d)   Where the Community Engineer determines that site constraints exist in
a manner that compromises the intent of this chapter to improve the management
of storm water runoff as established in this section, practical alternatives
may be used to result in an improvement of water quality and/or a reduction of
storm water runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping with the intent and
likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be required to meet the
objectives of this section. When possible, all practical alternatives shall be
implemented within the drainage area of the proposed development project.
   Practical alternatives can include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Fees shall be paid in an amount specified by the Community
Engineer. These fees shall be applied by the Community to storm water
management practices that reduce existing storm water runoff.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site storm water management practices.
      (3)   Watershed or stream restoration.
      (4)   Retrofitting of an existing storm water management practice.

maintained for a period of not less than 2 (two) years after final acceptance
of the storm water, soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control practices
in an amount equal to 20% of the estimate approved by the Community Engineer,
of the construction and, where necessary, removal of such practices,
      (4)   Time extension. The Community Engineer may extend for cause the
time allowed for the installation of the improvements for which the performance
guarantee has been provided with the receipt of a written request from the
owner.
       (5)   Completion. Upon completion of the construction of improvements or
temporary and/or permanent soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control
practices and the removal of the temporary soil erosion, sediment, and other
wastes control practices for which the performance guarantee has been provided,
the owner shall notify the Community Engineer of this fact.
      (6)   Inspection. The Community will not release the Security Bond,
Escrow Account, Verified Check or Cash guarantee until the Community Engineer
has inspected the site to ensure that the guaranteed item(s) have been
completed and/or removed.
      (7)   Slow release devices. Performance and maintenance guarantees will
be maintained on the temporary sediment removal slow release devices installed
in detention and retention basins until the entire site has reached final soil
stabilization. Final stabilization in single-family residential developments is
when 90% of the homes are constructed with their lawns completely installed and
any remaining unbuilt lots having been permanently stabilized with a uniform
ground cover at a growth density of 80% or better.
      (8)   Release. The Construction Maintenance Guarantee shall not be
released by the Community until all temporary soil erosion and sediment control
practices that are no longer needed have been removed, properly disposed of and
any trapped sediment has been stabilized.

1359.01 COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   The Post-Construction Water Quality Plan developed to meet this regulation
will be coordinated and combined with the Riparian and Wetland Setback Plan and
the Construction Site Conservation Plan that are developed for the same site.
These plans will be titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan for the site. The Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plan so developed will serve as the Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES Storm Water
Permit for General Construction.
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 2-18-14.)
1359.02 PURPOSE.

   (a)   Allow development while reducing damage to receiving water resources
and drainage systems that may be caused by new development or redevelopment
activities.
   (b)   Protect and maintain the receiving stream's physical, chemical,
biological characteristics and stream functions.
   (c)   Provide perpetual management of storm water runoff quality and
quantity.
   (d)   Establish consistent technically feasible and operationally practical
standards to achieve a level of storm water quantity and quality control that
will minimize damage to public and private property and degradation of water
resources, and will promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the
residents of the Community.
   (e)   Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing activities.
   (f)   Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), the natural
drainage characteristics of the building site.
   (g)   Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), natural
infiltration and groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that
replenishes water resources, wetlands, and wells.
   (h)   Assure that storm water quality controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
   (i)   Reduce the need for costly treatment and mitigation for the damage to
and loss of water resources that are the result of inadequate storm water
quality control.
   (j)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to address
problems caused by inadequate storm water quality control.
   (k)   Require the incorporation of water quality protection that encourages
and promotes habitat preservation into the construction of storm water
management practices.
   (l)   Ensure that all storm water quality practices are properly designed,
constructed, and maintained.
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 2-18-14.)
1359.03 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Neither submission of a plan under the provisions herein, nor compliance
with the provisions of these regulations, shall relieve any person or entity
from responsibility for damage to any person or property that is otherwise
imposed by law.
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 2-18-14.)
 
1359.04 CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   Where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by other Village of Newburgh Heights provisions of law,
ordinance, contract or deed, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   (b)   If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of these regulations invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)   These regulations shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Compliance with the
provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the Village of Newburgh Heights to observe or recognize
hazardous or unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not
relieve the owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting
there from, and shall not result in the Village of Newburgh Heights, its
officers, employees, or agents being responsible for any condition or damage
resulting therefrom.
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 2-18-14.)
1359.05 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter and its regulations shall become effective upon their passage.
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 2-18-14.)
1359.06 SCOPE.
   This chapter applies to development areas having new or relocated projects
involving highways, underground cables, pipelines, subdivisions, industrial
projects, commercial projects, building activities on farms, redevelopment of
urban areas and all other land uses not specifically exempted. This chapter
does not apply to:
   (a)   Land-disturbing activities related to producing agricultural crops or
Silviculture operations regulated by the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution
Abatement Rules (1501: 15-3-01 to 1501: 15-3-09 of the Ohio Administrative
Code) and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
   (b)   Strip mining operations regulated by Chapter 1513 of the Ohio Revised
Code and existing at the time of passage of this regulation.
   (c)   Surface mining operations regulated by Chapter 1514 of the Ohio

   (d)   Construction activities that do not include the installation of any
impervious surface (e.g., soccer fields), abandoned mine reclamation activities
regulated by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, stream and wetland
restoration activities, and wetland mitigation activities.
   (e)   Linear construction projects, (e.g., pipeline or utility line
installation), which do not result in the installation of impervious surface
and are independent of other construction projects (not part of a larger common
plan of development or sale). However, linear construction projects must be
designed to minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of
disturbance and achieve final stabilization of the disturbed area as defined in
the "Definitions" section of this chapter.
   (f)   Transportation projects that are subject to industry specific Ohio EPA
Rules are exempt from these rules.
   (g)   It is not the role of the community to point out each and every part
of the rules and how to implement them on the individual job sites. It is the
project owner's responsibility to be proactive in meeting the intent, purpose
and requirements of these regulations.
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 2-18-14.)
1359.07 CONSULTATIONS.
   In implementing these regulations the Village of Newburgh Heights Engineer
or other Village of Newburgh Heights officials may consult with the local
county SWCD, state and federal agencies and other technical experts as
necessary. Any costs associated with such consultations may be assessed to the
applicant or his or her designated representative
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 2-18-14.)
 
1359.08 POST-CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN.

   (d)   The plan must make use of the practices that preserve the existing
natural condition to the Maximum Extent Practicable (MEP).
   (e)   To meet the Post-Construction requirements of this regulation, the
Post-Construction Water Quality Plan must contain a description of the Post-
Construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) that will be installed during
construction for the site and the rationale for their selection. The rationale
must address the anticipated impacts on the channel and floodplain morphology,
hydrology, and water quality.
   (f)   Structural post-construction BMPs cannot be installed within a State

depending on the size of the development sites as well as any additional
information required by the Village of Newburgh Heights engineer:
      (1)    Development Sites Smaller than Five Acres: A development site that
will disturb one (1) or more, but less than five (5) acres of land and is not a
part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five or
more acres of land shall identify:
         A.   Storm Water Issues: A statement as to how the decreased storm
water quality that will be caused by the planned development project will be

areas will be identified on the plans. They will also be marked in the field
prior to the start of construction.
         F.   BMPs: Best Management Practices used in the Post-Construction
Water Quality Plan may include but are not limited to:
            1.   Permanent Storm Water Detention ponds that provide extended
detention of the water volume.
            2.   Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and natural
depressions.
            3.   Onsite infiltration of runoff.
            4.   Sequential systems that combine several practices.
            5.   Permanent conservation easements, preferably with the easement
being held by a third party with no vested interest in ever seeing the property

and protect water quality.
      (2)    Development Sites 5 Acres or Larger. A development site that
disturbs five (5) or more acres of land or will disturb less than five (5)
acres, but is a part of a larger common plan of development or sale, which will
disturb five (5) or more acres of land shall identify:
         A.   Storm Water Detention: The Post-Construction BMP(s) chosen must
be able to detain storm water runoff for protection of the stream channels,
stream erosion control, and improved water quality.
         B.   Structural BMPs: Structural (designed) Post-Construction storm
water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage
system for the site.
         C.   Properly Sized BMPs: The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to treat the
water quality volume (WQv) and ensure compliance with Ohio's Water Quality
Standards in OAC Chapter 3745- 1. The WQv shall be equivalent to the volume of
runoff from a 0.75-inch rainfall and shall be determined according to the
following equation:
            1.   WQv = C * P * A / 12 where: WQv = water quality volume in
acre-feet C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 inch
(either using Table 1 or the following formula: C=0.858i - 0.78i2 + 0.774i +
0.04 where i=fraction of post-construction impervious area) P = 0.75 inch
precipitation depth A = area draining into the BMP in acres.
Table 1 Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (> 8 dwellings/acre)      0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
         D.   Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should
be calculated using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing
drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is Low Density
Residential, 30% is High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff
coefficient is calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3) + (0.3)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.2) =
0.35.
         E.   An additional volume equal to 20 percent of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration
capacity. The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology included in
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, ODOT Post-Construction storm
water standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio EPA.
         F.   The BMPs listed in Table 2 below shall be considered standard
BMPs approved for general use. However, communities with a regulated MS4 may
limit the use of some of these BMPs. BMPs shall be designed such that the drain
time is long enough to provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage
available for successive rainfall events and avoid the creation of nuisance
conditions. The outlet structure for the post-construction BMP must not
discharge more than the first half of the WQv in less than one-third of the
drain time.

*    Dry basins must include forebay and micropool each sized at 10% of the WQv
**    Provide both a permanent pool and an EDv above the permanent pool, each
sized at 0.75 WQv
+    Extended detention shall be provided for the full WQv above the permanent
water pool.
^    The WQv shall completely infiltrate within 48 hours so there is no
standing or residual water in the BMP.
#    Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal to
the WQv.
         G.   The owner may request approval from the Community Engineer to use
alternative structural Post-Construction BMPs if the owner can demonstrate, in
a way that is acceptable to Ohio EPA rules and regulations, that the
alternative BMPs are equivalent in effectiveness to those listed in Table 2
above. The use of alternative or vendor supplied Post-Construction BMPs should
be limited to redevelopment projects where justification is provided that the
traditional BMPs in Table 2 are technically and economically infeasible.
         H.   Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition if it
can be demonstrated that the WQv is provided within an existing structural
Post-Construction BMP that is part of a larger common plan of development or
sale or if structural Post-Construction BMPs are addressed in a regional or
local storm water management plan. A municipally operated regional storm water
BMP can be used as a post-construction BMP provided that the BMP can detain the
WQv from the entire drainage area and release it over a 24 hour period upon
written permission from the Community Engineer.
         I.   For redevelopment projects (i.e., developments on previously
developed property), Post- Construction practices shall either ensure a 20
percent net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at
least 20 percent of the WQv, or a combination of the two. Where projects are a
combination of new development and redevelopment, the total WQv that must be
treated shall be calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the
new development at 100 per cent WQv and redevelopment at 20 percent WQv.
         J.   Site Description:
            1.   The prior land uses of the site.
            2.   The nature and type of construction activity (e.g., low
density residential, shopping mall, highway, etc.).
            3.   Total area of the site and the area of the site that is
expected to be disturbed (i.e., grubbing, clearing, excavating, filling or
grading, including off-site borrow, fill or spoil areas and off-site utility
installation areas).
            4.   Amount of the impervious area and percent imperviousness
created by the construction activity.

the development site including, but not limited to:
            4.   Water resources such as wetlands, springs, lakes, ponds,
rivers and streams (including intermittent streams with a defined bed and
bank).
            5.   Conservation Easements.
            6.   Other sensitive natural resources and areas receiving runoff
from the development.
         L.   The existing and proposed topography shown in the appropriate
contour intervals as determined by the Community Engineer (generally one-foot
contours are used).
         M.   The location and description of existing and proposed drainage

         B.   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three
(3) feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of 3%, which extends
outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum of 25
feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and maintenance vehicles
that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may be landscaped,
without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water pool.
            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (3 feet horizontal for every 1 foot vertical).
            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of 15 inches below the
normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to prevent
access to the deeper water pool. The aquatic bench may also be incorporated
into the Post-Construction Water Quality Plan.
            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (2 feet horizontal for every 1 foot
vertical).
            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards. Side slopes getting to the pond shall
not exceed 3:1 and shall terminate on a safety bench.
      (9)   Water Quality Basin: If a Water Quality Basin is needed and cannot
be incorporated into an existing or planned Detention or Retention Basin then a
separate Water Quality Basin will need to be planned, designed, constructed and
maintained into perpetuity.
      (10)   Water Quality Basins will not be constructed in any permanent or
intermittent stream channel.
      (11)   Flexibility: These standards are general guidelines and shall not
limit the right of the Village of Newburgh Heights Engineer to impose at any
time additional and/or more stringent requirements nor shall the standards
limit the right of the Community Engineer to waive, in writing, individual
requirements.
   If the Community Engineer waives, in writing, individual requirements the
owner will provide the Community Engineer with the information and
documentation required to assure Ohio EPA that the waived requirement will not
degrade water quality.

1359.12  REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
   Sites that have been previously developed where no Post-Construction BMPs
were installed shall either ensure a 20 percent net reduction of the site
impervious area, provide for treatment of at least 20 percent of the WQv, or a
combination of the two. A one-for-one credit towards the 20 percent net
reduction of impervious area can be obtained through the use of pervious
pavement and/or green roofs. Where projects are a combination of new
development and redevelopment, the total WQv that must be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with new development at 100
percent and redevelopment at 20 percent WQv.
(Ord. 2014-08. Passed 2-18-14.)

storm water runoff as established in this chapter, practical alternatives may
be used to result in an improvement of water quality and/or a reduction of
storm water runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping with the intent and
likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be required to meet the
objectives of this section. All practical alternatives shall be implemented
within the drainage area of the proposed development project unless
specifically authorized in writing by the Community Engineer.
   (a)   Implementation of off-site storm water management practices: The use
of any off-site Post- Construction BMPs requires written approval from Ohio EPA
and this approval must be received prior to design approval and/or issuance of
any building permits. Practical alternatives to be considered include:
      (1)   Retrofitting of an existing storm water management practice.
      (2)   Watershed or stream restoration.
      (3)   Fees paid in an amount specified by the Community Engineer. The
Community shall apply these fees to storm water management practices that
improve the existing water quality.
   (b)   Use of Alternative Post-Construction BMPs: Permittees must supply
written approval from Ohio EPA to use Post-Construction BMPs that have been
demonstrated to be equivalent to the effectiveness of those listed in Table 2
above. Approval from Ohio EPA must be received prior to design approval and/or
issuance of any building permits.

1361.01 COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   The Riparian and Wetland Setback Plan developed to meet this regulation will
be coordinated and combined with the Post-Construction Water Quality Plan and
the Construction Site Conservation Plan that are developed for the same site.
These plans will be titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a
Comprehensive Storm Water Management Plan for the site. The Comprehensive Storm
Water Management Plan so developed will serve as the Storm Water Pollution
Prevention Plan (SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES Storm Water
Permit for General Construction.
(Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-15-08.)
1361.02 PURPOSE.
   The intent of this regulation is to:
   (a)   Protect the receiving stream's physical, chemical, and biological
characteristics and to maintain stream functions.
   (b)   Establish consistent, technically feasible and operationally practical
standards to achieve a level of storm water quantity and quality control that
will minimize damage to public and private property and degradation of water
resources, and will promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the
residents of the Community.
    (c)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the community and building sites and minimize the need to
construct, repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems.
   (d)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
ground water recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands, and wells.
   (e)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
   (f)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and storm
water management practices that are the result of inadequate storm water
control due to the loss of riparian areas and wetlands.
   (g)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to address
problems caused by inadequate storm water control.
      (Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-15-08.)
1361.03 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   Neither submission of a plan under the provisions herein, nor compliance
with the provisions of these regulations, shall relieve any person or entity
from responsibility for damage to any person or property that is otherwise
imposed by law.
(Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-15-08.)
1361.04 CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES AND RESPONSIBILITY.

imposed or required by other Community provisions of law, ordinance, contract
or deed, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   (b)   If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of these regulations invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)   These regulations shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on his or her property. Compliance with
the provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate
such nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the Community to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom,
and shall not result in the Community, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting therefrom.

(Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-15-08.)
1361.08 RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACK REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that the system of wetlands, riparian areas,
rivers, streams, and other natural watercourses within the Community
contributes to the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents. The
specific purpose and intent of this part of these regulations is to regulate
uses and developments within riparian and wetland setbacks that would impair
the ability of riparian and wetland areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of floodwaters, and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist in stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce bank
erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse
banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling,
transforming and absorbing pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food.
      (6)   Provide habitat to a wide array of aquatic organisms, wildlife,
many of which are on Ohio's Endangered and/or Threatened Species listings, by
maintaining diverse and connected riparian and wetland vegetation.
      (7)   Benefit the Community economically by minimizing encroachment on
wetlands and watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions
such as dams, retention basins, and rip rap to protect structures and reduce
property damage and threats to the safety of residents; and by contributing to
the scenic beauty and environment of the Community, and thereby preserving the
character of the Community, the quality of life of the residents of the
Community, and corresponding property values.
   (b)   The following regulations have been enacted to protect these services
of riparian and wetland areas by providing reasonable controls governing
structures and uses within a wetland and/or riparian setback along designated
watercourses in the Community.
   (c)   Applicability and Compliance.
      (1)   These regulations shall apply to:
         A.   All lands that are within the jurisdiction of the Community and
that border designated watercourses and wetlands as defined in these
regulations.
         B.   These regulations shall apply to property subdivision/ property/
parcel split plan approvals, site plan approvals, and land development plan
approvals requested of the Community.
         C.   These regulations shall apply to all building permits, which
involve soil disturbing activities.
      (2)   The Community shall issue no approvals or permits without full
compliance with the terms of these regulations.
         (Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-15-08.)
1361.09 ESTABLISHMENT OF DESIGNATED WATERCOURSES AND RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)   Designated watercourses shall include those watercourses meeting any
one of the following criteria:
      (1)   All watercourses draining an area greater than ½ square mile, or
      (2)   All watercourses draining an area less than ½ square mile and
having a defined bed and bank.
      (3)   In determining if watercourses have a defined bed and bank, the
Community may consult with a representative of the local county SWCD or other
technical experts as necessary.
   (b)   Riparian setbacks on designated watercourses are established as
follows:
      (1)   A minimum of 300 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining an
area greater than 300 square miles.
      (2)   A minimum of 120 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining an
area greater than 20 square miles and up to and including 300 square miles,
      (3)   A minimum of 75 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining an
area greater than one-half square mile and up to and including 20 square miles.
       (4)   A minimum of 25 feet on both sides of all watercourses draining an
area less than one-half square mile and having a defined bed and bank as

   (c)   Riparian Setback Map.
      (1)   The Community shall use the latest edition of the official soil
survey that shows drainage features, on the paper maps in the back of the book,
as the map identifying designated watercourses and their riparian setbacks. The
drainage features identified on the paper maps in the official soil survey and
the information contained therein shall be believed to be accurate.
      (2)   At the time of application of this regulation, if any discrepancy
is found between the Riparian Setback Map and the criteria for designated
watercourses or riparian setbacks as set forth in these regulations, the
criteria shall prevail.
      (3)   In reviewing and interpreting the maps the Community may consult
with a representative of the local county SWCD and other technical experts as
necessary.
   (d)   The following conditions shall apply in riparian and wetland setbacks:
      (1)   Riparian and wetland setbacks shall be measured in a perpendicular
and horizontal direction outward from the ordinary high water mark of each
designated watercourse and. defined wetland boundary.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, riparian and
wetland setbacks shall be preserved in their natural state, except that non-
conforming structures and non-conforming uses existing at the time of passage
of this regulation may be continued in their existing state as determined in
the Non-conforming Structures or Uses in Riparian and Wetland Setbacks section
of these regulations. Riparian setbacks shall be established and marked in the
field prior to any soil disturbing or land clearing activities.
      (3)   Where the 100-year floodplain is wider than a riparian setback on
either or both sides of a designated watercourse, the riparian setback shall be
extended to the outer edge of the 100-year floodplain. The 100-year floodplain
shall be determined by the project engineer conducting a hydrologic analysis of
the project area in conformance with standard engineering practices and
approved by the Community Engineer.
      (4)   Where wetlands are identified within a riparian setback, the
minimum riparian setback width shall be extended to the outer boundary of the
wetland. In addition, wetlands shall be protected to the extent detailed in
these regulations.
      (5)   Wetlands shall be delineated by a site survey approved by the
Community using delineation protocols accepted by the U.S, Army Corps of
Engineers and the Ohio EPA at the time of application of this regulation. If a
conflict exists between the delineation protocols of these two agencies, the
delineation protocol that results in the most inclusive area of wetland shall
apply.
    (e)   The applicant or his or her designated representative shall be
responsible for delineating riparian and wetland setbacks, including any
expansions or modifications as required by these regulations, and identifying
these setbacks on all property subdivision/property/parcel splits, commercial
development or other land development plans, and/or building permit
applications submitted to the Community, This delineation may be done by a
metes and bounds, or higher level, survey and shall be subject to review and
approval by the Community. As a result of this review, the Community may
consult with a representative of the local county SWCD or other technical
experts as necessary.
   (f)   Prior to any land clearing or soil disturbing activity, riparian and
wetland setbacks shall be clearly delineated on site by the applicant or his or
her designated representative, and such delineation shall be maintained
throughout soil disturbing activities.
   (g)   No approvals or subdivision plan approval, site plan approval, nor
land development plan approval shall be issued by the Community prior to on-
site delineation of riparian and wetland setbacks in conformance with these
regulations. No building permits which include land clearing or soil disturbing
activities shall be issued by the Community prior to delineation of riparian
and wetland setbacks in conformance with these regulations.
   (h)   Upon completion of an approved property subdivision/property/parcel
split, land development, or other improvement, riparian and wetland setbacks
shall be permanently recorded on the plat records of the Community.
      (Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-15-08.)
1361.10 ESTABLISHMENT OF WETLAND SETBACKS.

   (a)   A minimum of 120 feet surrounding and including all Ohio EPA Category
3 Wetlands, or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
   (b)   A minimum of 75 feet surrounding and including all Ohio EPA Category 2
Wetlands, or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
      (Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-15-08.)
1361.11 PROCEDURE FOR WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   No change to parcel boundaries or land use change:
      (1)   Upon filing a request for a building permit that does not involve
changing of any parcel boundaries or changes in land use, the applicant will
check for indicators of wetlands on the National Wetlands Inventory maps, and
Ohio Wetlands Inventory map, and the Cuyahoga County Wetlands Inventory (if
applicable). A photocopy of the applicable section of each map will be attached
to the permit application.
      (2)   If a potential wetland is shown on any of the maps or if there is
reason for the Community to believe that an unmapped wetland exists on or
within 120 feet of the project site the applicant will retain a qualified
wetland professional to evaluate the proposed project site for wetlands or
wetland buffer areas. If no wetland or wetland buffer areas are found, the
applicant shall submit a letter from the qualified wetland professional with
the preliminary plat or permit application verifying his or her negative
findings.
   (b)   New residential or commercial or other type of development and
projects involving a change to parcel boundaries or a land use change:
      (1)   Upon filing a request for approval of a preliminary plat or
building permit for new residential, commercial or other type of development
that involves changes in any parcel boundaries or changes in land use, the
applicant or his or her designated representative shall retain a qualified
wetland professional to survey the proposed development site for wetlands. If
no wetlands are found, the applicant or his or her designated representative
shall submit a letter with the preliminary plat or permit application verifying
that a qualified wetland professional has surveyed the site and found no
wetlands. If wetlands are found, the following procedures shall be followed.
      (2)   A qualified wetland professional, acceptable to the Community
Engineer, shall determine the presence of Ohio EPA Category 2 or 3 wetlands (or
current equivalent Ohio EPA classification) on the proposed development site
using the latest version of the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for wetland
evaluation approved at the time of application of this regulation. Acceptance
of this determination shall be subject to approval by the Community Engineer.
      (3)   If Ohio EPA Category 2 or 3 wetlands (or current equivalent Ohio
EPA classification) are located on the proposed development site, the applicant
or his or her designated representative shall delineate these wetlands and the
wetland setback in conformance with these regulations. The applicant or his or
her designated representative shall identify all delineated wetlands and their
associated setbacks on all property subdivision/property/parcel split plans,
land development plans, and/or permit applications submitted to the Community.
         A.   Wetlands shall be delineated by a site survey, approved by the
Community, using delineation protocols accepted by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and the Ohio EPA at the time of application of this regulation. If
conflict exists between the delineation protocols of these two agencies, the
delineation protocol that results in the most inclusive area of wetland shall
apply.
         B.   Wetland setbacks shall be delineated through a metes and bounds,
or higher level, survey subject to approval by the Community.
      (4)   Prior to any soil or vegetation disturbing activity, the applicant
or his or her designated representative shall delineate wetland setbacks on the
development site in such a way that they can be clearly viewed, and such
delineation shall be maintained throughout construction.
       (5)   No approvals or permits shall be issued by the Community prior to
delineation of wetland setbacks in conformance with this regulation.
   (c)   Upon completion of an approved property subdivision/property/parcel
split, commercial development or other and development or improvement, riparian
and wetland setbacks shall be permanently recorded on the plat records for the
Community and shall be maintained as open space thereafter through a permanent
conservation easement. A third party, not the landowner or permittee or the
Community, which is allowed by state law shall be given the conservation
easement. If no third party will accept the conservation easement, the
Community shall accept it and protect it in perpetuity.
(Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-15-08.)
1361.12 USES PERMITTED IN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   By-Right Uses Without A Permit. Open space uses that are passive in
character shall be permitted in riparian and wetland setbacks, including, but
not limited to, those listed in these regulations. No use permitted under these
regulations shall be construed as allowing public
trespass on privately held lands.
      (1)   Recreational activity. Passive recreational uses, as permitted by
federal, state, and local laws, such as hiking, fishing, hunting, picnicking,
and similar uses.
      (2)   Removal of damaged or diseased trees. Damaged or diseased trees may
be removed.
      (3)   Revegetation and/or reforestation. Riparian and wetland setbacks
may be revegetated with non-invasive plant species.
      (4)   Maintenance of lawns, gardens and landscaping. Lawns, gardens and
landscaping, that existed at the time this chapter was passed, may be
maintained as long as they are not increased in size.
   (b)   By-Right Uses With A Permit.
      (1)   Selective harvesting of timber. Selective harvesting of timber may
be allowed upon presentation of a Forest Management and Harvest Plan prepared
by a Qualified Forester and accepted by the Community Engineer.
         A.   Any landowner harvesting timber for sale shall post a $1,000
performance guarantee with the Community, This performance guarantee shall be
in the form of a Security Bond, Escrow Account, Certified Check or Cash, and it
shall be held until completion of the timber-harvesting operation.
         B.   Due to the potential for felled logs and branches to damage
downstream properties and/or to block ditches or otherwise exacerbate flooding,
logs or branches resulting from permitted selective harvesting that are greater
than 6 inches in diameter at the cut end shall be cut into sections no longer
than 6 feet or removed from the 100-year floodplain. Harvested trees or felled
logs and branches that are part of a designed and approved Streambank
Stabilization and Erosion Control Measure shall be allowed to remain in a
designated watercourse.
         C.   The Forest Management and Harvest Plan must:
            1.   Show that the site will be adequately stocked after the
approved selective harvest. "Adequately stocked" shall be defined as the
residual stocking level greater than the B-Level on the Allegheny Hardwood
Stocking Guide produced by the United States Forest Service, or other United
States Forest Service stocking guides as dictated by the forest community to be
harvested.
            2.   Show that trees located less than 25 feet from the ordinary
high water mark will not be impacted by the proposed harvesting.
            3.   Include a map of the site. This map shall specify the location
of any skid and haul roads required for transporting harvested trees and fire
wood from riparian and wetland setbacks.
            4.   Include the method to be used to transport harvested trees
from riparian and wetland setbacks.
            5.   Specify the erosion control Best Management Practices that
will be employed during and after the proposed harvest. These erosion control
practices shall be in conformance with the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Forestry's BMPs for Erosion Control on Logging Jobs in
Ohio.
            6.   Provide the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Ohio EPA
Wetland and Stream protection permit numbers and the associated permit
requirements.
      (2)   Streambank stabilization and erosion control measures. Streambank
stabilization and erosion control measures may be allowed provided that such
measures are ecologically compatible and substantially utilize natural
materials and native plant species where practical. The streambank
stabilization and erosion control measures shall only be undertaken upon
approval of an Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Plan by the Community.
      (3)   Crossings. Crossings of designated watercourses and through
riparian setbacks by publicly and privately owned roads, drives, sewer and/or
water lines and public and private utility transmission lines shall only be
allowed upon approval of a Crossing Plan by the Community Engineer. Such
crossings shall minimize disturbance in riparian setbacks watercourse substrate
and shall mitigate any necessary disturbances. Soil erosive materials will not
be used in making stream crossings.
      (4)   Construction of fencing. Construction of fencing shall be allowed
with the condition that reasonable efforts be taken to minimize the destruction
of existing vegetation, provided that the fence does not impede stream or flood
flow, and the disturbed area is replanted to the natural or preexisting
conditions before the addition of the fence, as approved by the Community
Engineer. (Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-15-08.)
1361.13 USES PROHIBITED IN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   Any use not authorized under these regulations shall be prohibited in
riparian and wetland setbacks. By way of example, the following uses are
specifically prohibited; however, prohibited uses are not limited to those
examples listed here.
   (a)   Construction. There shall be no structures of any kind.
   (b)   Dredging or Dumping. There shall be no drilling, filling, dredging, or
dumping of soil, spoils, liquid, or solid materials, except for non-commercial
composting of uncontaminated natural materials, and except as permitted under

1361.14 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES OR USES IN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   A non-conforming use within a riparian and wetland setback which is in
existence at the time of passage of this regulation, and which is not otherwise
permitted under these regulations, may be continued. However, the use shall not
be changed or enlarged unless it is changed to a use permitted under these
regulations.
   (b)   A non-conforming structure within a riparian and wetland setback which
is in existence at the time of passage of this regulation, and which is not
otherwise permitted under these regulations, may be continued. However, the
existing building footprint or roofline may not be expanded or enlarged in such
a way that would move the structure closer to the stream or wetland.
   (c)   A non-conforming structure or use or deteriorated structure within a
riparian and wetland setback which is in existence at the time of passage of
this regulation, and which is discontinued, terminated, or abandoned for a
period of six (6) months or more, may not be revived, restored, or re-
established. This section shall not apply to a residence that is vacant and
which is not subject to condemnation orders by the Building Commissioner. This
section shall also not prohibit ordinary repairs to a residence or residential
accessory building that are not in conflict with other provisions in this
regulation.
   (d)   A non-conforming structure or use that is discontinued may be resumed
any time within six (6) months from such discontinuance but not thereafter. No
change or resumption shall be permitted that is more detrimental to riparian
and wetland setbacks, as measured against the intent and objectives of these
regulations as determined by the Community, than the existing or former non-
conforming structure or use.
   (e)   In the case of a non-conforming structure within a riparian or wetland
setback, the Community will allow a ten (10) foot maintenance access zone
measured perpendicular to the structure, to temporarily extend further into the
setback as long as disturbance to existing vegetation is minimized and
vegetation is restored to the pre-existing state, as near as practical, upon
completion. If any soil disturbance in a wetland will occur as part of any such
maintenance activity, a permit from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers or the
Ohio EPA, as appropriate, must be submitted prior to the onset of the soil
disturbing activity.
   (f)   In the case of a non-conforming residential structure, the Community
Engineer may allow minor upgrades to the structure that extend further into the
riparian setback, such as awnings and pervious decks/patios, provided the
modifications do not extend more than ten (10) feet further toward the
watercourse than the original foundation of the structure existing at the time
of passage of this regulation, and further provided that the modification will
not impair the function of the riparian zone nor destabilize any slope nor
stream bank, as determined by the Community Engineer. (Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-
15-08.)
1361.15 VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN AND WETLAND SETBACKS.
   (a)   The Community may grant a variance from this regulation as provided
herein. In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship or practical
difficulty such as to justify the granting of a variance, the Community shall
consider the potential harm or reduction in riparian and/or wetland area
functions that may be caused by a proposed structure or use.
   (b)   In making a variance determination, the Community shall consider the
following:
      (1)   Varying the front, rear and side yard setback before the riparian
and wetland setbacks are varied.
      (2)   Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete paving in
the riparian and wetland setbacks in any situation where gravel or porous
pavement (i.e., porous pavers, and similar products) will do the job.
   (c)   In making a variance determination, the Community may consider the
following:
      (1)   A parcel existing at the time of passage of this chapter is made
unbuildable.
      (2)   The soil type and natural vegetation of the parcel, as well as the
percentage of the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of
the Community's flood damage prevention regulations may be used as guidance
when granting variances in the 100-year floodplain.
      (3)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, soil erosion control, sediment control, water quality protection, or
other functions of the riparian and/or wetland area. This determination shall
be based on sufficient technical. and scientific data.
      (4)   The degree of hardship this regulation places on the landowner, and
the availability of alternatives to the proposed activity.
      (5)   Soil disturbing activities permitted in a riparian and/or wetland
setback through variances should be implemented in order to minimize clearing
to the extent possible, and to include Best Management Practices necessary to
minimize soil erosion and maximize sediment control.
      (6)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in riparian setback areas compromises their benefits
to the Community.
      (7)   A reduction in storm water infiltration into the soil in wetland
areas will occur.
      (8)   A requested above ground fence does not increase the existing area
of mowed grass or lawn.
      (9)   Modifying parking requirements before varying the riparian setback.
      (10)   Modifying building shape, size or design to avoid or minimize
intrusion into the riparian setback.
       (11)   In the case of a lot made unbuildable by this regulation,
consider the minimum variance needed to make it buildable for an appropriately
sized and compatibly designed structure, while following the guidance provided
in this section.
      (12)   Whether the variance will increase the likelihood for flood or
erosion damage to either the applicant's property or to other properties.
      (13)   Culverting of watercourses should be avoided.
      (14)   Whether the variance will result in the need for artificial slope
or bank stabilization measures that could interfere with the function of the
riparian zone. (Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-15-08.)
1361.16 BOUNDARY INTERPRETATION AND APPEALS PROCEDURE.
   (a)   When an applicant or his or her designated representative disputes the
boundary of a riparian or wetland setback or the ordinary high water mark of a
watercourse, the applicant or his or her designated representative shall submit
documentation to the Community which describes the boundary, the applicant's
proposed boundary, and justification for the proposed boundary change.
   (b)   The Community shall evaluate this documentation and shall make a
written determination within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed sixty
(60) days, a copy of which shall be submitted to the applicant. If during this
evaluation the Community requires further information, it may be required of
the applicant. In the event that the Community requests such additional
information, the sixty (60) day limit on the Community's review shall be
postponed until the applicant provides such information.
   (c)   Any party aggrieved by any wetland or riparian setback determination
under this regulation may appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals,
(Ord. 2008-13. Passed 4-15-08.)

1363.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)    Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.
   (b)    Findings of Fact. The Village of Newburgh Heights has special flood
hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)    Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)    Protect human life and health;
      (2)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)    Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)    Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11 )   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)    Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)    Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
      (4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)    Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Newburgh Heights as identified in Section
1363.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the Village of Newburgh Heights.
   (f)    Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)    Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010.
      (2)    Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)    Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Newburgh Heights as required by Section
1363.04(c), Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Village Hall at 4000 Washington Park Boulevard,
Newburgh Heights, Ohio.
   (g)    Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)    Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)    Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)    Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Newburgh Heights, any officer or employee thereof, or
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

order issued by President Carter in 1977; this order requires that no federally
assisted activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified
special flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)    "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" means the agency with
the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance
Program.
   (j)   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)    "Flood" or "Flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (1)    "Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)" is usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)    "Flood Insurance Rate Map" means an official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)    "Flood Insurance Risk Zones" are zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:
   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.

   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
         Zone AO:
   Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood
depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths
are determined.

depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
         Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
   Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   "Flood Insurance Study (FIS)" means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   "Flood Protection Elevation (FPE)" means the base flood elevation. In
areas where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the
flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)    "Freeboard" means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above
a flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)    "Historic structure" means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily

individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or

places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)    "Hydrologic and Hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)    "Letter of Map Change" means an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and
Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).
   A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
   A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes,
shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway
delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a
determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by
fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the
special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).
   A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project
complies with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain
management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)    "Lowest Floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)    "Manufactured Home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.

Administrative Code Section 3701-27-01, any tract of land upon which three or
more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of charge
or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the. roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)    "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" means a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)    "New construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village
of Newburgh Heights Flood Insurance Rate Map, June 1, 1979, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)    "Person" includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
General Assembly, the Controlling Board, the Adjutant General's Department, or
any court.
   (bb)    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is:
      (1)    Built on a single chassis,
      (2)    400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)    Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)    Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)    "Registered Professional Architect" means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C.
4703.01 to 4703.19.
   (dd)    "Registered Professional Engineer" means a person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)    "Registered Professional Surveyor" means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)    "Special Flood Hazard Area" or "Areas of Special Flood Hazard" means
the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)    "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home,
or gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)    "Substantial Damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent
with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Village of Newburgh Heights flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1363.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)    Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.    For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1363.04(c).
         B.    It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical
data, required in accordance with Section
1363.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.    The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.    Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1363.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)    Right to Submit New Technical Data. Floodplain development permits
issued by the Floodplain Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant
obtaining a Letter of Map Revision from FEMA for any development proposal
subject to Section
1363.03(j)(1)A.
      (3)    Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Newburgh Heights have been modified by annexation or the community
has assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that
the Village of Newburgh Heights Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent
the Village of Newburg Heights boundaries, include within such notification a
copy of a map of the Village of Newburgh Heights suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village
of Newburgh Heights has assumed or relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
   (k)    Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)    In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.    Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the
FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all
previously existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of
administering these regulations.
         B.    Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by
FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no
base flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1363.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (1)    Substantial Damage Determinations. Substantial damage determinations
to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood, tornado,
wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the Floodplain
Administrator shall:

the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.    Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1363.04(i)(1)B. items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)    Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.    The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.    Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.    The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Newburgh Heights specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.    The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1363.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)    Variances. Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)    Application for a Variance.
         A.    Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the

statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals . Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.    The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or. conflict with existing local laws.
         D.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)    Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1363.05(d)(2)A. through K. have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
         C.    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.

party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)    Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
