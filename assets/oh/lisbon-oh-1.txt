continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is

101.06   CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of the Council, one amendment without reference to another, the
amendments are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to
each. If the amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of
enactment prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted
by an earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
101.07   DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of the Legislative Authority, may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
101.08   SEVERABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99   GENERAL PENALTY.
   (a)   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500), a term of imprisonment not
exceeding six months, or both. A separate offense shall be deemed committed
each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.
   (b)   The failure of any officer or employee of the municipality to perform
any official duty imposed by the Codified Ordinances shall not subject the
officer or employee to the penalty imposed for a violation unless a penalty is
specifically provided for such failure.

103.01   RETENTION OF OVERPAYMENT MONIES.
   (a)   The refunding by the Village of small amounts of overpayments by

expenses and other costs to the Village; costs which the State Auditor has
advised, may be avoided by the adoption of a retention ordinance.
   (b)   The Council desires to preserve Village monies and increase efficiency
of governmental operations and therefore ordains that any overpayment to a
department of the Village not exceeding ten dollars ($10.00) shall be retained
by the department and placed in the appropriate account.
(Ord. 1653. Passed 9-11-2000.)
103.02   CHARGE ON RETURNED CHECKS.
   The Village shall assess a charge of twenty five dollars ($25.00) on each
and every check returned to the Village for insufficient funds as well as for
any other reason for which said check or checks may be returned.
(Ord. 1614. Passed 5-10-99.)
103.03   CREDIT CARD POLICY.
   The Village of Lisbon hereby approves and adopts the following credit card
policy.
   (a)   The Village has been issued credit cards as a convenience for making
Village work related purchases. Work related purchases are any cost of
expenditure of Village funds authorized and/or approved in advance and related
to the official business of the Village.
   (b)   Only the Fiscal Officer or Fiscal Officer's designee are authorized
signers for the use of the Village credit card.
   (c)   When not in use, the credit card(s) shall be in the possession and
control of the Village Fiscal Officer and shall be stored in a secure location.
   (d)   The Fiscal Officer shall maintain log sheets signed by the person
utilizing the credit cards. Said log sheets shall reflect the date and time the
credit card is signed out along with the date and time that the credit card is
returned to the Fiscal Officer.
   (e)   The transaction dollar amount for any single charge is seventeen
thousand five hundred dollars ($17,500) and the total spending limit on the
Village credit card shall be seventeen thousand five hundred dollars ($17,500).
Only purchases within these dollar limits and approved budgetary constraints
may be made using the Village credit card.
   (f)   Receipts: The following payment review and approval procedures must be
adhered to:
      (1)   Detailed invoices or receipts are required for all transactions
using the Village credit card.
      (2)   Invoices and receipts must show the transaction date, the dollar
amount of the transaction, and a description of the transaction (service items
purchased and an authorized signature).
      (3)   All such paperwork must be submitted to the Village Fiscal Officer
no later than five business days after completing the transaction, unless
otherwise authorized.
   (g)   The issuance, reissuance and/or cancellation of credit cards must be
approved by Village Council.
   (h)   Any lost and/or stolen credit cards shall be reported immediately to
the Fiscal Officer.

cards and accounts issued, the number of active credit cards and accounts
issued, the credit cards and account's expiration date and the account's credit
limits.
   (j)   The Fiscal Officer or the Fiscal Officer's designee shall annually
file a report with Village Council detailing all the rewards received based
upon the use of the Village's credit card account.
   (k)   The Village shall not hold or utilize a debit card account, except for
law enforcement purposes. Possession or use of a debit card account by a
political subdivision except for law enforcement purposes is a violation of
R.C. § 2913.21.

146.02   ESTABLISHMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL AND HISTORIC BOARD OF REVIEW.
   There is hereby established an Architectural and Historic Board of Review in
and for the Village with the powers and duties set forth in this chapter.
(Ord. 1316. Passed 8-25-88.)
146.03   PURPOSE OF BOARD.
   (a)   Generally. The purpose of the Architectural and Historic Board of
Review is to maintain a high character of community development and to protect
the public safety, convenience, and welfare. Such purpose shall include
maintaining accepted and recognized design standards, use of materials,
finished grade lines, dimensions, orientation and location of all main and
accessory buildings to be constructed, moved, altered, remodeled, repaired,
painted, signed, or re-signed, subject to the design standards provided for in
division (c) hereof. In reviewing, regulating and approving building plans, the
Board shall consider and take cognizance of the development of neighboring
buildings and properties for the purpose of achieving safe, harmonious, and
integrated development of related properties.
   (b)   Historic Districts and/or Landmarks. Council hereby finds and
determines that the establishment of restrictions on the construction,
erection, alteration, painting, signing, re-signing, removal, moving or
demolition of buildings and structures in areas of historic significance, and
on the alteration, removal, painting, signing, re-signing, moving or demolition
of buildings and structures of historic significance, is vital to the
preservation of the educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of the
Municipality and its residents. Council further finds and determines, on the
basis of the Village Architectural and Historical Study, that the following
purposes will be served by the establishment of such restrictions by this
chapter:
      (1)   Promotion of the use and preservation of historic buildings,
structures and sites which reflect the cultural, social, economic, political,
or architectural heritage of the Municipality for the education and general
welfare of the residents of the Municipality;
      (2)   Protection and enhancement of the attractiveness of the
Municipality as it relates to residents, tourists, and visitors, serving as a
support and stimulant to business and thereby strengthening the economy of the
Municipality and its residents;
      (3)   Compatibility of any and all construction of new improvements and
buildings and modifications of existing structures with the historic
architectural character of the Municipality;
      (4)   Enhancement of the visual and aesthetic character, diversity, and
interests of the Municipality; and
      (5)   Preservation and further enhancement of civic pride of the
residents of the Municipality in the beauty of the Municipality and in the
notable accomplishments of the past.
   (c)   Design Standards Adopted. Council hereby adopts the following design
standards to serve the purposes set forth in division (b) hereof:
      (1)   General: All buildings that are to be built, repairs, modified or
added to shall be done in such a way as to retain and preserve the existing
historical character of the Village. Existing buildings that have been built in
recent years, and clearly were designed and built in such a way as not to blend
with the original Village character shall attempt to stay in visual background
as much as possible. This can be done with eliminating "loud" colors, large
internally lit plastic signs, etc. Landscaping can also be an effective tool
for this purpose.
      (2)   Store Fronts: Store fronts shall be restored to their original
character using photographs, drawings, and other available information to
determine the original features. When a reliable record of the original design
is unavailable, a design shall be developed that is in harmony with the overall
Village character and, in particular, with adjacent buildings. Particular
features of store fronts that are considered important in overall character of
the exterior are:
         A.   Display windows;
         B.   Signs;
         C.   Transoms;
         D.   Doors;
         E.   Entablatures;
         F.   Upper story windows.
      (3)   Government Buildings: Government buildings shall be restored and
maintained in the original character. Where applicable, masonry should be
cleaned and painted surfaces repainted. Attention to landscaping, walks, lawns,

building in the Downtown Historic District, or for the alteration, removal,
painting, signing or resigning, moving or demolition of any historic landmark,
shall be issued where such action will affect the exterior architectural
features of any such structure or building, unless and until a certificate of
appropriateness has been issued by the Architectural and Historic Board of
Review. The building owner and/or contractor must apply to the Board for such
certificate for referral at its next regular meeting. Application shall be made
at least twenty days prior to such meeting and shall include all related plans
and specifications. Applications may be secured from the office of the Mayor's
Secretary.
   (b)   At the first regular or special meeting of the Board after receipt of

materials for any such proposed construction, erection, alteration, painting,
signing or re-signing, removal, moving or demolition, the Board shall consider
the application and determine whether or not to approve the same. If the

certificate of appropriateness to the owner and/or contractor for the requested
construction, erection, alteration, painting, signing or resigning, removal,
moving or demolition. The Board shall notify the applicant of the date and time
his or her application will be considered.
   (c)   In determining whether or not a certificate of appropriateness will be
issued, the Board shall consider whether or not the proposed change will affect

structure, whether or not it is inappropriate or inconsistent with the spirit
and purpose of this chapter and whether or not it will affect adversely or
destroy the general historic and architectural significance of the District.
The Board shall also examine any other consideration specifically listed and
adopted by Council. With respect to any proposed demolition, the Board shall
determine whether or not preservation is economically feasible for the
applicant, and shall issue a certificate of appropriateness if failure to do so
would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or building
involved. If, at the next regular meeting of the Board, the Board recommends
that the certificate of appropriateness not be issued, it shall advise the
applicant of any change necessary to secure the approval of the Board and shall
withhold denial of the certificate of appropriateness for a period not to
exceed twenty days in order that the applicant may adopt such proposed change.

specifications as provided, the Board shall submit, in writing, its
recommendations to the owner and/or contractor and, if then approved, shall
issue the certificate of appropriateness to authorize the construction,
erection, alteration, painting, signing or re-signing, removal, moving or
demolition. The written report shall include the location of the proposed work,
the exterior changes contemplated, the findings of the Board and/or its
recommendations as to the grant or refusal of the certificate of

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
            
Chap. 171.   Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
Editor’s note: The ability of a Mayor to preside over a Mayor’s Court was
significantly affected by DePiero v. City of Macedonia, 180 F.3d 770 (6th Cir.
1999), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 844 (2000). The DePiero case essentially put
all municipalities on notice that a defendant’s due process rights may be
violated each time the Mayor presides over the Mayor’s Court. Such notice
suggests that a Mayor presiding over Mayor’s Court after June 23, 1999 (the
date of issuance of the opinion) could be personally liable to such a defendant
for compensatory and punitive damages. As a result of this case, many
municipalities now have a Magistrate preside over their Mayor’s Court pursuant
to Ohio R.C. 1905.05. Please consult your Village Attorney if you have any
questions regarding the impact of this case.

192.012   PURPOSES OF TAX; RATE.
   (a)   To provide funds for the purpose of general municipal operations,
maintenance of equipment, new equipment, extension, enlargement and improvement
of municipal services and facilities and capital improvements of the Village,
there shall be and hereby is levied a tax on and after January 1, 2020 upon the
earnings at the rate of 2.0% upon the following:
      (1)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions, and other
compensation earned and/or received by resident individuals of the Village.
         A.   For clarification "income" includes, but is not limited to,
lottery, gambling and sports winnings, and games of chance.
         B.   If the taxpayer is considered a professional gambler for Federal
income tax purposes, related deductions as permitted by the Internal Revenue
Code shall be allowed against gambling and sports winnings.
         C.   If the taxpayer is not considered a professional gambler for
Federal income tax purposes, a deduction equal to the amount of income combined
from lottery, gambling and sports winnings, and games of chance shall be
allowed, provided that in no case shall the deduction exceed five thousand
dollars ($5,000). If said income is payable to the taxpayer in more than one
year, the deduction applies only in the first year in which the income is
received.
      (2)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions, and other
compensation earned and/or received by nonresident individuals of the Village.
Separation pay, termination pay, reduction-in-force pay, and other compensation
paid as a result of an employee leaving the service of an employer shall be
allocable only to the Village.
         A.   The Village shall not, however, tax the compensation of a non-
resident individual who will be deemed to be an occasional entrant if all of
the following apply:
            1.   The compensation is paid for personal services performed by
the individual in the Village on twelve or fewer days during the calendar year,
in which case the individual shall be considered an occasional entrant for
purposes of the Village income tax. A day is a full day or any fractional part
of a day.
            2.   In the case of an individual who is an employee, the principal
place of business of the individual's employer is located outside the Village
and the individual pays tax on compensation described in this chapter to the
municipality, if any, in which the employer's principal place of business is
located, and no portion of that tax is refunded to the individual.
            3.   The individual is not a professional entertainer or
professional athlete, the promoter of a professional entertainment or sports
event, or an employee of such a promoter, all as may be reasonably defined by
the Village.
         B.   Beginning with the thirteenth day an individual deemed to have
been an occasional entrant to the Village performs services within the Village,
the employer of said individual shall begin withholding the Village income tax
from remuneration paid by the employer to the individual, and shall remit the
withheld income tax to the Village in accordance with the requirements of this
chapter. Since the individual can no longer be considered to have been an
occasional entrant, the employer is further required to remit taxes on income
earned in the Village by the individual for the first twelve days.
         C.   If the individual is self-employed, it shall be the
responsibility of the individual to remit the appropriate income tax to the
Village.
      (3)   On the net profits attributable to the Village by all resident
unincorporated businesses, associations, professions or other activities,
derived from work done or services performed or rendered and business or other
activities conducted in the Village.
      (4)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned
and/or received by a resident individual, partner or owner or part owner of a
resident unincorporated business entity or association attributable to the
Village and not levied against such unincorporated business entity. On behalf
of each owner, partner, or shareholder, the tax due on the distributive shares
shall be collected and remitted by the resident and non-resident unincorporated
businesses, professions and other entities in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter and the rules and regulations.

nonresident unincorporated businesses, associations, professions or other
activities, derived from work done or services performed or rendered and
business or other activities conducted in the Village.

behalf of each owner, partner, or shareholder, the tax due on the distributive
shares shall be collected and remitted by the resident and non-resident
unincorporated businesses, professions and other entities in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations.
      (7)   Effective for tax years 2004 and later, the distributive share of
income paid to an S corporation shareholder shall be taxable in the following
manner:
         A.   If no portion of the net profits of the S corporation are
allocated or apportioned to the State of Ohio, the distributive share is
taxable only to the extent that it represents wages or net earnings from self-
employment.
         B.   If any portion of the net profits of the S corporation are
allocated or apportioned to the State of Ohio, the full amount of the
distributive share is taxable.
   (b)   Exemptions. The tax provided for herein shall not be levied upon:

average ratio of:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all the real
and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or

period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village to salaries, and other compensation paid during the same period

services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
      (4)   In the event the foregoing allocation formula in divisions (a)(1)
through (a)(3) of this section does not produce an equitable result, another
basis (including the books and records method) may be substituted in an effort
to achieve an equitable result.
   (b)   As used in this chapter, "sales made in the Village" means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Village.

the Village regardless of where title passes even though transported from a
point outside of the Village if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its
own employees in the solicitation of promotion of sales within the Village and
the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village to purchasers outside the Village regardless of where

reason of transaction with stockholders or with other corporations related by
stock ownership, interlocking directorates, or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he
shall make such allocation as he deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper
allocation of net profits to the Village.

   (a)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section 192.052 or division (d) or (f) of this section. An employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (a)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (b)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         A.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)B. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day each calendar
quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of
taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf
of the municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars ($200.00). Payments under division (b)(1)B. of this section
shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the
last day of each month.
         C.   On or before the last day of February of each year all
individuals, businesses, employers, brokers or other who engage persons, either
on a fee or commission basis or as independent contractors and not employees
(those who are not subject to withholding) must provide the Village with copies
of all 1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms and/or a list of names, addresses,
Social Security numbers or Federal identification numbers and a total amount of
earnings, payments, bonuses, commissions and/or fees paid to each person.
      (2)   All employers that provide any contractual service within the
Village, and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service shall,

addresses of the subcontractors. The subcontractors shall be responsible for
all income tax employer requirements under this chapter.
      (3)   The officer or employee having control or supervision, or charged
with the responsibility of withholding the tax, filing the return and/or making
the payment, shall be personally liable for the failure to file the return or
pay the tax due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy, or
reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to file a return or
pay taxes due.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section 192.091.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division

location for more than twenty days.
         C.   The employee is a resident of the municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
192.051.
         D.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional entertainer,
or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the performance of
services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure within the municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has

remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         D.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (b)
(2)C. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (b)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
192.03. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
192.051.
   (g)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (d) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum

corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The Administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (e)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (e) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with R.C. § 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (f)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty percent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each return not filed
or filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld
at the rate prescribed in R.C. § 5703.47.
   (i)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section 192.07. This division applies only to the person for whom the amount is
deducted and withheld.
   (j)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

Section
192.03(c)(30).
         B.   "Adjusted Federal taxable income" is defined in Section
192.03(c)(1).

the municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C.
Chapter 5745.
   (a)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
192.052;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (b)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (a) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         A.   Separate accounting;
         B.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         C.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipality;
         D.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
192.19(a).
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
192.19(a).
      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (c)   As used in division (a)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         A.   The employer;
         B.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

division (c)(1)B. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (d)   For the purposes of division (a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:

         A.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         B.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a
location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (e)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
         A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located,
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
192.081.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted
      from taxation under Section
192.03(c)(16)L. and (c)(44)A.4., by a municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add
the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (h)   When calculating the ratios described in division (a) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (b) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

      (3)   An election made under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
            When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under R.C. § 718.80, a
valid election made by the taxpayer under division (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this
section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of the five-year
period.
            When an election made under R.C. § 718.80 is terminated, a valid

intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is

division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
192.03(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
192.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
192.062, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
192.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

make the computations required under Section 192.062 by substituting
"consolidated Federal taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from"
wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by substituting
"affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears
in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

192.091(g) or on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the first
taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         D.   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first
month of the following taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for
the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the
fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety percent of the
tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in division (c)(1)A.
through D. of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with R.C. § 718.05.
         A.   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and
are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due
on the same date as the filing of the Federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of R.C. § 5747.08.
         B.   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to R.C. § 718.27 upon
the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless the
underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of this
section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
municipal corporation under Section
192.091 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.
   A municipal corporation may, by ordinance or rule, waive the requirement for
filing a declaration of estimated taxes for all taxpayers.

192.08   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID
192.081   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Village who receives net
profits, income, qualifying wages, commissions or other personal service
compensation for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the
Village, if it be made to appear that he had paid a municipal income tax on the
same income taxable under this chapter to another municipality, shall be
allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter of the amount so paid
by him or in his behalf to such other municipality. The credit shall not exceed
the tax assessed by this chapter on such income earned in such other
municipality or municipalities where such tax is paid.
   (b)   No credit is given for payments of school district income tax.
(Ord. 1848. Passed 2-9-2009; Ord. 1981. Passed 12-15-2015; Ord. 1992. Passed

192.082   REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

192.083   CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under R.C. § 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
R.C. § 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
192.081.
(Ord. 1981. Passed 12-15-2015; Ord. 1992. Passed 11-8-2016; Ord. 2007. Passed
12-12-2017.)
192.084   CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
192.096.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
192.096, the municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
municipality claims is due. If the municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carry-forward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
192.096.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
192.081 regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 1981. Passed 12-15-2015; Ord. 1992. Passed 11-8-2016; Ord. 2007. Passed
12-12-2017.)
192.09   ANNUAL RETURN
192.091   RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
municipal taxable income by the municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the municipality under Section
192.051(c) when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to
the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the municipality.
      (3)   All resident individual taxpayers, eighteen years of age and older,
shall file an annual municipal income tax return with the municipality,
regardless of income or liability.
   (b)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (e)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's Federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040 or, in the case of a return or request required by a qualified
municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a
portal provided by municipality. The Department of Taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The Department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of R.C. § 5747.08. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the municipality or Tax Administrator.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
192.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section
192.092, the provision in Section
192.092 prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the
municipality an annual net profit return under division (f)(3) and (f)(4) of
this section.
   (i)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
Section
192.051(b)(1)B.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
192.051 shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
192.052.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
               The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

192.092   RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (a)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An
applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers
necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. Except as provided in division (b)(3) of this section, the
Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator
considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipality before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (b)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (c)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (a) and (b) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (c)(2)A.
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian

Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,

      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any Federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or state income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
192.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.

that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less,
no refund need be paid by the municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth
in division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
192.096. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

withholding tax levied by the municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
192.18.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
192.10(a)(4).

   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice

necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was

such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and Federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.

records, or Federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

document requiring the identifying information.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
192.10, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
192.99.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (a) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
192.10.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
192.99 for a violation of Section

192.16   OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (c)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of Federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
Federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to Federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
192.15.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) of this section may not be
appealed.
(Ord. 1981. Passed 12-15-2015; Ord. 1992. Passed 11-8-2016; Ord. 2007. Passed
12-12-2017.)
192.17   ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 1981. Passed 12-15-2015; Ord. 1992. Passed 11-8-2016; Ord. 2007. Passed
12-12-2017.)
192.18   LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the municipality. This member may be an employee of
the municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in R.C. §
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the
hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the Board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under R.C. § 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to R.C. § 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.

192.19   ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
192.18. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Local Board of Tax Review
with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
192.096.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
192.18, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section
192.096, with interest on that amount as provided by division (d) of this
section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

192.60    MUNICIPAL INCOME TAX NET OPERATING LOSS REVIEW COMMITTEE.
   (a)   There is hereby created the Municipal Income Tax Net Operating Loss
Review Committee for the purpose of evaluating and quantifying the potential
fiscal impact to municipal corporations levying an income tax of requiring such
municipal corporations to allow taxpayers to carry forward net operating losses
for five years. The Committee is a public body for the purposes of R.C. §
121.22.
   (b)   The Committee shall be composed of the following members:
      (1)   Two members of the House of Representatives who are not of the same

      (2)   Two members of the Senate who are not of the same political party,
appointed by the President of the Senate;
      (3)   Three members representing municipal income taxpayers, appointed by
the Speaker of the House of Representatives;
      (4)   Three members representing municipal corporations that levy an
income tax in calendar year 2016, appointed by the President of the Senate. At
least two of the members appointed under division (b)(4) of this section shall
represent municipal corporations that do not allow taxpayers to carry forward
net operating losses to future taxable years.
      (5)   One member appointed by the Governor, who shall serve as the
chairperson of the committee.
   An appointed member shall serve until the member resigns or is removed by
the member's appointing authority. Vacancies shall be filled in the same manner
as original appointments. A vacancy on the Committee does not impair the right
of the other members to exercise all the functions of the Committee.
   The Committee shall meet at the call of the chairperson. The presence of a
majority of the members of the Committee constitutes a quorum for the conduct
of business of the Committee. The concurrence of at least a majority of the
members of the Committee is necessary to approve the report issued by Committee
under division (d) of this section. Members of the Committee shall not be
compensated or reimbursed for members' expenses.
   (c)   (1)   As used in this section, "reporting municipal corporation" means
any municipal corporation that does not allow net operating losses incurred
before January 1, 2017, to be carried forward and utilized to offset income or
net profit generated in such municipal corporation in future taxable years.
      (2)   On or before August 31, 2021, each reporting municipal corporation
shall report to the municipal income tax net operating loss review committee
the difference between (a) the municipal corporation's actual municipal income
tax revenue received for taxable years ending in 2018 and 2019 and (b) the
projected amount of municipal income tax revenue that the municipal corporation
would have received for taxable years ending in 2018 and 2019 if the municipal
corporation were not required to allow net operating losses incurred in prior
taxable years to be carried forward to taxable years ending in 2018 or 2019.
Each municipal corporation's calculations shall be made using the
microsimulation model adopted by the Committee at its meeting on May 5, 2016,
but applied to taxable years ending in 2018 and 2019.
   (d)   The Municipal Income Tax Net Operating Loss Review Committee shall
review the information reported by municipal corporations under division (c) of
this section and calculate total of the revenue effects reported by such
municipal corporations. On or before May 1, 2022, the Committee shall issue a
written report to the speaker and minority leader of the House of
Representatives and the president and minority leader of the Senate reporting
the Committee's findings and the estimated revenue impact of requiring
municipal corporations levying an income tax to allow net operating loss to be
carried forward for five years. The report shall contain recommendations to
address revenue shortfalls, which may include, but which shall not be limited
to, the use of supplemental funds from the local government fund to mitigate
those shortfalls.
   (e)   Nothing in this section delays or otherwise affects taxable years to
which division (E)(8) of R.C. § 718.01 applies as prescribed in that division.
   (f)   The Municipal Income Tax Net Operating Loss Review Committee shall
cease to exist on May 1, 2022.

taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other

(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items

fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor

         A.    Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other
than in accordance with division (a)(1) of this section or R.C. §§ 4513.61 to
4513.65.
      (2)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with the
requirements of this section.
   (f)   This section does not apply to any private residential or private
agricultural property that is established as a private tow-away zone in
accordance with division (h) of this section or R.C. § 4513.601.
   (g)   Whoever violates division (e) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(R.C. § 4513.60)
   (h)   Private Tow-away Zones.
      (1)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away
zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,
the times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in R.C. § 4505.101(B).
            6.   In order to comply with the requirements of division (h)(1)A.
of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(h) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow-away zone is located.
      (2)   A.   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established
as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (h). The vehicle owner and
the operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in R.C. § 4505.101. The owner or lienholder of a vehicle
that has been removed under this division (h), subject to division (h)(3) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with division (h)(7) of
this section.
         B.   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (h)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (h)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   A.   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (h)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under
division (h)(1) of this section. The towing service shall record the time and
date of the photographs taken under this division (h). The towing service shall
retain the photographs and the record of the time and date, in electronic or
printed form, for at least 30 days after the date on which the vehicle is
recovered by the owner or lienholder or at least two years after the date on
which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.
         B   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (h)
(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   A.    If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under division
(h)(2) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of removing the
vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation concerning all of the following:
            1.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color;
            2.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
            3.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
            4.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may
be recovered;
            5.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be
recovered.
         B.    The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed from private
property in the chief's jurisdiction that is established as a private tow-away
zone of which the chief has received notice under this division (h). The record
shall include all information submitted by the towing service. The chief shall
provide any information in the record that pertains to a particular vehicle to
a person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner, operator, or lienholder of the vehicle and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
      (6)   A.    When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three business days of the removal, the towing
service or storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause
a search to be made of either of the following to ascertain the identity of the
owner and any lienholder of the vehicle:
            1.   The records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles;
            2.   The records of any vendor or vendors, approved by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles, that are capable of providing real-time access to
owner and lienholder information.
         B.   The towing service or storage facility may search the National
Motor Vehicle Title Information System in order to determine the state in which
the vehicle is titled. The entity that provides the record of the owner and any
lienholder under this division shall ensure that such information is provided
in a timely manner.
         C.   Subject to division (h)(6)F. of this section, the towing service
or storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
            1.   Within five business days after the applicable entity provides
the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if the
vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner's and lienholder's last known address
by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by certified mail
with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service utilizing any form
of delivery requiring a signed receipt;
            2.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed 30 days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under division (h)(6)C.1. of this
section.
         D.   Sixty days after any notice sent pursuant to division (h)(6)C. of
this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under R.C. §
4505.101(B), may initiate the process for obtaining a certificate of title to
the motor vehicle as provided in that section.
         E.   A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a
signed receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible,
shall not obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to
the motor vehicle under R.C. § 4505.101(B).
         F.   With respect to a vehicle concerning which a towing service or
storage facility is not eligible to obtain title under R.C. § 4505.101, the
towing service or storage facility need only comply with the initial notice
required under division (h)(6)C.1. of this section.
      (7)   A.   The owner or lienholder of a vehicle that is removed under
division (h)(2) of this section may reclaim it upon both of the following:
            1.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title to the vehicle, a certificate of registration for the
motor vehicle, or a lease agreement;
            2.   Payment of the following fees:
               a.   All applicable fees established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25, except that the lienholder of
a vehicle may retrieve the vehicle without paying any storage fee for the
period of time that the vehicle was in the possession of the towing service or
storage facility prior to the date the lienholder received the notice sent
under division (h)(6)A.1. of this section;
               b.   If notice has been sent to the owner and lienholder as
described in division (h)(6) of this section, a processing fee of $25.
         B.   A towing service or storage facility in possession of a vehicle
that is removed under authority of division (h)(2) of this section shall show
the vehicle owner, operator, or lienholder who contests the removal of the
vehicle all photographs taken under division (h)(4) of this section. Upon
request, the towing service or storage facility shall provide a copy of all
photographs in the medium in which the photographs are stored, whether paper,
electronic, or otherwise.
         C.   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves
the vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the
vehicle shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the
motor vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action
under R.C. § 4513.611.
         D.   Upon presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced
by a certificate of title to the vehicle, a certificate of registration for the
motor vehicle, or a lease agreement, the owner of a vehicle that is removed
under authority of division (h)(2) of this section may retrieve any personal
items from the vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any

section, “personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the
vehicle.
      (8)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any vehicle from

303.09   WILLFULLY LEAVING VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief's territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper,
upon notification to the chief of such action and of the location of the place
of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, including an abandoned
junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief's or trooper's duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief
of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place. However, when such
a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be ordered into
storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a
commercial motor vehicle, the chief or state highway patrol trooper shall allow
the owner or operator of the vehicle the opportunity to arrange for the removal
of the motor vehicle within a period of time specified by the chief or state
highway patrol trooper. If the chief or state highway patrol trooper determines
that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of time, the
chief or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the chief shall designate
the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under
division (a) of this section and arranges for the removal of a motor vehicle by
a towing service, the towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the
location designated by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is
removed.
   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in R.C. § 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity of
the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner's or lienholder's last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal
and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by
a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of title to the motor vehicle,
a certificate of registration for the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement. Upon
presentation of proof of ownership evidenced as provided above, the owner of
the motor vehicle also may retrieve any personal items from the vehicle without
retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
         B.   For purposes of division (c)(2) of this section, "personal items"
do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief's records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the presentation, shall issue a salvage
certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer's or facility's own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72
hours without the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the chief of
a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation of the reason for leaving
the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (b)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (b) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.
         (ORC 4513.64)
303.10   STORAGE OF JUNK VEHICLES.
   (a)   (1)   For purposes of this section, “junk motor vehicle” means any
motor vehicle which is three years old or older; extensively damaged, such
damage including but not limited to any of the following: missing wheels,
tires, motor, or transmission; apparently inoperable; and having a fair market
value of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) or less, that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than 72 hours with the
permission of the person having the right to possession of the property, except
if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal processing facility
licensed under the authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 through 4737.12, or otherwise
regulated under authority of a political subdivision; or if the property on
which the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by
any governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the
possession of the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a
bona fide commercial operation; or if the motor vehicle is a collector's
vehicle.
      (2)   The Municipality shall not prevent a person from storing or
keeping, or restrict him or her in the method of storing or keeping, any
collector's vehicle on private property with the permission of the person
having the right to the possession of the property, except that the
Municipality may require a person having such permission to conceal, by means
of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain, or other suitable obstruction, any
unlicensed collector's vehicle stored in the open.
      (3)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal corporation,
a state highway patrol trooper, the Legislative Authority, or the zoning
authority may send notice, by certified mail with return receipt requested, to
the person having the right to the possession of the property on which a junk
motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk
motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other
suitable structure, or shall be removed from the property.
      (4)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in
the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of 30
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

displaying at least one flashing, rotating, or oscillating light visible under
normal atmospheric conditions from a distance of 500 feet to the front of the

313.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic

313.03   TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
313.04   SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow. A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
313.05   PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

impose upon the offender a fine of not more than $250.
         C.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been

R.C. § 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than $500. The court

if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with R.C. § 4511.98,
the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose
upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the violation
under division (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom division
(d)(1)A. of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (d)(1)A. of this section and the assessment of points under division
(d)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted
driving safety course, as described in R.C. § 4511.991. If the offender attends
and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offender's driver's license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (d)(1)B. and (d)(1)C. of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (a) of this section
within two years of the offense for which the course was completed. This
division does not apply with respect to any offender in the category of

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section

   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,

         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance with
this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a), (b)
or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I. or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state O.V.I., and,
if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

(1)I. or (a)(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever
violates division (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver's or occupational driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19 as a result of the
conviction or guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4511.191(F)(2).
      (3)   A.   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under Ohio R.C.
4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (ii) and if, within 60 days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio
R.C. 4511.19(G)(1), the court may sentence the offender as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4511.19(G)(3).
      (4)   If an offender's driver's or occupational driver's license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (h) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G) and if Ohio R.C. 4510.13 permits the court

must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).

independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be
distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any
other penalties provided by law, may order restitution pursuant to Section

of the vehicle before, during, or after committing the offense for which the
offender is sentenced under division (h) of this section.

vehicle after underage alcohol consumption and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (i)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. In addition to
any other sanction imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class six
suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial driver's license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(6). The court may
grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. §§
4510.021 and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an
ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period
of suspension as authorized under R.C. § 4510.022. If the court grants
unlimited driving privileges under R.C. § 4510.022, the court shall suspend any
jail term imposed under division (i)(1) of this section as required under that
section.
      (2)   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has

of this section or other equivalent offense or offenses, the offender is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the third degree. In addition to any other sanction imposed
for the offense, the court shall impose a class four suspension of the

of the offender's operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing
the violation of division (b) of this section.

alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court's indigent drivers' alcohol
treatment fund.

nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or Ohio R.C.
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person's trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (l)   Division (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the amount

prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (m)   The prohibited concentrations of a controlled substance or a
metabolite of a controlled substance listed in division (a)(1)J. of this
section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.16(D) in
the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of
the same term as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term as defined
in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 applies to this section.

in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect what were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:

from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (o)(3)A. of this section.

to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of
driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in division (b)(3)A.

or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.

noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

pursuant to Section
501.99(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially

within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on

this section in their possession while operating or occupying an automobile.
      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of division (c)(3) or (c)(4) of this section is immune from civil
liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant

      (1)   Subject to division (f)(2) of this section, the failure of a person
to wear all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant

or used as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence; shall not
diminish recovery for damages in any civil action involving the person arising
from the ownership, maintenance, or operation of an automobile; shall not be
used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other than a
prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible as
evidence in any civil or criminal action involving the person other than a

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that

339.01   LOAD LIMITS.
   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The Municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in R.C. §§ 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
R.C. §§ 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
339.02   USE OF LOCAL STREETS; LOCAL PERMIT AND CONDITIONS.

of five tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than state routes and
County roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked
as such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is
necessary to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of
storage of such vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act
other than passage through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating
from either a state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality
shall confine such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the
purpose of the departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated
local authority shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the
construction and material specifications for such roads and the load resistance
of such roads as determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be
posted with signs indicating such weight limits.
   (b)   Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (3)   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (4)   Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating “no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons” or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
      (5)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Section
303.99.
339.03   MAXIMUM WIDTH, HEIGHT AND LENGTH.

directions on the meter. Such person is not required to deposit a coin in a
meter which indicates a balance of unused legal parking time left by the
previous occupant of the space, so long as his occupancy of the space does not
exceed the indicated unused parking time. The parking meter space may be
lawfully occupied by such vehicle during the balance of legal parking time
shown on the meter provided such occupancy does not exceed the established
maximum time limit.

particular space occupied, by appropriate notice on the meter or on posted
signs, irrespective of the number or amount of coin deposited in such meter.

shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)
(3) of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the
following offenses during the following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years

         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this division:
         A.   The phrase “offense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),
2921.43(A) or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense
involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined to
match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or

and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (k)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section apply to a
violation of R.C. §
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that

committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of
those sections committed prior to July 16, 2015, if prosecution for that
violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (a)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and
applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.

501.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09   ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10   COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
501.99.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
533.99 or
501.99 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
501.99(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another characterized by a pattern of
repetitive, compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to
the consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section.
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
501.99(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under § 698.02(c), (d), (e), and
(f). A court may impose the longest jail term authorized under § 698.02(b) only
upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon offenders
whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses demonstrate
that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter the offender
from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim's representative, the victim's
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.

501.14   MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another State, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a
prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

501.15   MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   ( Editor's note: Section
501.15 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and revision of these Codified
Ordinances because substantially identical State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was
repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
501.16   SUSPENSION OF DRIVER’S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

501.17   SELF DEFENSE: LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” has the same meaning as in R.C. §
2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence if that person is in
a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.
   (c)   A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of retreat as a
factor in determining whether or not a person who used force in self-defense,
defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence reasonably believed
that the force was necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or
safety.
(R.C. § 2901.09)
501.99   GENERAL PENALTY.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the Municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section 533.99 or 501.13 of this code or R.C.
§ 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this section and unless another term
is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a
jail term on the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a
definite jail term that shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
         (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section 533.99 and 501.13 of this Code
or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is required by law, in
sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, the
sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,

entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender' occupation or care
for the offender' family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor, or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential

ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or the victim's estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim's representative, victim's attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor's designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim's costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim's representative, victim's attorney, if applicable, or victim's estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim's estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim's attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim's estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender's criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially similar municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.    Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.

determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, Ohio R.C. 955.11
(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and
the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog,
and Section
505.16 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and

basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,

from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.

the right of the accused to demand, and the manner in which the accused shall
demand, the testimony of the person signing the report.

analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The

portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.

multiple thereof, or who is accused of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, other than a minor misdemeanor
violation, that involves marihuana, is entitled, upon written request made to
the prosecuting attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the accused’s choice,
or, if the accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the
court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving

bingo session at the premises, or on the day of the week or at the time
specified on its license or if a charitable organization wants to conduct bingo
sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than the day or time specified
on its license, the charitable organization may apply in writing to the
Attorney General for an amended license pursuant to R.C. § 2915.08(J). A
charitable organization may apply twice in each calendar year for an amended
license to conduct bingo sessions on a day of the week or at a time other than
the day or time specified on its license. If the amended license is granted,
the organization may conduct bingo sessions at the premises, on the day of the

      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.

serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for juveniles.

discernibly turgid state.
   (h)   “Obscene.” When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest.

      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality.
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose.
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

child issued pursuant to the divorce and child custody laws of another State,
except to the extent that the order for support or for custody of a child is

offender will cause physical harm to the person or property of the other
person, the other person's unborn, or a member of the other person's immediate

organization that employs the other person or to which the other person
belongs.
      (2)   No person shall knowingly place or attempt to place another in
reasonable fear of physical harm or death by displaying a deadly weapon,

under this section or any other section of the Ohio Revised Code may be
prosecuted under this section, the other section of the Ohio Revised Code, or
both sections. However, if an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of this section and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of R.C. § 2903.13, or any substantially similar municipal ordinance,
based on the same conduct involving the same victim that was the basis of the

create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a
duty of care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care,

Ordinances. For current provisions, see Section

545.02   DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially similar municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially similar municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under R.C. § 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially similar municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. § 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.
   As used in this section, “fair market value” is the money consideration
which a buyer would give and a seller would accept for property or services,
assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell,
that both are fully informed as to all facts material to the transaction, and
that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
(ORC 2913.61(B) - (E))
545.03   DEGREE OF OFFENSE WHEN CERTAIN PROPERTY INVOLVED.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender previously has been convicted of a theft offense, a violation of
Section
545.05 or Section
545.18 is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law if the property
involved is any of the following:
   (a)   A credit card;
   (b)   A printed form for a check or other negotiable instrument, that on its
face identifies the drawer or maker for whose use it is designed or identifies

drawer or maker or on which the amount is blank;
   (c)   A motor vehicle identification license plate as prescribed by R.C. §

instruction permits specified in division (d)(1) of this section, the court in
its discretion may choose not to impose the suspension, revocation or denial

instead may require the offender to perform community service for a number of
hours determined by the court.

901.01   SUPERVISION AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   The Street Commissioner of the Village is hereby charged with the duty of
overseeing all sidewalks within the Village limits, which shall specifically
include inspection of existing sidewalks and reporting any necessary repairs to
Council, supervision of repairs or construction of new sidewalks and
establishing detailed specifications for sidewalks and the location of new
sidewalks. In establishing specifications for and location of specific
sidewalks, for purposes of repair or new construction, the Commissioner shall
attempt insofar as possible, to establish uniformity throughout the Village,
seeking maximum utility with a minimum of damage to the property and trees,
shrubbery, fences, etc. already located thereon. Unless special circumstances
justify different specifications in constructing new sidewalks, the
specifications shall call for concrete sidewalks of a minimum width of four
feet and a minimum depth of four inches, upon sound footing. In locating
sidewalks, the Commissioner shall not be limited to Village property or street
rights of way, but may specify locations upon private property.
901.02   REPAIRS.
   The Street Commissioner shall report all necessary repairs of specific
sidewalks, together with his recommendation thereon, to Council, Council may
provide for the repair and restoration thereof or any portion thereof at the
expense of the Village, or may direct the owner of the abutting property to
repair the same, according to the detailed specifications of the Commissioner.
901.03   NEW CONSTRUCTION.
   Council may designate by specific resolutions, from time to time, specific
areas within the Village where new sidewalks shall be constructed, pursuant to
the detailed specifications of the Street Commissioner. The resolution may
provide that the cost shall be borne by the Village in which case the
resolution shall call for proper advertisement for bids as provided by law or
the resolution may provide that the cost thereof be assessed against the owners
of the property bounding or abutting such sidewalks.
901.04   PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION; NOTICE; ASSESSMENT.
   If Council elects to assess the cost of the repair or construction of
sidewalks, it shall adopt a resolution specifying the particular sidewalks to
be repaired or constructed. Appropriate written notice of the resolution shall
thereupon be served upon the owner or agent of each parcel of land abutting on
the sidewalks by the Chief of Police or a deputy as provided in Ohio R.C.
729.02 and 729.03. If the owner of a parcel is a nonresident, notice of the
resolution shall be given by publication, as provided by Ohio R. C. 729. 03.
The notice shall state, if the indicated repairs are not made within thirty
days or the indicated construction is not completed within sixty days, or
within a reasonable extension thereof expressly granted by Village Council,
that the Village shall perform or contract for such repair and construction on
behalf of the owner and shall report and assess the cost or materials furnished
by the Village, or both. However, the cost of sidewalks abutting publicly owned
property and the costs of crossover or intersection sidewalks shall be paid by
the Village and no part thereof so assessed. Council may provide fox the
construction of sidewalks on only one side of a street or alley and it may
assess the cost thereof, equally or otherwise, upon the owners of the property
abutting on both sides of such street or alley. The assessed cost shall
constitute a lien on such property from the date the amount thereof is reported
to the owner and, if not paid to the Clerk-Treasurer within ten days
thereafter, the Clerk-Treasurer shall certify it, to the County Auditor, who
shall place it upon the tax duplicate and collect the same as provided by law.
901.05   SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.

providing for the repair and/or construction of sidewalks, and recovering the
cost thereof by special assessments, as provided by Ohio R.C. 727.01 et seq.
901.06   BUILDING OR FENCE ENCROACHMENT.
   No person shall obstruct any street, alley, sidewalk or public way by
erecting thereon any fence or building, or permitting any fence or building to
remain thereon. Each day that any such fence or building is permitted to remain
upon such public way shall be deemed a separate offense.
901.07   MATERIALS ON STREET OR SIDEWALK.
   No person shall encumber any street or sidewalk or, being the owner,
occupant or person having the care of any building or lot of land bordering on
any street or sidewalk, shall permit the same to be encumbered with barrels,
boxes, cans, articles, vegetation, obstructions or substances of any kind so as
to interfere with the free and unobstructed use thereof.
901.075   OBSTRUCTING VIEW OR FLOW OF TRAFFIC.
   (a)   No property owner or person in charge of any property abutting a
street, alley or roadway within the Village shall permit vegetation to grow or
any other matter to impair the view of individuals traveling upon the roadway
or impair the flow of traffic upon the roadway.
   (b)   In all cases where the police department determines that an impairment
of view or flow of traffic has occurred or that such an obstruction is a hazard
to public safety a warning letter shall go to property owner by certified mail
from the police department giving ten (10) days from the date of the receipt of
the letter to rectify the situation by removing the obstruction.
   (c)   Failure to respond and remove the obstruction by the property owner or
person in charge of the property within the time period allotted above shall
constitute a miscellaneous misdemeanor with a fine of $50 a day for every day
that the obstruction remains in place post the allotted time for removal.
   (d)   An imposition of the penalty described in division (c) of this section
shall not preclude the Village Municipal Attorney from instituting an
appropriate action or proceeding in law or inequity to restrain, correct, or
abate a violation of any provision of this section or to prevent the continued
violation of the same.

status of a public street or way prior to the effective date of this section

the exact location of the proposed opening, the kind of paving, the area and
depth to be excavated and such other facts as may be provided for. The cost of
the permit shall be ten dollars ($10.00), but the permit shall be issued only
after a cash deposit sufficient to cover the cost of restoration has been
posted with the Clerk-Treasurer, conditioned upon prompt and satisfactory
refilling of excavations and restoration of all surfaces disturbed. The amount

street opening permit.

excavation, restore the surface and remove all excess materials within the time
specified in the permit or, where not specified therein, within a reasonable
time after commencement of the work, the Village may proceed without notice to
make such fill and restoration and the deposit provided for in division (c)
hereof shall be deemed forfeited. Thereupon such deposit shall be paid into the
street repair fund of the Village, except such part demanded by and paid to the
permittee as the difference between the deposit and the charges of the Village
for restoration services performed by it. If the cost of such services
performed by the Village exceeds the amount of such deposit, the Clerk-
Treasurer shall proceed to collect the remainder due from such permittee.
   (e)   Barriers. No person engaged in or employing others in excavating or
opening any street, sidewalk, alley or other public way shall fail to have such
excavation or opening fully barricaded at all times to prevent injury to
persons or animals.

Affairs shall notify the Street Commissioner of any opening or closing of
Village streets or ways, but need not apply for a permit.

   (a)   The following User Charges and Debt Service Charges shall be paid, on
a bimonthly basis, by all classes of users (as defined in Section
925.05) throughout the service area, and the charges shall be based on each 100
cubic feet of flow being discharged to the sanitary sewer system.
 
All Classes User Charge             Debt Service Charge   Total
2021        $7.09 per 100 cu. ft.   $1.00 per 100 cu. ft. $8.09 per 100 cu. ft.
            3% increase on previous                       Total of user charge
Permanent   year user charge        $1.00 per 100 cu. ft. plus debt service per
                                                          100 cu. ft.
 
   (b)   A Minimum Bimonthly Charge of $6.00 per user is hereby established in
order to generate sufficient revenue to recover fixed costs associated with the
wastewater treatment works. The minimum amount of usage billed bi-monthly shall
be 200 cubic feet at a charge of $16.00. The same rate will apply to users
inside and outside the Village limits.
   (c)   Each industry discharging to the sanitary sewer system will complete
and file with the Village an industrial waste questionnaire containing
pertinent information as to quantity of flow, characteristics of discharged
wastewaters, etc., and this information will be used to determine billings for
the first year following the effective date of this chapter. Subsequent
billings will be based on revised information taken from annual updated reports
to be filed with the Public Utilities, or from other records. Interim reports
may be requested at the discretion of the Superintendent. New industries shall
file a fully executed questionnaire with the Village prior to being issued a
sewer permit.
   (d)   Where industrial wastewater is combined with sanitary wastewater at
the point or points of discharge, and no separate metering of each increment is
provided, the sanitary wastewater from industry shall be considered equal to 2
cubic feet or 15 gallons per day per employee (4 cubic feet, or 30 gallons per
day where showers are used) at “Normal Strength” loadings as previously defined
herein.
   (e)   The service charges, other than minimum charges, shall be computed on
the basis of the water purchased from the Village, as registered by the water
meter or meters, unless the actual quantity of wastewater entering the sanitary
sewer system can be determined, as specified hereinafter.
   (f)   Each premises served by the sanitary sewer system of the Village shall
be charged, and where a premises is served by more than one sewer connection a
combined charge shall be levied based on the total flow from all connections.
However, where the property is not occupied, a minimum charge shall be levied
for each sewer connection.
   (g)   Where more than one meter is installed, whether for the convenience of
the owner of the premises or the Village, service charges shall be rendered to
the owner of the premises for each meter, unless the combined flow through all
meters is authorized by the Superintendent.
   (h)   When a person, firm or corporation can show to the satisfaction of the
Board of Trustees that a portion of the water as measured by the water meter
(s) does not enter the sanitary sewer system, such as uncontaminated cooling
water, said person, firm or corporation may submit an application in writing to
the Board of Trustees for the installation of an auxiliary water meter. The
Board of Trustees have the authority to permit or to require an additional
meter (s) to be installed at the applicant's expense, so as to measure the
quantity of water actually entering the sanitary sewer system. The quantity of
water used to determine the service charges shall be the quantity of water
entering the sanitary sewer system as so determined.
   (i)   If the Superintendent finds that it is not practicable to measure such
water by meters, he shall determine the volume of wastewater in any manner or
method as he may find practicable, in order to arrive at the percentage of
metered water entering the sanitary sewer system and the quantity of water used
to determine the sewer service charges shall be that percentage so determined.
   (j)   In the event that the conditions set forth in division (h) above are
not, for any reason, met all water metered to the premises shall be used for
billing purposes.
   (k)   When premises are supplied either whole or in part with water from
wells or any source other than a public water supply, such wells or source of
supply shall be registered in writing with the Board of Trustees. The owner of
the premises shall install and maintain at his expense, a meter or meters
acceptable to the Village, on all such supplies, and the quantity of water used
to determine the service charges shall be the quantity as measured by the meter
or meters. If the meter or meters are not installed within six (6) months from
the date of notification in writing by the Board of Trustees, the owner or
other users of the premises shall be billed double the minimum charge.
   (l)   Where an auxiliary meter (or meters) is required for the proper
determination of water subject to the service charges, such meter shall be
installed only after approval has been granted by the Superintendent. Such
meters shall be installed, owned and maintained by the property owner. Venturi
meters, flumes, weirs and other methods of measuring flow shall be used only
when authorized by the Superintendent. It is understood that where an auxiliary
meter has been installed, such a meter shall not be removed without the
approval of the Superintendent.
   (m)   All meters shall be installed in accordance with the standards and
rules and regulations of the Village Public Utilities. Where private meters are
used on wells, or in an industrial water distribution system, and such meters
are set behind the primary water supply meter, the aforementioned standards,
rules and regulations may be modified or waived by the Board of Trustees.
   (n)   Fire protection service branches shall be exempt from all service
charges except for water used for purposes other than fire protection that may
be discharged to the sanitary sewer.
   (o)   Where a sanitary sewer in the area served by the Village of Lisbon is
available to any lot, parcel of land, building, or premises which is improved,
it is a conclusive presumption that wastewater from said lot, parcel of land,
building, or premises which is improved is discharged into such sewer, and the
owner shall be billed the service charges as provided herein. Any lot, parcel
of land, building, or premises abutting a street, alley, or easement in which
there is a public sanitary sewer shall be deemed to have available access to a
sanitary sewer, and the owner or other users of said real property shall
connect to said sewer within six (6) months from the date the owner is notified
in writing by the Board of Trustees that the sewer is made available for use to
their property. In the event the owner or other users of the real property are
not connected on said date, the charge specified under divisions (a) and (b) of
this section shall be imposed upon said property. Exceptions shall be as
specified under Section
927.04(d) of the Sewer Use Ordinance.
   (p)   The Water Department shall charge a flat rate surcharge of $2.50 per
month or $5.00 per billing cycle to each account using the services of the
Village Water Department.

Wastewater:
      (1)   Total Suspended Solids (Non-filterable Residue)
      (2)   BOD, 5 Days at 20 C.
   (b)   When any or all of the total suspended solids of BOD5 of a wastewater
accepted for admission to the Village's sanitary sewer system exceeds the
values of the above specified constituents or "Normal Strength" Wastewater, the
amount of the treatment surcharge to be paid will be based on the cost per
pound of removing the excess quantity of each constituent.
   (c)   Extra Strength User Surcharges are hereby established as follows:
      (1)   Suspended Solids $0.16 per lb.
      (2)   5-Day Biochemical Oxygen Demand $ 0.19 per lb.

facility may, at his own expense, construct such trunk and/or lateral facility
as directed by the Village. Upon completion of the facility to the satisfaction
of the Village such facility shall become the property of the Village and be
subject to all rules and regulations applicable. In the event a user is
required to construct a sewer line or other facility having a capacity in
excess of that needed by the user (minimum size is normally 8 inches in
diameter) , the Village shall reimburse the user who builds the sewer line or
facility in the amount equal to the amount of construction cost found necessary
to provide the excess capacity required by the Village.
   (f)   An Industrial Wastewater Surveillance Charge is hereby established of
$200 per year for each connection discharging industrial wastewater to the
sanitary sewer system. Where it has been reported that no industrial wastewater
is being discharged, a $50 charge may be levied only once per year to cover the
cost of verifying said report. The monies collected from this charge shall be
used to cover the cost of making surveys, record keeping, and occasional
analytical work necessary for verification of Owner reported results.

from the connection charges shall be deposited directly into the Sewer
Extension and Replacement Fund.
   (b)   The Board of Trustees shall review the user charges at least annually
and revise the rates, subject to City Council approval, as necessary to ensure
that adequate revenues are generated to pay the costs of operation and
maintenance (including replacement) and that the system continues to provide
for the proportional distribution of operation and maintenance including
replacement costs among users and user classes.
      (1)   The Board of Trustees shall recommend the schedule of charges no
later than the first regular meeting in October of the City Council for
ratification with the effective date of the ordinance to be January 1 of the
following year.
      (2)   The Village shall also inform each user at least annually, in
conjunction with a regular bill, of the rates and that portion of the user
charge that are attributable operation, maintenance, and replacement costs for
wastewater treatment services.
      (3)   The system shall be in accordance with the methods used to
establish the rates developed in the user charge system report approved by the
Ohio EPA and with the following requirements:
         A.   The system shall result in the distribution of the costs of
operation and maintenance of the wastewater system within the Department's
jurisdiction to each user class in proportion to such user's contribution to
the total wastewater loading of the treatment works. Factors such as strength,
volume, and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included
as the basis for the user's contribution to insure a proportional distribution
of operation and maintenance (including replacement) costs to each user class.
         B.   The system shall be reviewed annually and revised periodically to
reflect actual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs of the wastewater
system.
         C.   The system shall generate sufficient revenue to offset the costs
of all wastewater system operation and maintenance provided by the Department
and such other expenditures authorized by division (a) of this section,
including debt service requirements.
         D.   The cost of treating and handling the extra constituents of BOD5
and suspended solids shall be determined and reported in the schedule of extra
strength user surcharges at a cost per pound for each constituent.
   (c)   In connection with the administering of this chapter, reference is
made to Section
927.08 - Control of Industrial Wastewaters of the Sewer Use Ordinance,
specifically those sections pertaining to control manholes, wastewater volume
determination, sampling and monitoring, and analyses.
   (d)   The results of routine sampling and analysis by the owner will be used
to determine the extra strength user surcharges; however, the Board of Trustees
may, at any period or time and of such duration and in such manner as the Board
of Trustees may elect, determine the strength of the discharged wastewater for
purposes of verification. If the owner fails to file the necessary annual
reports, the strength determined by the Public Utilities' analysis will be used
to determine the amount of surcharges. Similarly, the surcharges shall be
applied to the total metered water consumption if the owner fails to file the
required annual reports.
   (e)   If necessary, the Public Utilities shall have the right to enter and
set up, on company property, such devices as are necessary to conduct a gauging
and sampling operation and to begin such operation without advance notice to
the company or owner. While performing the work, the Department's personnel
will observe all safety rules applicable to the premises, established by the
company.
   (f)   Where a company has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry onto company's premises is granted,
such company shall either make necessary arrangements with their security
guards that upon showing proper identification, personnel from the Department
will be permitted to enter, without delays, for the purpose of obtaining
samples (grab or composite) of wastewaters being discharged at the various

owner.
      (3)   The Board of Public Affairs or its authorized representatives is
charged with the enforcement of this section.
      (4)   Any person or entity in violation of any portion of this division
(a) may be charged with a minor misdemeanor for a first offense. Any person or
entity in violation of this division (a) for a second time within one (1) year
may be charged with a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
   (b)   Illegal Discharges to Natural Outlet or Storm Sewer No person shall
discharge or cause to be discharged to any natural outlet or storm sewer any
sanitary or industrial wastewater unless such discharge is under a NPDES Permit
issued by the OEPA.
   (c)   Allowable Discharge of Unpolluted Water. Storm water and all other
unpolluted drainage, such as from air conditioning, swimming pools, etc., shall
be discharged into such sewers as are specifically designed and designated as
storm sewers or a natural outlet approved by the Superintendent. Industrial,
uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted wastewater may be discharged, on
approval of the Superintendent, to a storm sewer, combined sewer, or natural

lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes.
   (g)   Accidental Discharges. Dischargers shall notify the Superintendent
immediately upon the occurrence of a “slugload” or accidental discharge of
substances prohibited by this chapter. The notification shall include location
of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume,
and corrective actions. Any discharger who discharges a slugload of prohibited
materials shall be liable for any expense, loss or damage to the Public Owned
Treatment Works (POTW), in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the
Village on account thereof under State or Federal law.
   (h)   Substances Limited. The following described substances, materials,
waters, or wastes shall be limited in discharge to any public sewer to
concentrations or quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater
treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the
receiving stream, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property,
or constitute a nuisance. The Superintendent may set limitations lower than the
limitations established in the regulations below if in his opinion more severe
limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. Deliberate dilution
with unpolluted water to meet the concentrations established in the regulations
below shall not be acceptable. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability,
the Superintendent will give consideration to such factors as the quantity of
subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity
of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of treatability of the waste in the
wastewater plant, and other pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions
on materials or characteristics of wastes or wastewater discharged to the
sanitary sewer which shall not be violated without approval of the Board of
Trustees are as follows:
      (1)   Wastewater having a temperature higher that 150 degrees F. (65
degrees C.).
      (2)   Wastewater containing more than 100 milligrams per liter of
petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oils, products of mineral oil origin

         B.   These maximum concentrations may be changed as necessary by the
Board of Trustees or State regulatory agencies based on new information
concerning inhibitory substances or to protect treatment plant processes.
Industrial discharges covered by Federal pretreatment requirements shall meet
those limitations specified under the effluent guidelines published under
Section 307 (b) and (c) of the Federal Act or the above concentrations,
whichever is more stringent. Major contributing industries discharging
incompatible pollutants into the public sewers shall be regulated as provided
in division (i) of this Section.
      (6)   No wastewater shall be discharged which exceeds the maximum daily
concentration established for the following compatible pollutants without
permission from the Superintendent and payment of the appropriate surcharge:

concentration as may exceed limits in compliance with applicable State or
Federal regulations.
      (9)   Quantities of flow, concentrations or both which constitute a
“slug” as defined herein.
      (10)   Water or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant effluent
cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
      (11)   Any waters or wastes which by interaction with other waters or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
      (12)   Any waters or wastes that contain more than 10 mg/1 of the
following gases: hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, or nitrous oxide.
      (13)   Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5.
      (14)   Any waters or wastes containing strong acid from pickling wastes,
or concentrated plating solutions whether neutralized or not.

such character and quantity that unusual provisions, attention, or expense is
required to handle such materials at the wastewater treatment plant.
      (16)   Any waters or wastes having excessive discoloration (such as, but
not limited to, dye wastes and spent tanning solutions).
      (17)   Any water or wastes containing unusual BOD5, COD, ammonia, or
chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on
the wastewater treatment plant.
   (i)   Authority for Control of Wastewater Discharges.
      (1)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which contain the substances or posses the
characteristics enumerated in divisions (f) or (h) of this Section, and which
in the judgement of the Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the
wastewater facilities, processes, equipment or receiving waters, including
violation of applicable water quality standards, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent shall:
         A.   Reject the wastes.
         B.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers.
         C.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/
or,
         D.   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes under the extra strength surcharge provisions of the Village's sewer
service rate ordinance.
      (2)   All industrial wastewaters discharged to the public sewers by major
contributing industries shall as a minimum meet the national pretreatment
standards or best practical control technology currently available for
incompatible pollutants as published in Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations,
Part 128, unless the Village is committed, in its NPDES Permit, to remove a
specified percentage of the incompatible pollutant. In those instances the
applicable pretreatment standards may be correspondingly reduced to levels
determined by the Board of Trustees or their authorized representative, or
State regulatory agencies.
      (3)   If the Superintendent requires pretreatment or equalization of
waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Board of Trustees and State
regulatory agencies and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes,
ordinances, and laws. No permit will be granted until such pretreatment
facilities have been placed in operation and have demonstrated their
effectiveness by test.
   The cost of such testing, sampling, and analyzing shall be borne by the
wastewater contributor.
      (4)   The approval of proposed pretreatment facilities by the Board of
Trustees does not guarantee that these facilities or equipment will function in
the manner described by their manufacturer; nor shall it relieve a person, firm
or corporation of the responsibility of enlarging or otherwise modifying such
facilities to accomplish the intended purpose.
   (j)   Grease and Oil Interceptors. For grease, oil, and inorganic material
such as sand, grit, etc., interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion
of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in
division (h) of this Section, or any flammable wastes, sand, and other harmful
ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private
living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the Superintendent, and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these
interceptors the owner shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal
by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain record of the
dates, and means of disposal which are subject to review by the Superintendent.
Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by the owner's
personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.
   (k)   Operation of Pretreatment Facilities. Where pretreatment or flow-
equalizing facilities are provided or required for any waters or wastes, they
shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the
owner at his expense, and shall be subject to periodic inspection by the
Superintendent. The owner shall maintain operation records, and shall submit to
the Superintendent a quarterly summary report of the character of the influent
and effluent to show the performance of the treatment facilities.
   (l)   Analyses. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics
of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this chapter shall be
determined in accordance with the latest edition of “Standard Methods” or “EPA
Methods.” Reference is made to EPA “Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for
Analysis of Pollutants” (40 CFR 136). Sampling methods, location, times,
durations, and frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject
to approval by the Superintendent.
   (m)   Special Conditions. No statement contained in this section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the
Village and any industrial concern whereby an industrial wastewater of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the Village for treatment, subject to
possible payment therefor by the industrial concern for subsequent treatment.
Any industrial concern may appeal any determination made by the Superintendent
in the enforcement of this chapter. Any contract with an industry shall be
governed by all sewer service charges and regulations, as established in the
Village ordinances.

927.08   CONTROL OF INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER.
   (a)   Submission of Basic Data. Within sixty (60) days after passage of this
chapter, each person whose operation entails the discharge of industrial
wastewater to a public sewer shall prepare and file with the Village a written
statement setting forth the nature of the operation contemplated or presently
carried on, the amount and source of water required for use, the proposed point
of discharge of said wastewater into the wastewater collection system of the
Village, the estimated amount to be so discharged and a fair statement setting
forth the expected bacterial, physical, chemical and other known
characteristics of said wastewater. Within a reasonable time of receipt of such
statement, it shall be the duty of the Village to make an order stating such
minimum restrictions as in the judgement of the Board of Trustees may be
necessary to adequately guard against unlawful uses of the Village's wastewater
system. If such a statement has been previously filed with the Village to the
satisfaction of the Board of Trustees the requirements of this Section will be
waived.
   (b)   Extension of Time. When it can be demonstrated that circumstances
exist which would create an unreasonable burden on the person to comply with
the time schedule imposed by division (a) of this section, a request for
extension of time may be presented for consideration of the Board of Trustees.
All requests for extension of time shall be submitted in writing stating the
reasons for such a request. Under no circumstances shall the extension of time
exceed thirty days after approval of the extension by the Board of Trustees.
   (c)   Control Manholes.
      (1)   Each person discharging industrial wastewater into a public sewer
shall construct and maintain one or more control manholes or access points to
facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of his wastewater, including
sanitary wastewater.
      (2)   Control manholes or access facilities shall be located and built in
a manner acceptable to the Superintendent. If measuring devices are to be
permanently installed they shall be of a type acceptable to the Superintendent.
      (3)   Control manholes, access facilities, and related equipment shall be
installed by the person discharging the wastewater at his expense, and shall be
maintained by him so as to be in safe condition, accessible and in proper
operating condition at all times. Plans for the installation of such facilities
shall be approved by the Superintendent prior to the beginning of construction.
      (4)   In the event no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole may be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
   (d)   Wastewater Volume Determination. 
      (1)   The volume of flow used for computing industrial wastewater charges
shall be the metered water consumption of the industrial user as shown in the
records of water meter readings maintained by the Village, except as herein
provided in the following paragraphs.
      (2)   If the person discharging industrial wastewater into the public
sewers procures any part, or all, of this water from sources other than the
Village water system, all or part of which is discharged into the public
sewers, the person shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of a
type approved by the Superintendent for the purpose of determining the volume
of water obtained from those other sources.
      (3)   The person discharging industrial wastewater into the public sewers
may install and maintain at his expense metering devices for determining the
volume of wastewater being discharged to the public sewer, from which the
industrial wastewater charges would be computed. The measuring devices shall be
of a type acceptable to the Superintendent.
      (4)   The Superintendent may require the installation of devices for
measuring the volume of wastewater discharged if these volumes cannot otherwise
be determined from the metered water consumption records.
      (5)   Any metering device for determining the volume of wastewater
discharged to the public sewer shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the
industrial user. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be
removed without the consent of the Superintendent.
   (e)   Sampling and Monitoring.
      (1)   Industrial wastewaters discharged into the public sewers shall be
subject to periodic inspection with a determination of character and
concentration of said wastes. The determination shall be made as often as may
be deemed necessary by the Superintendent. The owner shall be responsible for
the collection and testing o the aforementioned samples.
      (2)   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative
of the composition of the wastewater. One 24-hour composite sample will be
required, as a minimum. The sampling shall be accomplished by the use of
automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting composite samples, or by
other approved means.
      (3)   Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the Superintendent
or his authorized representative at all times. Care shall be exercised in the
collection of samples to insure their preservation in a state comparable to
that at the time the sample was taken.
   (f)   Analyses.
      (1)   Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial
wastewaters shall be those set forth in the latest edition of “Standard
Methods” or “EPA Methods.” However, alternative methods for certain analyses of
industrial wastewaters may be used subject to mutual agreement between the
Superintendent and the industrial user. Reference is made to EPA “Guidelines
Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants” (40 CFR 136) .
      (2)   Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial
wastewaters shall be made by the industrial user responsible for the discharge,
or the industrial user's qualified agent as approved by the Superintendent. The
results of the analyses shall be reported to the Village on forms provided by
the Village. The Village may make its own analyses on the wastewaters and these
determinations, when made shall be binding as a basis for charges, except under
circumstances in the following paragraph.
      (3)   In case the analyses performed by the industry and the Village
result in substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the
industry to collect samples at the same time the Village collects its own
samples. The results of the analyses on the samples collected by the Village
and the industry shall be compared using the same testing procedures as
outlines in the latest edition of “Standard Methods” and the differences
negotiated.

1109.01   LOTS; SIDEWALKS; SETBACKS.
   (a)   Lots. The lot arrangement shall be such that all lots will provide
satisfactory and desirable building sites. The lot size, width, depth, shape,
orientation and the minimum setback lines shall be appropriate to the location
as to sanitation, drainage and topography. The arrangement shall be appropriate
for the type of development and the use contemplated in order to secure and
properly provide for streets, utilities and facilities, in relation to existing
or planned arrangements and to the Comprehensive Regional Plan. It should
provide for adequate and convenient open space for traffic, utilities,
aesthetics, access of fire-fighting and ambulance apparatus, recreation, light,
air, and for the avoidance of congestion of population.
      (1)   Lots in a zoned area. No lot shall have less area or width than is
required by any zoning regulations applying to the area in which it is located
and shall conform to the zoning regulations where the standards are higher than
required by these Subdivision Regulations.
      (2)   Lots not in a zoned area. The following standards shall prevail:
         A.   Lots in a subdivision that are served by sanitary sewers and a
public water supply system shall have a width at the building line of not less
than seventy feet, and shall contain a minimum of 10,000 square feet of area.
         B.   Irregular-shaped lots may be reduced to a lesser frontage,
provided however, that the required square footage is maintained and the width
at the building set-back line equals the required width of the area.
         C.   In case of unusual conditions, accessibility or other physical
factors which may impair or impede public health and/or safety and desirability
or the general neighborhood in which a subdivision is located, larger lot
widths and areas shall be required as may be deemed necessary. It is desired to
have width-to-depth ratio of at least one and one-half but shall not exceed 1
to 5.
         D.   Corner Lots. The width of a lot at the building line shall be at
least twenty percent (20%) wider and contain twenty percent (20%) more area
than the minimum requirements. Either of the two sides of a corner lot,
fronting on a street may be designated as the front of a lot, provided the rear
yard shall always be opposite the frontage as designated.
   (b)   Sidewalks.
      (1)   Requirements. Sidewalks shall be provided for all lots.
      (2)   Location. Sidewalks shall be located parallel to, and one foot

rear property line at any point, shall be required, except family garage or
carport may be a minimum of five feet from the rear property line.
   (d)   Neighborhood Development. Where large subdivisions designed as
neighborhood units are being reviewed, consideration shall be given to the
placement of commercial and public areas, in relation to the neighborhood unit
being planned or developed and to other units that might be developed. Where
small subdivisions are being reviewed, the County Planning Commission shall
coordinate such programs, to practical extent, into units so that the same
environment with respect to commercial and public areas, may be obtained.
(Ord. 1164. Passed 8-16-82.)

railroad right-of-way, or limited access highway right-of-way, the Planning
Commission may require a street approximately parallel to, and on each side of
such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for necessary traffic circulation.
   (d)   Arrangement.
      (1)   Traffic. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by
through traffic will be discouraged.
      (2)   Access to adjacent property. The street layout shall make
provisions for the proper projection and continuance of street into adjacent
unsubdivided acreage where it is deemed appropriate and desirable by the
Commission.
      (3)   Master Plan. Where the plat is to be submitted includes only a part
of the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission shall require a sketch of
a tentative future street system for the unsubdivided portion.
   (e)   Alignment.
      (1)   Horizontal.
         A.   Jogs. Street jogs shall be discouraged, where such jogs are
unavoidable, in no case shall the centerline offsets be less than 125 feet.
         B.   Angle of Intersections. Streets shall intersect at right angles
when possible; in no case shall such intersections intersect at an angle less
than seventy degrees.
         C.   Intersection Approaches. Street intersections shall be straight
for a distance of at least 100 feet from the centerline of the street
intersection.
         D.   Reverse Curve. A tangent of at least 100 feet long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on all but minor streets.
      (2)   Vertical grade at intersections. Approaches to intersections shall
be reduced to a gradient not exceeding five percent (5%) for a distance to meet
requirements of the sight table contained in the Current Manual of Procedure
and Minimum Standards Secondary Road Plan published by the Ohio Department of
Highways.
   (f)   Classification. Each street in the subdivision shall be classified
according to the definitions found in Chapter
1101.
 
Classification                  Minimum   Maximum (º)  Gradient  Gradient

Residential or Collector Street 60        13            8         0.75
 
   When a maximum grade of eight percent (8%) cannot be met, the County
Engineer and the County Planning Director shall jointly determine the maximum
grade to be used, with final approval of the County Planning Commission. The
Planning Commission may make variances to these requirements where it is
determined that unusual topographical and/or other exceptional conditions
require such modifications in streets and highway standards.
(Ord. 1164. Passed 8-16-82.)

(Ord. 1164. Passed 8-16-82.)
1109.09   OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING.
   (a)   Parking Spaces. In computing the number of parking spaces required by
these Subdivision Regulations, a "parking space" means an enclosed or
unenclosed area of not less than 200 square feet, permanently reserved for off-
street parking and connected with a street or alley by a driveway which affords
satisfactory ingress or egress. The following general requirements shall
govern:

1109.10   DRAINAGE.
   (a)   Definitions. Certain terms as used herein are defined as follows:
      (1)   "Flood hazards" means overflow water having sufficient velocity to
transport debris to scour the surface soil, or to dislodge or damage buildings.
It also means erosion of the backwater courses.
      (2)   "Inundations" means standing water or water in motion, of
sufficient depth to damage property due to mere presence of water or of the
deposition of silt.
      (3)   "Average recurrence intervals” means the average intervals in years
between storm water flow of a given magnitude, or greater, over a long period
of time, such as 50 or 100 years.
      (4)   "Waterways".
         A.   "Major" means those with tributary area in excess of four square
miles.
         B.   "Minor" means those with a tributary area of one or less square
miles.
         C.   "Secondary" means those with a tributary area of between one and
four square miles.
   (b)   General Requirements. Subdivisions shall be protected from flood
hazards and inundation by storm water, springs and other surface waters. The
design and construction of the drainage facilities shall be such that water
courses traversing the subdivision and water emanating from within the
subdivision shall be carried through and off the subdivision without any injury
to improvements, residential sites or residences to be installed within the
tract. Drainage water entering the subdivision shall be received and discharged
from the subdivision at the location, and as nearly as possible in the same
manner, as existed prior to the construction of the drainage facilities. Design
of these facilities shall be such that they shall conform to the ultimate
drainage plan for the watershed area in which the subdivision is located.
   (c)   Design of Drainage Facilities.
      (1)   Basic information and data shall include:
         A.   A contour map of the site and adjacent areas including all
natural topographical features, possible outfalls and ditches and any adjoining
terrain sloping toward the site. The contour interval shall not be more than
two feet.
         B.   A drainage working drawing, as an additional map, shall be
submitted. This drainage shall show the layout of the paved areas and building
areas, as well as all future master plan developments. It shall show tentative
finished grade contours, all existing and proposed pipelines, manholes, inlets,
outfalls, individual drainage areas in the subdivision, slopes and like
streams.
         C.   Boring plans and soil profiles prepared on the basis of soil
tests, indicating data on ground water elevation. This data shall include
infiltration properties of the soil.
      (2)   Hydrologic design. Those waterways set forth in an adapted plan for
Columbiana County in sections related to drainage shall be designed and
constructed for the quantities of water indicated in accordance with the
following frequencies:
         A.   Major waterways; an average recurrence interval of 100 years.
         B.   Secondary waterways; an average recurrence interval of 50 years.
         C.   Minor waterways; an average recurrence interval of 10 years.
Design quantities of flow for major waterways shall be provided. Design flow
for secondary and minor drainage facilities shall be computed by the
subdivision's engineer by use of the rational formula: Q = C i A.
               Where   Q =   Cubic feet per second
                     C =   Runoff coefficient
                      i =   Intensity of rainfall in inches per hour
                     A =   Tributary area in acres
      (3)   Hydraulic design. The hydraulic design of the area shall be such
that, after accumulating all energy losses through the various drainage
transmission systems within the subdivision depths of flow shall not exceed
curb height for a ten year average recurrence interval. For more remote events
depth of flow or ponding shall not exceed a level of which would cause
inundations of foundations or basements in residential structures within the
subdivision. Further, unless approved by the Director, no design energy grade
line of any closed or open waterways, or any bridges, culverts or other
appurtenances thereto, excepting curb gutter or road side ditches sections,
shall at any point be less than three feet below ground level. Within the
subdivision, catch basins shall be so placed along the streets that the width
of the flow in the gutter shall not exceed two feet for a one year average
recurrence interval and will not exceed the top of the curb for a ten year
average recurrence interval. Site grading within the subdivision shall be such
that all lots and service areas will drain readily. Bridges and box culverts
spanning open waterways shall have a minimum freeboard above water surface of
one and one-half feet. French drains may be used as a temporary flow
correction, but only after approval by the Director.
      (4)   Structural design. Catch basins, manholes, inlet structures,
temporary drains and sumps placed within the subdivision shall conform to
standard drawings as adopted by the latest Ohio Department of Transportation
Construction Design Manual.
         A.   Channels. Centerline radius, minimum top and bottom widths, side
slope ratios, factor of roughness and other channel flow data shall conform to
the County Engineer's requirements. Earth channels constructed within the
subdivision shall have side slopes of one foot vertical to two feet horizontal
or flatter. Revetment, bank stabilization and stream bed stabilization along
constructed or natural channels, shall be required if the channel velocities
are sufficient to cause bank or invert erosion. The top of the bank shall be so
graded that side drainage shall enter channels only at points where structural
inlets are provided to prevent bank erosion. Side drainage tributaries shall
enter the main channels as nearly parallel with stream flow as possible. Earth
channels constructed in those areas not reveted, shall be secured from erosion,
siltation and increased flow concentration by planting of vegetation and by
mulching as specified by the Planning Commission.
         B.   Closed Conduits. Except for adequate natural waterways and
allowable gutter flows, all storm drainage within the subdivision which is
capable of being transmitted in a reinforced concrete pipe forty-two inches or
less in diameter or equivalent material with the same flow capacities shall be
carried R.C. P. or equivalent, and the minimum clearance between top of pipe
and ground shall be two feet. The alignment of closed conduit shall be as
nearly straight as practicable without undue bends and angle points; manholes
shall be provided at all angle points and at intervals not to exceed 400 feet
along the conduit. Inverted siphons shall not be permitted except for temporary
structures. Nonreinforced concrete pipe, or the equivalent, may be used outside
of road right-of-way provided the strength of such pipe is sufficient to
withstand loads imposed upon them. In the event of possible erosion conditions
in closed conduits, additional paving shall be provided as necessary to assure
a project life of fifty years.
   (d)   Headwalls.
      (1)   Headwalls (cut-off) shall be required on all surface drainage
pipes. Where we have cross pipes, at least the main streets shall have
headwalls.
      (2)   Headwalls or rip rap or both shall be required on all pipe
structures. These are pipe structures that are large enough to take the place
of a bridge. All headwall structures shall be designed to State Highway
Standards.
   (e)   Right of Way for Drainage Purposes.
      (1)   Right of way for closed conduits and appurtenances. An easement not
less than eight feet in width and sufficient to contain the closed conduit and
appurtenances plus two feet on either side thereof shall be dedicated on the
final map of the subdivision as follows: "Drainage Easement to Township".
Drainage easements for closed conduit shall not traverse a building site and
shall, insofar as possible, be placed along or adjacent to lot boundary lines
in a straight alignment without angle points.
      (2)   Right-of-way for natural waterways. Where natural waterways
traverse the subdivision requiring sufficient waterway area to contain design
discharge within design limits as hereinafter stated, and where such natural
waterways are endowed with sufficient natural beauty and have proved themselves
reasonably stable, the subdivider may leave such channels in their natural
state. Such scenic waterways as dedicated under this section need not be
fenced, but shall have permanent marker posts extending three feet above ground
set at all intersecting property lines along the right-of-way line and at angle
points. When natural waterways contain sufficient waterway area or where such
waterways have proved themselves unstable only at frequent locations, and where
minor construction could provide an adequate channel and still preserve, in the
main, the natural channel beauty, the subdivider may make such minor
improvements as is required to provide a channel which would otherwise meet the
conditions of this section.
      (3)   Right of way for constructed channels and appurtenances. Earth
channels constructed within the subdivision shall have sufficient right-of-way
dedicated to contain the top width of the channel plus an eight foot horizontal
continuous maintenance way on one side, and two feet horizontal on the other
side for channels less than fifty feet in top width. A ten foot horizontal
maintenance way shall be provided on both sides of channels having a top width
greater than fifty feet.
         A.   Right-of-way concrete lined channels shall extend to edge of
concrete only, with ten feet access provided at intervals of not less than 1000
feet. Such access shall extend to channel invert by means of access ramps
having a maximum slope not to exceed fifteen percent (15%).
         B.   All constructed channels shall have either a five foot high chain
link fence or a four foot chain link fence with a two-strand barb wire placed
along the right-of-way line. Chain link drive gates shall be provided at road
intersections and all other points of access.
         C.   The right-of-way width for earth channels shall be increased over
that given above as necessary to provide an eight foot access around any
structure of bridge and in the event that the right-of-way does not intersect a
road, ten feet access shall be provided for a road.
         D.   Right-of-way for constructed channels shall be dedicated as a
separate parcel, or parcels, on the final subdivision map and designated as
follows: "Right-of-way to                                    "
   (f)   Tentative Drainage Plans. The Planning Commission may require where it
deems necessary that a tentative subdivision map with sufficient data for the
Commission's staff to check the feasibility of the drainage system as proposed
by the subdivider. The following data shall be provided:
      (1)   Hydrologic calculations (at all critical points within the
subdivision)
         A.   Tributary drainage area delineated on the map
         B.   Times of concentration
         C.   Intensity of rainfall
         D.   Runoff coefficient
         E.   Design flow.
      (2)   Hydraulic calculations.
         A.   The plan and profiles of all drainage ways shall be provided,
imposed upon which shall be the design energy and hydraulic grade lines.
         B.   Sizes and types of drainage improvements, including special
structure, typical sections, right-of-way width and fencing.
         C.   Supporting calculations for upstream and downstream channel
capacities as they affect overflow or backwater within the subdivision. Such
calculations shall substantiate such additional survey information as is
required to determine profile and cross section of the upstream and downstream
channel portion under consideration.
         D.   Sufficient contours and grading details to indicate proposed
street grades and elevations and site grades and elevations throughout the
subdivision.
   (g)   Construction Plans. The final construction plans for drainage within
the subdivision shall conform to the provision of these Subdivision Regulations
and to any special conditions as required by the Planning Commission in
approving the tentative map. Such construction plans for drainage shall be
approved by the staff of the Commission prior to construction of any drainage
facilities within the subdivision.
(Ord. 1164. Passed 8-16-82.)
1109.11   OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of providing for open space subdivision tracts is
to offer recreational opportunities close to home, to enhance the appearance of
neighborhoods through preservation of natural green spaces, to counteract the
effects of urban congestion and monotony, and to encourage participation by all
age groups in the use and care of local open space tracts. Such types as local
parks, small recreational areas and other small open spaces in a planned
neighborhood pattern are intended to conserve local spots of natural beauty, to
provide structure to neighborhood design, to add to the sense of spaciousness,
to encourage cooperative relationship between neighbors, to help promote the
public health, safety, morals and welfare of the people residing nearby and to
aid in stabilizing property values.
   (b)   Designation of Local Space Tracts in Residential Subdivisions. No
Preliminary Plat submitted under this option for the proposed development of
land for residential purposes in Columbiana County shall be approved by the
Planning Commission unless such plan provides for local open space tracts of
suitable size, location, shape and topography with convenient pedestrian
access. Such tracts are to be incorporated in the design of the subdivision
through one of the approved methods for applying lot allocations and design
standards as set forth in this section, with such exceptions as are hereinafter
provided and in accordance with and contingent upon the adoption of appropriate
zoning regulations.
      (1)   In the case of apartment developments such appropriate portions of
the land as are proposed as open area on the site plan, exclusive of parking
areas and driveways, shall be so located and planned as to provide, for
apartment residents, local open space amenities of such type as shall serve the
purposes designated in division (a) hereof, with openness comparable in quality
and character to that of nonapartment subdivisions developed under this option.
      (2)   In the case of two or more adjacent subdivisions, developers may
cooperatively allocate open space tracts, the coordinated location and design
of which shall be subject to Planning Commission approval.
   (c)   Minimum and Maximum Sizes. The area set aside for each local open
space tract shall be not less than 20, 000 square feet, with the exception off
such features as special street center islands other than those normally
required as median strips for boulevard-type motorways, and recreational
walkways, including those that have wider rights-of-way than are required in
the Subdivision Regulations for normal street, sidewalks and block
crosswalkways.
      (1)   The maximum area for any separate and distinct local open space
tract or any individually enlarged space which is part of an essentially linear
pattern of local open space, excluding local stream valley parks or green belt
buffers, is five acres.
      (2)   Where practical difficulties or unusual hardships are encountered,
the Director may, upon authorization by the Planning Commission, give written
approval to a lesser minimum area, or a greater maximum area than is required
herein. If the application of the allocation standards contained in division
(h) hereof would result in local open space tracts which are too small to be
satisfactory, the Planning Commission, may waive the requirement of allocation
of local open space tracts as a condition of approval of the Preliminary Plat
of a subdivision. Each Preliminary Plat submitted by a developer shall clearly
show any of the contiguous property holdings of such developer so that the
purpose and intent of this section cannot be circumvented; and it shall be the
obligation. of the Planning Commission to take suitable steps to assure that
the developer is not omitting any of his contiguous holdings from the
Preliminary Plat.
   (d)   Ownership, Improvement and Maintenance Open Spaces; Exception.
      (1)   Local open space tracts, at the option of the developer, may be
retained permanently by him, or be deeded by him to the County or other
appropriate public entity. When such tracts are retained by the developer,
plans for improvement and maintenance of these tracts, excluding structures and
equipment, shall be approved, and suitable deed covenants documented to assure
both continuing use of the tracts for local open space purposes, and, proper
operation and maintenance of the same to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission, and, suitably managed for, and primarily maintained for, the use of
nearby residents.
      (2)   Acceptance of a local open space tract, when conveyed by a
developer, shall be endorsed upon the deed. Recorded with the deed shall be the
provisions that such land, being properly restricted for use as local open
space only, shall be in perpetuity. After the acceptance of the title to such
local open space tracts, and if so requested by a qualified local improvement
association, the County, or the other appropriate public entity, may arrange
with such association to cooperatively undertake the improvement and/or
maintenance of such tract to the extent of mutual agreement.
      (3)   Where local open space tracts are to be conveyed to a governmental
subdivision in fee, the developer shall convey them at the stage and in the
condition agreed upon in connection with processing and approval of the
subdivision. Title to the land shall be unencumbered. The governmental
subdivision shall take title to such land at a time approved by the Planning
Commission and, in any case, not later than the time at which title to the
streets in the subdivision are accepted by the County. It is the intent of this
legislation that, prior to acceptance by the governmental subdivision, the
developer shall not be compelled to improve the condition of a local open space
tract, the original land features of which within the context of the final and
approved development plan, make it suitable as open space. In the case of
apartment projects all land shall be retained and maintained by the apartment
owner.
   (e)   Standards for Allocation of Open Spaces.
      (1)   Percentage allocation, (Quantitative minimum standards for
allocation of acreage for local open space tracts), shall be determined, except
as hereinafter noted, as a percentage of the total gross residential acreage of
the subdivision. "Gross residential acreage" means the residentially zoned
acreage within the perimeter of the subdivision proposed for residential
development, plus not more than half the width of existing or recorded boundary
streets (maximum sixty-foot right-of-way) to which the subdivision has right of
access, except storm drainage reservation strips to the extent that they exceed
in area fifteen percent (15%) of the subdivision. The required local open space
allocation schedule applicable to residential zones in the Columbiana County
Subdivision Regulations is as follows:
 
Type of Dwelling Unit
One-family zone       5% or 20,000 sq. ft. whichever is greater
Two-family zone       8% or 20,000 sq. ft. whichever is greater
Multiple-family zone  12% or 20,000 sq. ft. whichever is greater
 
      (2)   In a one-family zone the subdivider may elect to set aside open
space tracts in accordance with the cluster method of subdivision as provided
for in division (f) hereof, rather than the method described in this division.
Regardless of method chosen, in the one-family zone not less than five percent
(5%) of the gross residential acreage of the tract or 20, 000 square feet
whichever is greater, must be allocated to local open space, except where the
development results in a density below the normal density specified in this
subsection, in which case the requirements of this subsection shall apply.
 
                      Gross Residential Density *
                      Normal Density **
Type of dwelling unit Maximum permitted density (per acre) Normal density **
                                                           (per acre)
One-family zone       3.2                                  2.75
Two-family zone       5.0                                  4.35
Multiple-family zone  8.0                                  6.50
*   Gross residential acreage divided into number of dwelling units.
**   Preferred - due to Columbiana County characteristics.
 
      (3)   Allocation of storm drainage reservation strips to local open space
use (applies to all subdivisions other than cluster subdivisions referred to in
division (f) hereof). Where a storm drainage reservation strip is deemed
necessary and appropriate for water control and where natural assets of the
land, including its vegetation, is retained, such area may account for fifty
percent (50%) of the total open space requirements. A graphic, or written plan,
and description of the area, showing the land use relationship, shall be
submitted to and be subject to approval of the Planning Commission. In
exceptional cases, governed chiefly by such factors as appropriate size, degree
of park-like characteristics of the drainage reservation strips, and its
location in the subdivision, the Planning Commission may agree to strip(s)
providing more than fifty percent (50%) of the local open space requirements.
   (f)   Cluster Subdivisions. Cluster type subdividing is permissible only
when public water supply and sanitary sewer facilities are utilized. These
subdivisions may provide one or more areas for local open space tracts through
reduction of permitted minimum lot areas and lot width provided that, land
areas at least equal to the aggregate amount the lots are reduced is designated
as local open space in the subdivision plans. These alternate provisions may
supersede requirements specified in Section
1109.01(c).
   (g)   Cluster Subdivision Schedule.
 
Lot size average Lot size minimum Maximum % of lots below Minimum frontage of
(sq. ft.)        (sq. ft.)        average                 lots at setback line
                                                          (feet)
9,000            8,000            50                      60
 
   In cluster subdivisions, covenants subject to approval of the Planning
Commission to insure permanence and proper use of the open space tracts, must
be recorded.
   (h)   Design and Procedures Manual for Developers. Council may provide and
from time to time revise, a manual of design and administration of this
section, such manual to serve as a guide for developers and as an aid in the
administration of the provisions of these Subdivision Regulations.

Code, may be taken by any person aggrieved, including a tenant, or by a
governmental officer, department, board or bureau. Such application shall be
filed with the Zoning Inspector, who shall transmit the same to the Board. A
fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be made with the Zoning Inspector or

an officer of the Municipality affected by any decision of the Zoning
Inspector. Such appeal shall be taken within twenty days after the decision by
filing with the Zoning Inspector and with the Board of Zoning Appeals a notice
of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Inspector shall forthwith
transmit to the Board of Zoning Appeals all the papers constituting the record
upon which the action appealed was taken.
      (2)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the Zoning Inspector shall certify to the Board of Zoning
Appeals after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with it, that by
reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his/her opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not
be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals or by a court of equity after notice to the officer
from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
   (c)   Hearings.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of an appeal, give at least ten days public notice thereof in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality and at least ten days

However, the Board of Zoning Appeals may go into executive session for
discussion but not vote on any case before it.
      (3)   Upon the day for hearing any application or appeal, the Board of
Zoning Appeals may adjourn the hearing in order to permit the obtaining of
additional information or to cause such further notice as it deems proper to be
served upon such other property owners as it decides may be substantially
interested in such application or appeal. In the case of an adjourned hearing,
persons previously notified and persons already heard need not be notified of
the time of resumption of such hearing unless the Board so decides.

and conditions of the same in the permit to the applicant or appellant,
whenever a permit is authorized by the Board.
      (3)   A decision of the Board shall not become final until the expiration
of five days from the date such decision is made, unless the Board shall find
the immediate taking effect of such decision is necessary for the preservation
of property or personal rights and shall so certify on the record.
      (4)   The Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify,
the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from and shall make
such order, requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to
be made in the premises, and to that end shall have all powers of the Zoning
Inspector from whom the appeal is taken.
      (5)   Any aggrieved party may appeal a decision made by the Zoning Board
to Village Council by filing a written notice of appeal to Council within seven
days of the date of the Zoning Board’s final written decision. Council shall

(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1164.07   POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the following powers and duties:
   (a)   It shall be the Board’s duty to hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged that there is error of law in any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by the Zoning Inspector in the enforcement of this Zoning
Code, or any amendments thereto.
   (b)   In hearing and deciding appeals, the Board shall have the power to:
      (1)   Permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a
district divides a lot or tract held in a single ownership at the time of the
passage of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   Interpret provisions of this Zoning Code in such a way as to carry
out the intent and purpose of the plan, as shown upon the Zoning District Map
fixing the several districts, accompanying and made a part of this Zoning Code
by reference, where the street layout actually on the ground varies from the
street layout as shown on the Map aforesaid.
      (3)   Permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has
been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God or the public enemy to the extent
of more than sixty percent of its fair market value when the Board finds some
compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use, and the
primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to continue a
monopoly.
      (4)   Permit the modification of automobile parking space or loading
space requirements when, in the particular instance, such modification will not
be inconsistent with the purpose and intent of such requirements, or permit the
waiver of the requirement that automobile parking space shall be provided on
the same lot with a dwelling, if other suitable and convenient parking space is
available within or without a building, or permit the dual use of parking
facilities (i.e. businesses and other permitted activities), provided that
there is no overlapping of use and provided that the parking space requirements
for each building or use are complied with during each period.
      (5)   Permit in “R” Districts public parking areas or storage garages
adjacent to any existing or proposed use in districts permitting multiple
dwellings and in Business and Industrial Districts.
      (6)   Determine whether an industry should be permitted within the M-1 or
M-2 Industrial District because of the methods by which it would be operated
and because of its effect upon uses within surrounding zoning districts.
      (7)   Permit the substitution of a nonconforming use existing at the time
of enactment of this Zoning Code with another nonconforming use if no
structural alterations, except those required by law or ordinance, are made,
provided, however, that in an “R” District, no change shall be authorized by
the Board to any use which is not a permitted or conditional use in any “R”
District, and in a “B” District, no change shall be authorized to any use which
is not a permitted or conditional use in any “B” District.
      (8)   Permit the temporary use of a structure or premises in any district
for a purpose or use that does not conform to the regulations prescribed
elsewhere in this Zoning Code for the district in which it is located provided
that such use is of a temporary nature and does not involve the erection of a
substantial structure. A zoning certificate for such use shall be granted in
the form of a temporary and revocable permit for not more than a twelve-month
period, subject to such conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety,
convenience and general welfare.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1164.08   VARIANCES; NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals and Village Council shall have the power
to hear and decide appeals and authorize such variances from the provisions or
requirements of this Zoning Code as will not be contrary to the public
interest. In authorizing a variance, the Board may attach conditions and
require guarantee or bond as it may deem necessary to ensure compliance with
the objectives of this Zoning Code. On appeal where there is unnecessary
hardship, the Board may grant a variance in the application of the provisions
of this Zoning Code only if all of the following findings are made:
      (1)   That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions generally created by the
provisions of this Zoning Code in the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located.
      (2)   That because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Code and that the authorization of a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      (3)   That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
      (4)   That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located,
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property or be detrimental to the public welfare.
      (5)   That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
   (b)   The Board of Zoning Appeals or Village Council or the governing
appellate review board/body determines that granting a variance would serve the
best interest of the Village.
   (c)   The Board of Zoning Appeals and Village Council shall have the
authority to grant an extension or permit completion of a building devoted to a
nonconforming use upon a lot occupied by such building, or on a lot adjoining,
provided that such lot was under the same ownership as the lot in question on
the date such building became nonconforming and provided that such extension is
necessary and incidental to the existing use of such building, provided,
however, that the floor areas of such extension shall not exceed, in all, 100
percent of the floor area of the existing building or buildings devoted to a
nonconforming use, and provided, further, that such extension or extensions
shall be undertaken within five years of the date when the use of such building
became nonconforming.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1164.09   CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   Under the authorization granted in Ohio R.C. Chapter 713 to hear and
decide special exceptions to the terms of this Zoning Code, the Board shall
have the power to decide applications for conditional uses in those cases
specified in
Chapter 1170. In considering such application, the Board shall give due regard
to the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures and may impose
such requirements and conditions as the Board may deem necessary for the
protection of adjacent properties and the public interest, including specific
limitations as to future expansion.
   (b)   The following basic standards shall apply to conditional uses in any
“S” or “R” District:
      (1)   The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations involved in or conducted in connection with it, its site layout, and
its relation to streets giving access to it, shall be such that both pedestrian
and vehicular traffic to and from the use and the assembly of persons in
connection with it will not be hazardous, inconvenient or conflict with the
normal traffic on residential streets, both at the time and as the same may be
expected to increase with any prospective increase in the population of the
area, taking into account convenient routes of pedestrian traffic, particularly
of children, the relation of the use to main traffic thoroughfares and to
street intersections and the general character and intensity of development of
the area.
      (2)   The location and height of buildings, the location, nature and
height of walls and fences and the nature and extent of landscaping on the site
shall be such that the use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate
development and use of adjacent land and buildings.
   (c)   The following basic standards shall apply to conditional uses in any
“B” or “M” District:
      (1)   The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations involved in or conducted in connection with it, its site layout, and
its relation to streets giving access to it, shall be such that vehicular
traffic to and from the use will not be more hazardous than the normal traffic
of the district, both at the time and as the same may be expected to increase
with increasing development of the Municipality, taking into account vehicular
turning movements in relation to routes of traffic flow, street intersections,
sight distances and pedestrian traffic.
      (2)   The nature, location, size and site layout of the use shall be such
that it will be a harmonious part of the “B” or “M” District in which it is
situated, taking into account prevailing shopping habits, convenience of access
by prospective patrons, the physical and economic relationships of one type of
use to another and characteristic groupings of uses in a “B” or “M” District.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1164.10   ISSUANCE OF ZONING CERTIFICATES FOR USES SUBJECT TO PERFORMANCE
REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to authorize the
issuance of a zoning certificate for a use that is subject to performance
requirements as set forth in this Zoning Code.
   (b)   The application for a zoning certificate for a use subject to
performance requirements shall be accompanied by a plan of the proposed
construction or development, a description of the proposed machinery, processes
and products, and specifications for the mechanisms and techniques to be used
in meeting the performance requirements.
   (c)   The Board may refer the application to one or more expert consultants
qualified to advise as to whether a proposed use will conform to the
performance requirements. The costs of such services shall be borne by the
applicant, and a copy of any reports shall be furnished to the applicant.
(Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1164.11   INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT MAP.
   Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as recorded,
differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the Zoning District Map, the
Board of Zoning Appeals, after notice to the owners of the property and after
public hearing, shall interpret the Map in such a way as to carry out the
intent and purpose of this Zoning Code. In case of any questions as to the
location of any boundary line between zoning districts, a request for
interpretation of the Zoning District Map may be made to the Board, and a
determination shall be made by such Board.

enterprise may be equivalent to one and one-half square feet of sign area for
each linear foot of width of a building, or part of a building, occupied by
such enterprise, but shall not exceed a maximum area of 100 square feet. In
computing the area of free-standing or protruding signs, all faces on which
advertising is displayed are considered sign area.
      (6)   In any Business or Industrial District located adjacent to the

advertising structures, where permitted, shall be set back from the established
right-of-way line of any street or highway at least as far as the required
front yard depth for a principal use in the district where such sign or outdoor
advertising structure is permitted, except for the following modifications:
      (1)   For every square foot by which such sign or outdoor advertising
structure exceeds eighty square feet, such setback shall be increased by one-
half but need not exceed 100 feet.
      (2)   At an intersection of any State or Federal highway with a major or
secondary street, the setback of any sign or outdoor advertising structure
shall not be less than 100 feet from the established right-of-way of each
highway or street.

erection of a single-family dwelling even though its area and width are less
than the minimum requirements set forth in this Zoning Code. Each side yard
shall be a minimum of five feet. Where two adjacent lots of record with less
than the required area and width are held by one owner, the Board may require
that the lot be combined and used for one main building. In either case, the
prevailing setback shall be met. Where three or more contiguous unimproved lots
of record with less than the required area and width are held by one owner, the
Board may require replatting to fewer lots to permit compliance with minimum
yard requirements.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)

the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code or where enforcement shall result in
extreme hardship. Either exception shall require approval of the Board of
Zoning Appeals. Accessory buildings, such as garages, may be located in the
rear yard, provided that such buildings are set back at least four feet from
the side lot lines and four feet from the rear lot lines.

1180.01   PURPOSES.
   The Municipal officials concerned with property development shall take into
account that it is increasingly difficult to forecast the various conditions
and factors that may be encountered in sizable developments, and that certain
latitude, flexibility and freedom in the execution of the design and layout of
a project should be suggested or otherwise permitted by the Municipality so as
to encourage the developer to adjust streets to irregular topography; to take
advantage of topography in order to utilize the natural surface drainage; to
economize in the construction of sewers and storm drainage facilities; to
reduce the amount of grading and thus minimize destruction of trees and
topsoil; to adjust the layout to geographical and cultural limitations, such as
property ownership lines; and, among other things, to create architectural
variation in the development as well as attractive and usable buildings and
building sites. Further, such developments shall be designed so as to enhance
the community in general by providing amenities which are unique to the
community.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1180.02   PERMITTED USES; MINIMUM SITE AREA.
   Planned unit developments may be residential, commercial or industrial
developments, or they may be combinations of uses, such as residential and
commercial, or commercial and industrial. The minimum site area for a
residential development shall be twenty acres; for a commercial development,
five acres; and for an industrial development, thirty acres. If a combination
of uses is proposed, a residential-commercial development shall have a minimum
of thirty acres, and a commercial-industrial development shall have a minimum
of forty acres. In combination developments, the amount of land devoted to
commercial usage shall not exceed twelve and one-half percent of the total land
area of the development.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1180.03   SUBMISSION OF PLANS; PUBLIC HEARINGS; NOTICE.
   A development plan shall be submitted to Council and shall be referred to
the Planning Commission for study and report and for public hearings. Notice
and publication of such public hearings shall conform to the procedures
prescribed in
Chapter 1166 for hearings on changes and amendments to this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1180.04   REQUIRED PLANS; ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)   In order for the Planning Commission to better determine that a
planned unit development meets all requirements, the developer shall furnish a
preliminary plan for the entire tract showing topography, roads, lot lines, lot
areas, easements, encumbrances and other relevant data. The plan shall include
the location of existing structures, areas of shrubs and/or trees of ten-inch
diameter or more, existing contours and the proposed grading plan.
   (b)   Upon determination by the Commission that the proposed planned unit
development project as shown by the preliminary plan conforms to the
requirements of all applicable provisions of this Zoning Code, the proponent
shall prepare and submit a final development plan, and such plan shall
incorporate any changes or modifications required by the Commission.
   (c)   Upon approval by the Commission, the plans shall be submitted to
Council for consideration and action. The approval and recommendations of the
Commission shall be based on the following general conditions:
      (1)   The plan is consistent with the intent and purpose of this Zoning
Code to promote public health, safety, morals and general welfare.
      (2)   The use of the land shall be similar to the uses permitted in the
district to which such plan pertains.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1180.05   ACTION BY COUNCIL.
   Following a public hearing, Council may modify the plan, consistent with the
intent and meaning of this Zoning Code, and may rezone the property to the
classification permitting the proposal, for development in substantial
conformity with the final plan as approved by Council.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1180.06   ADJUSTMENTS TO PLANS; APPROVAL BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   After the final development plan has been approved by Council, and in
carrying out this plan, adjustment or rearrangements of buildings, parking
areas, entrances, heights or yards may be requested by the proponents, and
provided that such requests conform to the standards established by the final
development plan and this Zoning Code, such adjustments or rearrangements may
be authorized by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1180.07   ENCOURAGEMENT OF DEVELOPMENTS; CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   Planned unit developments shall be encouraged, but they shall conform to the
regulations of this Zoning Code. In the event of a conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter and any other provision of this Zoning Code, the
provision of this chapter shall control.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1180.08   DEVELOPMENTS IN "R" DISTRICTS.
   In “R” Districts, a planned unit development may be permitted as follows:
   (a)   The lot area per family may be reduced, but such reduction shall not
exceed twenty percent of the area required in Section
1118.01.
   (b)   Sixty percent of the lot area reduction, or not less than ten percent
of the total project area, shall be devoted to open space and recreational
facilities for the residents of the area being developed. Such open space land
or recreational facilities shall be held in corporate ownership by the owners
of the project area building sites, and the developer shall incorporate into
the protective covenants and/or deed restrictions a clause giving an interest
in such land to each owner who buys property within the development. As an
alternative to a property owners’ association, the developer may deed the land
to a public agency, which shall maintain the open space in lieu of a property
owners’ association.
   (c)   In no case shall the density of families per net residential acre be
greater than twelve percent more than that which would be permitted in “A” or
“R” Districts under the requirements of Section
1178.01.
   (d)   The lot width and required yards may be reduced by not more than a ten
percent reduction of the requirements of Section
1178.01.
   (e)   The design of single and two-family residential structures to be
erected in a planned unit development shall be so varied in placement of
windows, entranceways, roof design, coloring and height that no structure shall
be closer than five lots to another structure substantially similar in design.
The lot width may be varied due to the variety of structural designs, and it is
recommended that setbacks be varied, but in no case shall a structure be closer
to the street than is permitted by the front yard requirements as modified in
this section. If lot widths for single or two-family residential lots are
varied by the developer, he or she shall enter into an agreement with the
County that the property owners within a planned unit development of this
nature shall be assessed equally for any improvements which may be by
assessment, rather than by a front-footage basis.
   (f)   Every property shall be designed to abut upon the open space or
recreation facilities required by division (b) hereof.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1180.09   DEVELOPMENTS IN "B" DISTRICTS.
   (a)   In "B" Districts, a planned unit development may be permitted in
accordance with the provisions of this section if the Planning Commission is
satisfied that:
      (1)   The proponents of the development are financially able to carry out
the proposed project;
      (2)   They intend to start construction within one year of the approval
of the project and necessary change in zoning;
      (3)   They intend to complete it within a reasonable time as determined
by the Commission; and
      (4)   The need for the proposed development has been demonstrated by
means of market studies and such other evidence as the Commission may require.
   (b)   Commercial buildings and establishments shall be planned as groups
having common parking areas and common ingress and egress points in order to
reduce the number of potential accident locations at intersections with
thoroughfares. In planning these groups of buildings or establishments, no yard
space will be required between uses within the groups. However, the yard
requirements must be observed at the edge of the complete development. Planting
screens or fences as provided elsewhere in this Zoning Code shall be required.
   (c)   Off-street parking and loading requirements shall be observed as
required. Group parking facilities shall provide spaces equal to the number of
spaces required for each use to be developed.
   (d)   The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and
harmonious design of buildings, and for adequate and properly arranged
facilities for internal traffic circulation, landscaping and such other
features and facilities as may be necessary to make the project attractive and
efficient from the standpoint of the developer as well as from the standpoint
of the adjoining and surrounding, existing or potential, developments.
   (e)   The ground area occupied by all the buildings shall not exceed in the
aggregate twenty-four percent of the total area of the lot or tract.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1180.10   DEVELOPMENTS IN "M" DISTRICTS.
   In “M” Districts, a planned unit development may be permitted as follows:
   (a)   Industrial uses and parcels shall be developed in park-like
surroundings utilizing landscaping and existing woodlands as buffers to screen
lighting, parking areas, loading areas or docks and/or outdoor storage of raw
materials or products. A planned industrial area shall provide for the harmony
of buildings and a compact grouping or groupings in order to economize in the
provision of such utility services as are required. Thoroughfares shall be kept
to a minimum throughout a planned industrial area so that the thoroughfares
which are constructed may be built to the highest possible standards.
   (b)   Certain types of commercial uses, such as a restaurant, central
secretarial or stenographic pool, or other business service type uses, repair
services, or clinics, may form a small commercial center in a planned
industrial area to serve the needs of the industries or their personnel.
   (c)   Off-street parking and loading areas shall conform to the provisions
of this Zoning Code and all screening requirements shall be observed.
   (d)   No building shall be less than seventy-five feet from any boundary of
the tract on which the office, research or industrial development is located.
All intervening spaces between the street pavement and the right-of-way line
and intervening spaces between buildings, drives, parking areas and improved
areas shall be landscaped with trees and plantings and properly maintained at
all times.

or change. Whenever a building or use existing prior to the effective date of
this Zoning Code is enlarged to the extent of fifty percent or more in floor
area or in the area used, such building or use shall then and thereafter comply
with the parking requirements set forth in this section.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1182.02   SPECIAL PARKING PROVISIONS.
   Every parcel of land hereafter used as a public, commercial or private
parking lot shall be developed and maintained in accordance with the following
requirements:
   (a)   Screening and Landscaping. Off-street parking areas for more than ten
vehicles shall be effectively screened on each side which adjoins or faces
premises situated in any “R” District, or institutional premises, by a fence of
acceptable design. Such fence shall be not less than four feet nor more than
six feet in height and shall be maintained in good condition without any
advertising thereon. The space between such wall or fence and the lot line of
the adjoining premises in any “R” District shall be landscaped with grass,
hardy shrubs or evergreen ground cover and maintained in good condition. In
lieu of such wall or fence, a strip of land riot less than ten feet in width
and planted and maintained with an evergreen hedge or dense planting of
evergreen shrubs not less than four, feet in height may be substituted.
   (b)   Minimum Distance and Setbacks. No part of any parking area for more
than ten vehicles shall be closer than twenty feet to any dwelling, school,
hospital or other institution for human care located on an adjoining lot,
unless separated by an acceptably designed screen. If on the same lot with a
main building, the parking area shall not be located within the front yard
required for such building. In no case shall any part of a parking area be
closer than five feet to any established street or alley right of way. The wall
or hedge required in division (a) hereof shall be set back from each street,
the same as if it were a building wall, so as to observe the front yard
requirements of this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Joint Uses. Two or more nonresidential uses may jointly provide and
use parking spaces when their hours of operation do not normally overlap,
provided that a written agreement, approved by the Solicitor and accepted by
the Board of Zoning Appeals, shall be filed with the application for a zoning
certificate.
   (d)   Other Locations. Parking spaces may be located on a lot within 300
feet from the one containing the principal building with the approval of the
Board, provided that a written agreement, approved by the Solicitor and
accepted by the Board, shall be filed with the application for a zoning
certificate.
   (e)   Surfacing. Any off-street parking area for more than ten vehicles
shall be graded for proper drainage and surfaced so as to provide a durable and
dustless surface.
   (f)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking area
shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining premises in
any “R” District.
(Ord. 1466. Passed 4-11-94; Am. Ord. 1905. Passed 12-13-11.)
1182.03   OFF-STREET LOADING.
   (a)   In any district, in connection with every building or part thereof
hereafter erected and having a gross floor area of 10,000 square feet or less,
which is to be occupied by manufacturing, storage, warehouse, retail store,
wholesale store, market, hotel, hospital, mortuary, dry cleaning or other uses
similarly requiring the receipt or distribution, by vehicle, of material or
merchandise, there shall be provided and maintained on the same lot with such
building at least one off-street loading space, plus one additional loading
space for each additional 20,000 square feet, or major fraction thereof, of
gross floor area when required because of the volume of receipt or
distribution, by vehicle, of material or merchandise.
   (b)   Each loading space shall be ample to accommodate the largest vehicle
anticipated.
   (c)   Subject to the limitations set forth in Section
1178.04(a), such space may occupy all or any part of any required yard or court
space.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
1310.01   STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village
Council of the Village of Lisbon, State of Ohio, does ordain the following
regulations.
(Ord. 1781. Passed 1-23-2006.)
1310.02   FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village of Lisbon has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed,
or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 1781. Passed 1-23-2006.)
1310.03   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 1781. Passed 1-23-2006.)
1310.04   METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. 1781. Passed 1-23-2006.)
1310.05   APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village of Lisbon as identified in Section
1310.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village of Lisbon.
(Ord. 1781. Passed 1-23-2006.)
1310.06   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Columbiana County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas dated April 5, 2006.
      (2)   Flood Insurance Rate Map Columbiana County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas dated April 5, 2006.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio, which has been approved
by the Village of Lisbon as required by Section
1310.26.
   (b)   Any revisions to the maps and/or studies listed in division (a) of
this section are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these
regulations. Any such maps and/or studies are on file at the Village Hall,
Lisbon, Ohio 44432.
(Ord. 1781. Passed 1-23-2006.)
1310.07   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance the more restrictive
shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction
covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be
governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 1781. Passed 1-23-2006.)
1310.08   INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 1781. Passed 1-23-2006.)
1310.09   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village of Lisbon, any elected or
appointed official, representative, elected or appointed officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 1781. Passed 1-23-2006.)
1310.10   DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory structure” means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal” is a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base flood” is the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the
one percent chance annual flood or 100-year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-year) flood elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in feet mean sea level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from one to three feet).
   (e)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure below the lowest floor.” See “Lowest floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management),” issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no Federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “Flooding” means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM)” is usually the initial map produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)” means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood insurance risk zones” are zone designations on FHBM's and
FIRM's that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   “Zone A” is special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   “Zones A1-30 and Zone AE” are special flood hazard areas inundated
by the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   “Zone AO” is special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of one to three feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   “Zone AH” is special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of one to three feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   “Zone A99" is special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   “Zone B and Zone X (shaded)” are areas of 500-year flood; areas
subject to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with
contributing drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   “Zone C and Zone X (unshaded)” are areas determined to be outside
the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” is the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood protection elevation (FPE)” is the base flood elevation plus
two feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.”
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. “Freeboard” tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” is an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary
and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. “LOMC's” are broken down into
the following categories:
      (1)   “Letter of map amendment (LOMA)” means a revision based on
technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated
special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance
rate map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special
flood hazard area.
      (2)   “Letter of map revision (LOMR)” means a revision based on technical
data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   “Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR)” means a formal review
and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A “CLOMR” does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an enclosure
below the lowest floor which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park,” as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
370 1-27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land
that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are
for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the
lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured
homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction” means structures for which the start of
construction commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of
Lisbon flood insurance rate map, September 30, 1988, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, State college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or State community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle” means a vehicle which is built on a single
chassis, 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered professional architect” is a person registered to engage
in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. Sections
4703.01 to 4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered professional engineer” is a person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor” is a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special flood hazard area,” also known as “areas of special flood
hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood
insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary
maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure, which is considered new
construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.
(Ord. 1781. Passed 1-23-2006.)

floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA, the
preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously existing
flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering these
regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and for floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
1310.33 through
1310.38.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 1781. Passed 1-23-2006.)
1310.22   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village of Lisbon specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1310.20(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation

1310.36   VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within thirty days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least five days before the date of the hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence, as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use,
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (12)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public; or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (13)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in division (c)(1) to (11) have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 1781. Passed 1-23-2006.)
1310.37   PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
   (b)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.

support of the appeal or variance.

the appeal or variance.

party or their counsel.
   (f)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become part
of the record for appeal.

attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
   (h)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter
issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable
time after the hearing.
