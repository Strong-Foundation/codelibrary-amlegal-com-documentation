EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self- identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 131.02 indicates that the code number is 1, the chapter number is 131
(or the 31st chapter within code 1), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 308.01 indicates that the code number is 3,
the chapter number is 308 (or the 8th chapter within code 3), and the section
number is .01.
 
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 560.061, 560.062 and 560.063
follow 560.06 and precede 560.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
 
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

CHARTER
OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF
GATES MILLS, OHIO
PREAMBLE
   We, the people of Gates Mills, Ohio, in order to secure for ourselves the

COUNCIL
   SECTION III-1 NUMBER AND TERM.
   The Council shall consist of seven members elected at large for terms of
four years, except as herein provided, commencing on the first day of January

disqualification for office, or for the conviction while in office of a crime
involving moral turpitude, or if adjudicated legally incompetent, or for a
violation of his or her oath of office, or for persistent failure to abide by

unless a larger number be required by the provisions of this Charter. The Clerk
of Council shall keep a record of its proceedings in a journal in which the yea

the action of Council on other measures, shall be recorded. All meetings of the
Council shall be open to the public, except as otherwise permitted by law, and

(Amended Nov. 7, 1989.)
   SECTION III-8 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The legislative powers of the Municipality, except as otherwise provided by

      (1)   The time and place of regular meetings of the Council;
      (2)   The method of calling special meetings of the Council;
      (3)   The method of giving public notice of the enactment of its
ordinances and resolutions and of any other of its acts or proceedings which it
deems proper to publish.
   (b)   The Council may by ordinance make provision for:
      (1)   The form and method of enactment of its ordinances and resolutions,
provided that no ordinance or resolution shall contain more than one subject
which shall be clearly expressed in its title, and provided further that no
ordinance or resolution of a general or permanent nature, granting a franchise,
creating a right, involving the expenditure of money or the levying of a tax
(other than a resolution providing for an election on the question of issuing
bonds or levying a tax) or for the purchase, lease, sale or transfer of
property shall be passed unless it has been read (in full or by title) on three
different days, unless the requirement for such reading be dispensed with by
the affirmative vote of five members of Council;
      (2)   The procedure for making public improvements and levying
assessments, including the procedure for combining two or more public
improvements and the levying of assessments therefor in one proceeding, if the
Council finds that it will be economical and practical to undertake such
improvements jointly, and provided that, in the event the improvements and
levying of assessments provide for the completion of the water utility service
throughout substantially all of the Village, not heretofore so serviced, that
such water improvements and assessments be provided for in a Master Plan which
shall be passed by Council.
      (3)   The procedure for the awarding of contracts, including contracts
for the purchase, lease, sale or transfer of real or personal property.
      (4)   Such other general regulations as the Council may deem necessary.
         (Amended May 2, 1995.)
   SECTION III-9 EFFECTIVE DATE OF ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS; EMERGENCY
LEGISLATION.
   Each ordinance or resolution providing for:
   (a)   The appropriation of money;
   (b)   An annual tax levy;
   (c)   Improvements petitioned for by the owners of a majority of the foot
frontage of the property benefited and to be specially assessed therefor; and
   (d)   Any emergency ordinance or resolution necessary for the immediate
preservation of the public peace, health or safety,
shall take effect, unless a later time be specified therein, upon its signature
by the Mayor approving the same, or upon the expiration of the time within
which it may be vetoed by the Mayor, or upon its passage after it has been
vetoed by the Mayor, as the case may be. All other ordinances and resolutions
shall take effect and be operative in the manner provided by the general laws
of the State of Ohio.
   Each emergency measure shall contain a statement of the necessity for such
emergency action and shall require the affirmative vote of five members of
Council for its enactment. No ordinance or resolution relating to any change in
the boundaries of the Municipality, providing for the surrender or joint
exercise of any of its powers, enacting, amending or repealing any zoning
ordinance, or granting any franchise, shall be enacted as an emergency measure.
   Notwithstanding any other provision in this Charter to the contrary, in the
event Council shall pass or has heretofore passed an ordinance or resolution as
a water service Master Plan as herein provided in Article III,
Section 8(b)(2), such ordinance or resolution shall not become effective until
Council submits such water service Master Plan ordinance or resolution to the
electorate at the next regular Municipal or general election, if one shall
occur not less than sixty days nor more than one hundred twenty days after
passage of the measure, or at a special election within the time aforesaid, and
such ordinance or resolution is approved by a majority of the electorate voting
thereon. In the event a majority of the electorate voting thereon shall approve
such water service Master Plan ordinance or resolution, no subsequent
ordinances or resolutions relating to the completion of the improvements
referred to within such Master Plan shall be submitted for approval of the
electorate. In the event Council has passed an ordinance or resolution as a
water service Master Plan prior to the May 2, 1995, election, and Council shall
have caused the Clerk to have delivered by regular mail a summary of such
Master Plan to each elector of Gates Mills whose name appears on the poll or
registration books at the last preceding general Municipal election no less
than thirty days prior to the May 2, 1995, election, and if the within Charter
Amendment shall have been approved by a majority of the electorate voting
thereon at such election, such approval shall be deemed to be an approval by
the electorate of such Master Plan as required by this section.
   Notwithstanding any other provision in this Charter to the contrary, in the
event Council shall pass an ordinance or resolution approving a new lease, or a
renegotiated existing lease, (as herein provided in Article III, Section 8
(b)1), of any parcel or parcels of Village owned land for an “unconventional
horizontal gas well”, then such ordinance or resolution shall not become
effective until Council submits such “unconventional horizontal gas well”
leasing ordinance or resolution to the electorate for approval at the next
regular Municipal or General Election. An “unconventional horizontal gas well”
shall include any well drilled more than one hundred feet vertically below the
base of the Clinton sand (or the stratigraphic equivalent), and whose boring
head then turns horizontally more than one hundred feet.
(Amended May 2, 1995; November 3, 2015)
   SECTION III-10 EMPLOYEES OF COUNCIL.
   Council may employ such persons as it deems necessary for the proper
discharge of its legislative duties, which persons shall serve at the pleasure
of Council, except as hereinafter set forth.
   SECTION III-11 SALARIES, COMPENSATION AND BONDS.
   Council shall fix the compensation of its members and of each official,
employee and member of any board or commission of the Municipality. Any such
person may be required by Council to furnish a bond for the faithful
performance of his or her duties, and Council may provide that the premium for
any such bond shall be paid by the Municipality. The compensation of the Mayor,
Clerk, Treasurer and each member of Council shall be fixed at least thirty days
before the time for filing nominating petitions for the terms beginning on the
next succeeding first day of January, and shall not thereafter be increased in
respect of any such terms or any part thereof, nor decreased except with the
consent of the official involved. The compensation of each other official,
employee and member of a board or commission shall be fixed by Council, and,
subject to the power of Council to provide otherwise by ordinance or
resolution, may be changed at any time in its discretion. Council may authorize
the payment or reimbursement for travel or other expenses incurred in the
interests of the Municipality by any official employee, or by any member of any
board or commission of the Municipality.
ARTICLE IV

   The Mayor shall have been a resident and a qualified elector of the
Municipality for at least three continuous years prior to his or her election
and shall continue to be a resident of the Municipality throughout his or her
term of office. He or she shall not hold any other public office except that of
Notary Public or member of the State Militia or Reserve Corps of the United
States, unless otherwise provided in this Charter or by ordinance of Council.
   If he or she shall cease to possess or if he or she violates any of the
qualifications herein enumerated, he or she may be removed from office, but
failure to maintain said qualifications shall not render void or ineffective
any action in which he or she has participated.
   SECTION IV-3 REMOVAL.
   The Council may remove the Mayor for gross misconduct, malfeasance,
misfeasance or nonfeasance in or disqualification for office, or for the
conviction while in office of a crime involving moral turpitude, or if
adjudicated legally incompetent, or for a violation of his or her oath of
office, provided, however, that such removal shall not take place without the
affirmative vote of five members of Council nor until the Mayor shall have been
notified in writing of the charge against him or her at least ten days in
advance of a public hearing upon such charge, and he or she or his or her
counsel has been given an opportunity at such hearing to be heard, present
evidence, and examine any witness appearing in support of the charge.
   SECTION IV-4 ABSENCE AND VACANCY.
   (a)   Absence. When the Mayor is absent from the Municipality, or for any
reason is unable to perform his or her duties as Mayor, the President pro tem
of Council shall become the acting Mayor and while so acting shall have all of
the powers and duties of the Mayor, but he or she shall continue to be
President pro tem of Council.
   (b)   Vacancy. If the office of Mayor becomes vacant, the President pro tem
of Council shall forthwith become Mayor for the unexpired term. Thereupon, the
vacancy in Council shall first be filled in the manner provided in
 Section 6  of Article III, and then a new President pro tem shall be chosen by
Council.
If the President pro tem of Council declines to serve as Mayor, Council shall
then appoint by majority vote one of its members as Mayor for the unexpired
term. If a Mayor-elect fails to qualify for office, a vacancy shall be deemed
to exist and the President pro tem of Council elected at the organization
meeting following such regular Municipal election shall become Mayor for that
term as provided above.
   SECTION IV-5 DUTIES AND POWERS.
   (a)   Executive Powers. The Mayor shall be the chief executive officer of
the Municipality. He or she shall:
      (1)   Supervise the administration of the Municipality's affairs;

wetland areas in this Municipality predominantly in their natural, scenic, open
or wooded condition or as suitable habitat for fish, plants or wildlife,
including the acquisition of such real property or interests therein as may be
necessary to carry out that purpose. The amount of taxes in each year so levied
pursuant to this Section shall not be subject to the limitations on the rate of
taxation provided in this Charter and shall be in addition to any taxes levied
by Council pursuant to any provision of this Charter or the general laws of the
State of Ohio. There is hereby established a special fund of the Municipality,

proceeds of the tax levied pursuant to this Section shall be deposited. Moneys
credited to that fund shall be invested in such investments as permitted by law
provided, however, that all investment earnings (including interest earnings)

phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by
legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.
(ORC 1.42)
 
   (b)   Singular and Plural; Gender; Tense. As used in these Codified

      (1)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day; except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may
be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.
      (3)   “Legal holiday,” as used in divisions (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this
section, means the following days:
         A.   The first day of January, known as New Year’s day;
         B.   The third Monday in January, known as Martin Luther King day;
         C.   The third Monday in February, known as Washington-Lincoln day;
         D.   The day designated in the “Act of June 28, 1968,” 82 Stat. 250, 5

   (f)   Exceptions. These rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
   111.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF RE-ENACTMENT, AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing provision of these Codified Ordinances does
not revive the provision originally repealed nor impair the effect of any
saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
 
   (b)   The re-enactment, amendment, or repeal of these Codified Ordinances
does not, except as provided in division (c) of this section:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the provision or any prior action
taken thereunder.
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation, or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded, or incurred thereunder.
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture, or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal.
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding, or remedy in respect of any
privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture, or punishment; and the
investigation, proceeding, or remedy may be instituted, continued, or enforced,
and the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment imposed, as if the provision had not
been repealed or amended.
   (c)   If the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment for any offense is reduced
by a re-enactment or amendment of these Codified Ordinances, the penalty,
forfeiture, or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according
to these Codified Ordinances as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
   111.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
section or an inclusive group of sections, or of divisions or subdivisions of a
section, such reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any provision
of the section, sections, divisions or subdivisions included in the reference.
 
   (b)   References in these Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized
under designated sections of these Codified Ordinances include, in every case,
action taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by these Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   (c)   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof,
the reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered, unless the subject matter be
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
(ORC 1.55)
   111.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
 
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.
Amendments are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably
be put into simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   111.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
 
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
 
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council, may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   111.08 SEPARABILITY.
   If any provisions of a section of these Codified Ordinances or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the section or
related sections which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application, and to this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   111.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   (a)   Whenever, in these Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00), a term of imprisonment not
exceeding six months, or both. A separate offense shall be deemed committed
each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.
 
   (b)   Whoever is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of these
Codified Ordinances shall be imprisoned for a definite term or fined, or both,
which term of imprisonment and fine shall be fixed by the court as provided in
this section.
 
Misdemeanor    Maximum Term    Maximum

CHAPTER 113
Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observances throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt an entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   There are no sections in Chapter
113. This chapter has been established to provide a place for cross references
and any future legislation.

Investments described below. The Treasurer is authorized to pool cash balances
of the several funds of the Village for investment.
   (d)    Objectives. The achievement of sound fiscal management for the
Village requires effective investment of the Public Moneys of the Village. To
that effect, the following investment objectives which shall all be of equal
priority shall be applied in the investment of Public Moneys of the Village,
with the achievement of each such objective being measured against the
investment portfolio as a whole and not against an individual Eligible
Investment:
      (1)   Safety of Principal. Credit risk shall be minimized by diversifying
and maintaining adequate collateralization. Market risk shall be minimized by
maintaining adequate liquidity so that current obligations can be met without a
sale of securities; diversification of maturities; and diversification of
assets.
       (2)   Liquidity. The Village's investments shall remain sufficiently
liquid to enable the Village to meet its operating requirements that might
reasonably be anticipated.
      (3)   Yield. The portfolio shall be managed to consistently attain a

accordance with the provisions of this policy. The Treasurer may delegate the
authority to invest the Public Moneys of the Village hereunder to an. employee
or employees of the Village, or the Village's Investment Advisor.
   The Treasurer is authorized and directed to recommend to Council an
Investment Advisor to manage and invest Public Monies in a manner consistent
with the Village of Gates Mills Investment Policy. Council must approve the
selection of the Investment Advisor and any contract pertaining to the
Advisor's services. The Treasurer, at the Treasurer's discretion and consistent
with the Investment Advisor contract, may terminate the Investment Advisor
contract and recommend a new Investment Advisor to Village Council. The
Treasurer may also, at the Treasurer's discretion, recommend one or more
additional Investment Advisors to Council.
   Once approved by Village Council, each approved Investment Advisor may
execute the purchase and/or sale of Public Monies on behalf of the Village in a
manner consistent with this section without the prior approval of the
Treasurer. Each Advisor will be provided a copy of this section of the Codified
Ordinances, as amended from time to time, and each Investment Advisor shall
agree in writing to comply with the provisions of this section.
   Officers and employees of the Village involved in making investment
decisions shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict
with the proper execution and management of the investment program of the
Village, or that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions
regarding the Village's investments.
   The Treasurer and the Treasurer's designee, the Mayor, the Law Director and
Councilmembers shall not be held accountable or personally liable for any loss
occasioned by the sale of any eligible investment if the investment policy has
been followed. Council shall take appropriate measures to protect and defend
these individuals.
   The Treasurer or the Treasurer's designee, shall maintain accounts in which
the Treasurer shall make appropriate entries of all transactions relating to
the investment of Public Moneys. Interest earned on any eligible investments
shall be collected and credited to the proper fund of the Village as required
by law.

an investment.

Council, and a written record of which approval shall be maintained:

(Res. 2161. Passed 9-6-85.)
   169.02 PICK-UP OF PERS AND POLICE AND FIREMEN'S DISABILITY AND PENSION FUND
CONTRIBUTIONS.
   (a)   The Village's methods of paying salaries and providing fringe benefits
to all employees of the Village who are members of the Public Employees
Retirement System (PERS) or the Police and Firemen's Disability and Pension
Fund (the Fund) (hereinafter referred to as "employees") are hereby modified as
set forth below, in order to provide for a salary reduction pick-up of employee
contributions to PERS or to the Fund, in accordance with Section 414(h)(2) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rulings thereunder.
   (b)   The total annual salary and salary per pay period for each employee
shall be the salary otherwise payable under the applicable contracts and
applicable Village policies. Such total annual salary and salary per pay period
of each employee shall be payable by the Village in two parts:
      (1)   Deferred salary; and
      (2)   Cash salary.
   An employee's deferred salary shall be equal to that percentage of said
employee's total annual salary or salary per pay period which is required from
time to time by PERS or the Fund to be paid by an employee and shall be paid by
the Village to PERS or to the Fund on behalf of said employee as a pick-up and
in lieu of the PERS or Fund contribution otherwise payable by said employee. An
employee's cash salary shall be equal to said employee's total annual salary or
salary per pay period, less the amount of the pick-up for said employee, and
shall be payable, subject to applicable payroll deductions, to said employee.
The Village shall compute and remit its employer contributions to PERS or to
the Fund based upon an employee's total annual salary or salary per pay period,
including the aforesaid pick-up. The Village's total combined expenditures for
such employees' total salaries otherwise payable under their contracts and
applicable Village policies (including pick-up amounts), and its employer
contributions to PERS or to the Fund, shall not be greater than the amounts the
Village would have paid for those items had this provision not been in effect.
   (c)   The pick-up shall be included in an employee's total annual salary for
the purpose of computing daily rate of pay, for determining paid salary
adjustments to be made due to absence, or for any similar purpose.
 
   (d)   The pick-up by the Village of an employee's contributions to PERS or
to the Fund shall be mandatory for each such employee. No such employee shall
have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead
of having them paid by the Village to PERS or to the Fund.
   (e)   The Village specifically acknowledges that the contributions, although
designated as employee contributions for purposes of PERS and the Fund, are to
be paid by the Village in lieu of contributions by its employees.
 
   (f)   The Village shall pay to PERS and to the Fund the contributions
designated as employee contributions from the same source of funds used in
paying the salaries of the employees.
 
   (g)   The Village shall fulfill its income tax reporting and withholding
responsibilities for each employee in such manner as is required by applicable
Federal, State and local laws and regulations as they may exist at the time of
such reporting and withholding, it being the Village's understanding that
Federal and Ohio income tax laws and regulations presently require the Village
to report as an employee's gross income his or her total annual salary, less
the amount of the pick- up, that applicable portions of the Federal social
security taxes continue to apply to picked-up amounts, and that municipal
income tax laws may require the Village to report as an employee's gross income
his or her total annual salary, including the amount of the pick-up.
 
   (h)   The Clerk of the Village is hereby authorized, empowered and directed
to implement all procedures necessary in the administration of the pay of all
employees affected by this section to effect the salary reduction pick-up, as
of the effective date of this section, of all of the statutorily required
contributions to PERS and to the Fund so as to enable the employees to obtain
the resulting Federal and Ohio tax deferments and other attendant benefits.
 
   (i)   The Clerk of the Village is hereby authorized, empowered and directed
to obtain the approval of PERS and the Fund regarding the Village's
implementation of the salary reduction pick-up plan and to implement all
administrative procedures required by PERS and the Fund.
 
   (j)   The Law Director is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to seek
the approval of the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the salary
reduction pick-up plan.
 
   (k)   The salary reduction pick-up plan set forth in this section may be
amended from time to time to satisfy any additional requirements which may
arise as a result of any future amendment to Section 414(h)(2) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any future rulings thereunder.
 
   (l)   The portion of the employees' mandatory contributions to be picked up,
via salary reduction, by the Village, pursuant to this section, may be changed
from time to time by legislation adopted by the Council of the Village.
 
   (m)   The effective date of the pick-up plan set forth in this section shall
be May 26, 1991.
(Res. 2439. Passed 5-14-91.)
   169.03 DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN.
   (a)   The Village hereby adopts a Deferred Compensation Plan under the Ohio
Public Employees Deferred Compensation Program, and shall properly contract
with any "eligible employee," as defined in Ohio R.C. 145.71(A), who desires to
participate in the Plan. The Village Plan shall be the uniform Plan as
promulgated by and as amended from time to time by the Ohio Public Employees
Deferred Compensation Board.
 
   (b)   The Board is hereby authorized to administer the Plan under the
Program, and to do all things necessary or proper for the administration of the
Plan, consistent with the enabling statutes and all rules and regulations
promulgated by the Board, whether by the Ohio Administrative Code or otherwise,
and consistent with the Program Adoption Agreement executed by the Village.
 
   (c)   The Clerk and other appropriate officials of the Village are hereby
authorized and directed to do all things necessary and proper to enter into and
implement the Plan and Agreement, upon the terms and conditions thereof and of
this section.
(Ord. 2584. Passed 2-8-94.)
 
   (d)   The Mayor is hereby authorized to take whatever actions are required
by the Village as a public employer to comply with Section 457 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including the execution of any amendments,
new plan documents, annuity applications or agreements, trust agreements or
custodial account agreements for purposes of securing the assets of the current
deferred compensation plans for the Village's employees.
   (e)   The assets currently held for the benefit of employees under each
Section 457 Plan shall no longer be assets of this Village, but, by January 1,
1999, shall be held in accordance with the requirements of Section 457(g) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. (Res. 2974. Passed 12-8-98.)
   169.04 FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY.
   (a)   Family and/or Medical Leave Defined; Approved Circumstances. A family
and/or medical leave of absences is defined as all approved absences available
to eligible employees for up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave per year under
circumstances that are critical to the life of the employee's family. Leaves
may be taken:
      (1)   Upon the birth of the employee's child;
      (2)   Upon the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or
foster care;
      (3)   When the employee is needed to care for a child, spouse or parent
who has a serious health condition; and
      (4)   When the employee is unable to perform the functions of his or her
position because of a serious health condition.
 
   (b)   Eligibility. To be eligible for leave under this policy an employee:
      (1)   Must have been employed for at least twelve months in total; and
      (2)   Must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve-month
period preceding the commencement of the leave.
   The twelve-month period for which employees may be eligible for family and
medical leave will be calculated on a calendar year basis.
 
   (c)   Certification. Medical certification is required to support a claim
for leave for an employee's own serious health condition or to care for a
seriously ill child, spouse or parent. For the employee's own medical leave,
the certification must include a statement that the employee is unable to
perform the functions of his or her position. For leave to care for a seriously
ill child, spouse or parent, the certification must include an estimate of the
amount of time the employee is needed to provide care. The Village, in its
discretion, may require a second medical opinion and periodic recertifications
at its own expense.
   If medically necessary for a serious health condition of the employee or his
or her spouse, child or parent, leave may be taken on an intermittent or
reduced leave schedule. If leave is requested on this basis, however, the
Village may require the employee to transfer temporarily to an alterative
position which better accommodates recurring periods of absence or a part-time
schedule, provided that the position has equivalent pay and benefits.
 
   (d)   Spouse Employees. Spouses who are both employed by the Village are
entitled to a total of twelve weeks of leave (rather than twelve weeks each)
for the birth or adoption of a child or for the care of a sick parent.
 
   (e)   Notice. When the need for leave is foreseeable, such as the birth or
adoption of a child or planned medical treatment, the employee must provide
reasonable prior notice and make efforts to schedule such leave so as not to
disrupt Village operations. In case of illnesses, the employee will be required
to report periodically on his or her leave status and intention to return to
work.
 
   (f)   Benefit Continuation. Any employee who is granted an approved leave of
absence under this policy is advised to provide for the retention of his or her
group insurance coverages by arranging to pay the premium contributions during
the period of unpaid absence.
    If an employee elects not to return to work after completion of an approved
unpaid leave of absence, the Village may recover from the employee the cost of
any payments made to maintain the employee's insurance coverage unless the
failure to return was for reasons beyond the employee's control.
   (g)   Leave of Absence Form. A family and medical leave of absence form must
be completed in detail, signed by the employee, submitted to his or her
immediate supervisor for proper approvals and forwarded to the Clerk's Office.
If possible, the form should be submitted thirty days in advance of the
effective date of the leave.
 
   (h)   Request for Leave. All requests for family and medical leaves of
absence due to illness will include the following information attached to a
completed request form:
      (1)   Sufficient medical certification stating:
         A.   The date on which the serious health condition commenced;
         B.   The probable duration of the condition; and
         C.   The appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health
care provider regarding the condition.
      (2)   For purposes of leave to care for a child, spouse or parent, the
certificate should give an estimate of the amount of time that the employee is
needed to provide such care.
      (3)   For purposes of leave for an employee's illness, the certificate
must state that the employee is unable to perform the functions of his or her
position.
      (4)   In the case of certification for intermittent leave or leave on a
reduced leave schedule for planned medical treatment, the dates on which such
treatment is expected to be given and the duration of such treatment must be
stated.
 
   (i)   Use of Paid Benefits. Employees are required to use any paid leave,
including paid vacation, paid sick leave and paid holidays concurrent with
unpaid family and medical leave. Paid sick leave must be used concurrently with
unpaid family and medical leave if the employee is unable to work due to his or
her own serious health condition or to care for a family member with a serious
health condition, as provided for in the Family and Medical Leave Act.
 
   (j)   Workers' Compensation. When a work-related illness or injury also
causes a serious health condition and the employee elects to take Workers'
Compensation benefits, other paid leave, such as vacation, sick time and
holidays, will not be substituted, but the absence will count against the
employee's family and medical leave entitlement.

specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a

332.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.

   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which

violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long

such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the

to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to
suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit for a
violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties
authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of time the
court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for the
violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period of
suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the
provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this Traffic Code is
substantially similar.

   314.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic-control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
 
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if, at the time and place of the
alleged violation, an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently
legible to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular
section of this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that
section shall be effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
308.021 of the Traffic Code.
(ORC 4511.12)
   314.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
 
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
   314.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
314.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
314.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
314.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
   314.04  LAND-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
      (ORC 4511.131)
   314.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   314.06  FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   (Former Ohio R.C. 4511.15 from which Section
314.06 was derived was repealed by House Bill 349, effective April 20, 2012.)
   314.07 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No person shall place, maintain, or display upon or in view of any
highway any unauthorized sign, signal, marking, or device which purports to be,
is an imitation of, or resembles a traffic-control device or railroad sign or
signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from view
or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic-control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit, upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic-
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic-control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and
4511.432.
   (b)   Every prohibited sign, signal, marking, or device is a public
nuisance, and the authority having jurisdiction over the highway may remove the
same or cause it to be removed.
(ORC 4511.16)
   314.08  ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No person without lawful authority shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Knowingly move, deface, damage, destroy, or otherwise improperly
tamper with any traffic-control device, any railroad sign or signal, or any
inscription, shield, or insignia on the device, sign, or signal, or any part of
the device, sign, or signal;
      (2)   Knowingly drive upon or over any freshly applied pavement marking
material on the surface of a roadway while the marking material is in an
undried condition, and is marked by flags, markers, signs, or other devices
intended to protect it;
      (3)   Knowingly move, damage, destroy, or otherwise improperly tamper
with a manhole cover.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, whoever violates
divisions (a)(1) or (3) of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree. If a violation of division (a)(1) or (3) of this section creates a risk
of physical harm to any person, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If a violation of division (a)(1) or (3) of this section causes
serious physical harm to property that is owned, leased, or controlled by a
State or local authority, the offender is guilty of a felony to be prosecuted
under appropriate State law.
(ORC 4511.17)
   314.09 UNAUTHORIZED POSSESSION OR SALE OF DEVICES.
   (a)   As used in this section, “traffic control device” means any sign,
traffic control signal or other device conforming to and placed or erected in
accordance with the manual adopted under Ohio R.C. 4511.09 by authority of a
public body or official having jurisdiction, for the purpose of regulating,
warning or guiding traffic, including signs denoting the names of streets and

   (a)    A Law Enforcement Officer prior to the issuance of any Ticket shall
examine all the evidence of the alleged Traffic Law Violation recorded by a
traffic law photo-monitoring device to determine whether such a violation has
occurred. If the image recorded by a traffic law photo-monitoring device shows
such a violation, contains the date and time of the violation, and shows the
letter and numerals on the license plate of the vehicle involved, as well as
the state that issued the license plate, the Law Enforcement Officer may use
any lawful means to identify the Registered Owner.
   (b)    The fact that a person or entity is the Registered Owner of a motor
vehicle is prima facie
evidence that person or entity is the person who was operating the vehicle at
the time of the Traffic Law Violation.
   (c)    A certified copy of the Ticket alleging a Traffic Law Violation,
sworn to or affirmed by a Law Enforcement Officer, including the electronic
means, and the Recorded Images produced by traffic law photo-monitoring device
on the date and at the time and the location where a violation occurred, is
prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein and is admissible in a

318.05(a)(3); and
      (10)    A warning that failure to exercise one of the options prescribed
in Section

custody, or control of a lessee or renter at the time of the alleged violation.
   (d)    Failure to timely elect and perform one of the options set forth in
Section
318.05(a) above shall constitute an admission of liability of the Traffic Law
Violation and a waiver of the opportunity to contest the Traffic Law Violation.
(Ord. 2021-36. Passed 1-11-22.)
   318.06 CONTESTING TICKETS.
   (a)    When a person or entity named in a Ticket for a civil violation

must be conducted upon its own motion, or either a request for additional time
or waiver of time limits by the person or entity who requested the hearing.
Notice of the hearing shall be provided by the Lyndhurst Municipal Court. The
Lyndhurst Municipal Court shall determine whether a preponderance of the
evidence establishes that a Traffic Law Violation alleged in the Ticket did in
fact occur and that the person or entity requesting the hearing is the person
who was operating the vehicle at the time of the Traffic Law Violation.
   (c)    If as a result of the adjudication of a Ticket by the Lyndhurst
Municipal Court, the Village or its designee becomes aware that the person or
entity named in the Ticket was not the person who was operating the vehicle at

subsection (c) above, contests the Ticket by filing a written request for a
hearing and does so not later than thirty (30) days after the mailing date of
the Ticket, the Village shall require the Registered Owner of the motor vehicle
to also attend the hearing. If at the hearing involving the Designated Party
the Lyndhurst Municipal Court cannot determine the identity of the operator of
the vehicle at the time of the violation, the Registered Owner shall be liable
for the violation. The Lyndhurst Municipal Court shall then issue a written
decision imposing liability for the violation on the Registered Owner and
submit it to the Village or its designee and to the Registered Owner. If the
Designated Party, also is a Registered Owner of the vehicle, liability for the
violation shall follow the order of Registered Owners as listed on the title
to the vehicle.
   (e)    A person or entity found liable for a Ticket may appeal the decision
rendered by the Lyndhurst Municipal Court in accordance with Ohio law.
   (f)    No decision rendered under this Section, and no admission of
liability under this Chapter is admissible as evidence in any other judicial
proceeding in this state, except as is provided in Section

the mailing date of the Ticket. If the amount of the penalty is not paid within
this time, twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be imposed as a default fee.
Failure to pay the penalty and the twenty-five dollar ($25.00) default fee
within sixty (60) days from the date of the mailing of the Ticket will result
in the unpaid penalty and default fee being collected by civil suit or other
appropriate means of collection per Section
318.08 below.
(Ord. 2021-36. Passed 1-11-22.)
   318.08 COLLECTION OF CIVIL PENALTY.

take any action set forth in Section
318.05(a) or fails to satisfy any liability determined by the Lyndhurst
Municipal Court for the penalties established under this Chapter and the time
to appeal such decision has passed without the filing of an appeal, the Village
may seek to collect the amount due and owing and/or may initiate a civil
enforcement action in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain a judgment
for the civil penalty and any late fees, costs and attorney's fees that may be
imposed under this Chapter and by the Lyndhurst Municipal Court.
   (b)    If a judgment for a civil penalty under this Chapter is not
satisfied, the Village may seek payment on the judgment amount, together with
any applicable interest and cost thereon, in any manner authorized by law. In
addition to any other fees or charges authorized by this Chapter in relation to
the commission of a Traffic Law Violation thereof, a person liable for the

   (a)   Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon
the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
      (1)   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
      (2)   When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
      (4)   When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;
      (5)   When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic-control
device.
   (b)   (1)   Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the
prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
         A.   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;

except as permitted under division (a)(2) of this section.
 
   (d)   Division (c) of this section shall not be construed as prohibiting the
crossing of the center line in making a left turn into or from an alley,
private road, or driveway.
 
   (e)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section

direction;
      (2)   When the view is obstructed upon approaching within 100 feet of any
bridge, viaduct, or tunnel; or
      (3)   When approaching within 100 feet of or traversing any intersection

      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based

to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.

a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,

If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic

relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Reserved for future legislation.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term

monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court

      (6)   A physician or chiropractor who issues an affidavit for the
purposes of subsection (c)(3) or (4) of this section is immune from civil
liability arising from any injury or death sustained by the person who was
issued the affidavit due to the failure of the person to wear an occupant
restraining device unless the physician or chiropractor, in issuing the
affidavit, acted in a manner that constituted willful, wanton or reckless
misconduct.
      (7)   The Registrar shall adopt rules in accordance with Ohio R.C.
Chapter 119, establishing a process for a person to be included in the database

   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on

person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2) of this
section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort action
as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

   340.01 OVERSIZE OR OVERWEIGHT VEHICLE OPERATION ON STATE ROUTES; STATE
PERMIT.
   (a)   The Municipality, with respect to highways under its jurisdiction,
upon application in writing and for good cause shown, may issue a special
permit in writing authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles of a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the
maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in
conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, upon any highway under its
jurisdiction.
   (b)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a special
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may
move the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the special permit on
any highway that is a part of the State highway system when the movement is
partly within and partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality. No
local authority shall require any other permit or license or charge any license
fee or other charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a
vehicle or combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State
highway system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the
holder of a permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for
the movement of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the
jurisdiction of the Municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time
not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines
advisable or for the duration of any public construction project.
   (c)   The application for a permit shall be in the form that the
Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe a permit fee to be
imposed and collected when any permit described in this section is issued. The
permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse the Municipality for the
administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit, and also to cover the cost
of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway or a street or highway
structure as the result of the operation of the nonconforming vehicle or
combination of vehicles. For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted
by the Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is
deemed a nondivisible load.
   (d)   The Municipality may issue or withhold a permit. If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
   (e)   Every permit shall be carried in the vehicle or combination of
vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by any police
officer or authorized agent of any authority granting the permit. No person
shall violate any of the terms of a permit.

department in the discharge of its functions. This section does not apply to
vehicles and pole trailers used in the transportation of wooden and metal

or equipment not specifically enumerated in this section but the dimensions of
which exceed the dimensions provided by this section, when operating the same
on the highways and streets of this State shall comply with the rules of the
Director governing such movement, that the Director may adopt. Ohio R.C. 119.01

R.C. 3781.111(C) shall be mounted on a fixed or movable post, and the distance
from the ground to the bottom edge of the sign shall measure not less than five
feet. If a new sign or a replacement sign designating an accessible parking
location is posted on or after October 14, 1999, there also shall be affixed
upon the surface of that sign or affixed next to the designating sign a notice

removed shall not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of
ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the

the person was issued the ticket or citation and that, because of the injury,
the person meets at least one of the criteria contained in Ohio R.C. 4503.44(A)

person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is
displaying a removable windshield placard or accessible license plates, or when
a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a person with a
disability, and is displaying a parking card or accessible license plates, the
motor vehicle is permitted to park for a period of two hours in excess of the
legal parking period permitted by local authorities, except where local
ordinances or police rules provide otherwise or where the vehicle is parked in
such a manner as to be clearly a traffic hazard.
   (h)   No owner of an office, facility, or parking garage where accessible
parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with subsection
(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license
plates if the parking card or accessible license plates, issued to the person

any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
      (2)   For purposes of this division (e), the fact that a motor vehicle
has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie evidence of
abandonment.
      (3)   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of

   506.02 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are

due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the

         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years

division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
506.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental

      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)

   506.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
506.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   506.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   506.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
   506.10  FALSIFICATION.

following applies:

or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the

a result of making that report or participating in that proceeding so long as
the person is acting in good faith without fraud or malice.

knowledge of a licensed medical professional’s commission of an offense or
violation reported under subsection (f)(1) of this section, against that
licensed medical professional in any judicial proceeding resulting from a
report made under that division.

patient’s or client’s records.

religious counseling purpose of a professional character; husband and wife; or
a communications assistant and those who are a party to a telecommunications
relay service call.
      (2)   The information would tend to incriminate a member of the actor’s
immediate family.
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to Ohio R.C.
5119.36.

actor in the course of the actor’s duties in connection with a bona fide

violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.05 or to victims of felonious sexual
penetration in violation of former Ohio R.C. 2907.12. As used in this
subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide
those services.

misdemeanor of the first degree.
   506.20 INTERFERING WITH CIVIL RIGHTS.

   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in

degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a

of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.

R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.

institution, or the merchant or his employee or agent acting under subsection
(a) or (b) hereof shall not search the person, search or seize any property
belonging to the person detained without the person's consent, or use undue

probable cause to believe has committed any act described in subsection (b)(1)
or (2) hereof or that he has probable cause to believe has committed an

shall be made within a reasonable time after the commission of the act or
unlawful taking.

act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the

part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a

become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.

worth or its lack of quality and worth”.

misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.

2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if

license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

Ohio R.C. Chapters 2925 or 3719, a laboratory report from the Bureau of
Criminal Identification and Investigation or a laboratory operated by another
law enforcement agency, or a laboratory established by or under the authority
of an institution of higher education that has its main campus in this State
and that is accredited by the Association of American Universities or the North
Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, primarily for the
purpose of providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed
by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer’s regular duties, and giving an outline of
the signer’s education, training, and experience for performing an analysis of

attorney of record for the accused, or on the accused if the accused has no
attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
 
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance if the accused or the accused’s attorney demands the testimony of the
person signing the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney,
within seven days from the accused or the accused’s attorney’s receipt of the
report. The time may be extended by a trial judge in the interests of justice.

benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by
the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis
and that can be used by an analyst in arriving at conclusions, findings, or
opinions concerning the identity of the substance or substances subject to the
analysis.

any person who is accused of a violation of this chapter or Ohio R.C. Chapters
2925 or 3719 that involves a bulk amount of a controlled substance, or any
multiple thereof, or who is accused of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, other than a minor misdemeanor
violation, that involves marihuana, is entitled, upon written request made to
the prosecuting attorney, to have a laboratory analyst of the accused’s choice,
or, if the accused is indigent, a qualified laboratory analyst appointed by the
court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

the offender pleaded guilty to or was convicted of a violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.19 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance or the law of another
state or the United States arising out of the same set of circumstances as the

R.C. 2925.51, or in any other manner on any substance that was the basis of, or
involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance contained any
amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests indicate that the

   (d)   A retailer or employee of a retailer is not liable for damages in a
civil action for injury, death or loss to person or property that allegedly
arises from an act or omission associated with a failure to prevent the sale of

of subsection (c) hereof, both of the following apply:
            1.   For purposes of the provisions of the Traffic Code penalty
that set forth the penalties and sanctions for a violation of Section
334.01(a) of the Traffic Code, the conviction of or plea of guilty to the

of Section

determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
542.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
542.05,
542.06, or
542.08,
542.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
542.15 or
542.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
542.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
542.05 or
542.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
542.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
542.05,
542.06 or
542.08, Section
542.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
542.15 or
542.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
542.05 or
542.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, “fair
market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

   542.25 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
542.09:
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality,    and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, “fair market value” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Ohio
R.C. 2913.61(D), may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to
this section.

trespass under Ohio R.C. 2911.21 or under any other criminal law of this State
or criminal law, ordinance, or resolution of a political subdivision of this
State, and instead is subject only to a civil cause of action for trespass

substantially equivalent state law or municipal ordinance, or of any offense of
violence, if the weapon involved is a firearm that is either loaded or for

         (ORC 2935.36(E))
   598.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor shall be guided by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor
sentencing. The overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect
the public from future crime by the offender and others and to punish the
offender. To achieve those purposes, the sentencing court shall consider the
impact of the offense upon the victim and the need for changing the offender's
behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and making restitution to the victim of
the offense, the public, or the victim and the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor shall be
reasonably calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor
sentencing set forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and
not demeaning to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon
the victim, and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses
committed by similar offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic
background, gender, or religion of the offender.
(ORC2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
566.99 or
598.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 and unless another term is
required or authorized pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a
jail term on the offender pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a
definite jail term that shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under division
(b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
(ORC2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
 566.99 and
598.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate, including, but not
limited to, requiring that the offender not ingest or be injected with a drug
of abuse and submit to random drug testing and requiring that the results of
the drug test indicate that the offender did not ingest or was not injected
with a drug of abuse. If the court imposes a jail term upon the offender, the
court may impose any community control sanction or combination of community
control sanctions in addition to the jail term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (3)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator a longer time under
the same community control sanction if the total time under all of the
community control sanctions imposed on the violator does not exceed the five-
year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section or may impose on the
violator a more restrictive community control sanction or combination of
community control sanctions, including a jail term. If the court imposes a jail
term upon a violator pursuant to this division, the total time spent in jail
for the misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community
control sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the
offense for which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may
reduce the longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under
the longer sanction or the more restrictive sanction by all or part of the time
the violator successfully spent under the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (4)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   A term of up to 180 days in an alternative residential facility
or a term in an alternative residential facility not to exceed the longest jail
term available for the offense, whichever is shorter. The court may specify the
level of security in the alternative residential facility that is needed for
the offender.
      (2)   The court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, alternative
residential facility, or other place at which the offender will serve the
residential sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the
operation of the halfway house, alternative residential facility, or other
place may cause the convicted offender to be examined and tested for
tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to,
hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious diseases. The person in charge of
th operation of the halfway house, alternative residential facility, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, alternative residential facility, or
other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV
infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, or
another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, a term of
electronic monitoring without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without
electronic monitoring;
         C.   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor of
the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or fourth
degree;
         D.   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for

         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially similar municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially similar
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (3)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
(ORC2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.  
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor committed
under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor misdemeanor, may sentence the
offender to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions
authorized under this section and, if the offender is being sentenced for a
criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall sentence the offender
to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio R.C. 2929.281. If the
court, in its discretion or as required by this section, imposes one or more
financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to
this section include, but are not limited to, the following:
      A.   Restitution.  
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
   4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
   5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
            1.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000);
            2.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
            3.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
            4.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
            5.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
      C.   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (f)
(1)C.1. of this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the
offender is able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.
The court may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to
pay under that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
(ORC 2929.28)
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(3) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund in accordance with division (f)(8) of this section. The
County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs incurred by
the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of
this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a
sanction imposed under division (d) of this section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund in accordance with
division (f)(8) of this section. The municipal corporation shall use the
amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs incurred by the municipal
corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of
this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders pursuant to a
sanction imposed under division (d) of this section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(4), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is a judgment in favor of the victim of the
offender's criminal act. The offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment, the victim,
private provider, state, or political subdivision may bring an action to do any
of the following:
            1.   Obtain execution of the judgment through any available
procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C. 2929.18(D)
(1)(a) to (e) or a substantially similar municipal ordinance.
            2.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially similar municipal ordinance.
      (5)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(4) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (6)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (7)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (8)   Reimbursement imposed under division (f)(1)C. of this section to
pay the costs incurred by a county or municipal corporation shall be paid to
the General Fund of the county or municipal corporation that incurred the
expenses in question, as described in division (f)(3) of this section.
(ORC2929.28)
   (g)   Whoever violates any provision of this General Offenses Code, for
which no penalty is otherwise provided, is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree.
   598.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
 598.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
566.99 or
598.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
598.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
598.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
598.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
598.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
   598.04  ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
598.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
506.08 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
506.08, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
   598.05  MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(E), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a
prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

   598.06  MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 598.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and
revision of these Codified Ordinances because substantially identical State law
(Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
   598.07  SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law , may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

   791.05 DETERMINATION OF TAX ALLOCATION.
   (a)   Method of Determination. This Section
791.05 does not apply to taxpayers that are subject to and required to file
reports under Chapter 5745 of the Revised Code.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in Section
791.05(a)(4), for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2008, the net
profits from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the Village for
purposes of imposing the Village income tax to the extent of the amount
determined by multiplying the entire net profits by a business allocation
percent determined by the average ratio of the following:
         A.   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all the real
and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in this subsection (a)(1)(a), “real property” shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereof by eight (8).
         B.   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed, excluding compensation that is not taxable by the
Village under Section 718.011 of the Revised Code.
         C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed. In the event that the foregoing apportionment
formula does not produce an equitable result, another basis may be substituted,
under the Rules and Regulations, so as to produce an equitable result.
      (2)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2008, no
taxpayer shall use the books and records method of apportionment. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 718.02 of the Revised Code and subsection (a)
hereof, all taxpayers shall use the statutory apportionment formula set forth
in this section.
      (3)    Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) hereof, for taxable
years beginning on or after January 1, 2008, the net profits from rental
activity not constituting a business or profession shall be subject to tax by
the Village only if the property generating the net profit is located in the
Village.
      (4)    This Section shall not apply to individuals who are residents of
the Village and, except as otherwise provided in Section 718.01 of the Revised
Code, the Village shall impose its tax on all income earned and/or received by
residents of the Village from whatever source derived in accordance with
Section
791.03 of this chapter.
   (b)    Sales Made in the Village. As used in Section
791.05(a)(3)(c), “sales made in the Village” means:
      (1)    All sales of tangible personal property delivered within the
Village regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a stock
of goods within the Village;
      (2)    All sales of tangible personal property delivered within the
Village regardless of where title passes even though transported from a point
outside the Village, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village, and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion; or
      (3)    All sales of tangible personal property shipped from a place
within the Village to purchasers outside of the Village regardless of where
title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
   (c)    Total Allocation.  Add together the percentages determined in
accordance with Section
791.05 (a)(1)(a), (a)(1)(b), and (a)(1)(c), or such of the aforesaid
percentages as are applicable to the particular taxpayer, and divide the total
so obtained by the number of percentages used in deriving the total in order to
obtain the business allocation percentage referred to in Section
791.05(a)(1). A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely
within or without the Village.
   (d)    Rentals. Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in
the computation of net profits from business activities under divisions (c) to
(e) of Section
791.03, only if and to the extent that the rental, ownership, management or
operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived, whether so
rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer individually or through agents or
other representatives, constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole
or in part.
   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties, regardless of
number and value, aggregates in excess of one hundred twenty-five dollars
($125.00) per month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties, is a business activity
of such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject
to tax. However, in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed
or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits, of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds of one hundred twenty- five dollars
($125.00) per month; provided further that in the case of farm property, the
owner shall be considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in
crops or when the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts
derived from the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds of one hundred
twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per month. It is provided further that the person
who operates a licensed rooming house shall be considered in business whether
or not the gross income exceeds of one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00)
per month.
   (e)    Operating Loss; Carry Forward.
      (1)    The portion of a net operating loss sustained in any taxable year
subsequent to January 1, 1968, allocable to the Village may be applied against
the portion of the net profit of succeeding tax years allocable to the Village,
until exhausted but in no event for more than five (5) taxable years
immediately following the year in which the loss occurred. No portion of a net
operating loss shall be carried back against net profits of any prior year.
      (2)    The portion of net operating loss sustained shall be allocated to
the Village in the same manner as provided herein for allocating net profits to
the Village.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator shall provide by Rules and Regulations the
manner in which such net operating loss carry forward shall be determined.

the federal income tax return by using the Ohio Business Gateway will receive
an extension to file the Village income tax return for the same taxable year
provided that, the requirements of Section 718.051 of the Revised Code are met.
In accordance with that Section, the extended due date will be the last day of
the same month to which the due date for filing the federal return has been
extended.
      (8)    Extensions to file the Village income tax return granted through

of corporations subject to the tax imposed by this chapter is required to file
a consolidated return or files a consolidated return in accordance with this

stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the Village
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Tax Administrator shall
require such additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to the Village. If the Tax
Administrator finds that net profits are not properly allocated to the Village
by reason of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related
by stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such
division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other
method, the Tax Administrator shall make such allocation to produce a fair and
proper allocation of net profits to the Village.

(Ord. 2007-55. Passed 12-11-07.)
   791.11 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES; REFUNDS.
   (a)    Unpaid Taxes Recoverable as Other Debts. All taxes imposed by this
chapter shall be collectible, together with any interest and penalties thereon,
by suit, as other debts of like amount are recoverable. Except in the case of
fraud, omission of a substantial portion of income subject to the tax or
failure to file a return, an additional assessment shall not be made after
three years from the time the return was due or filed, whichever is later,
provided, however, that in those cases in which a Commissioner of Internal

limitations, the period within which an additional assessment may be made by
the Administrator shall be one year from the time of the final determination of
the Federal tax liability.
   (b)   Refund of Taxes Erroneously Paid.
      (1)    Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for

of computing the payment of interest on overpayments, no amount of Village
income tax for any taxable year shall be treated as having been paid before the
date on which the Village income tax return for that taxable year was due,
without regard to any extension of time for filing that return. Interest on any
overpayment of Village income tax shall be paid at the rate of interest
prescribed by Sections 718.12 and 5703.47 of the Revised Code.
   (c)   Amounts Less Than One Dollar. Amounts of less than one dollar ($1.00)

   791.12 VILLAGE RESIDENT SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (a)   Credit. 
      (1)    A resident of the Village who is required to and does pay, or
acknowledges liability for, a municipal tax on or measured by income, to
another municipality upon the same income taxable under this chapter, may claim
a credit of one-half of the first one percent of tax paid by him or her or on
his or her behalf to such other municipality, but not in excess of fifty
percent of the tax assessed by this chapter on such income. For the purposes of
this section, taxable income shall include the distributive share of net
profits of a resident partner or owner of an unincorporated business entity.
However, a resident of the Village shall not be entitled to such credit if he
or she fails, neglects or refuses to timely file a return or form as is
prescribed by the Administrator and required by this chapter.
      (2)    In the event a resident is entitled to credit for taxes paid
another municipality, such resident is required to file a return on a form in
such manner as the Tax Administrator may prescribe.
      (3)    Assignment of any claim for refund to which a resident may be
entitled from another municipality shall be tentatively accepted as payment of
that portion of Village income tax represented by such assignment. However, if
satisfactory evidence is offered that the taxpayer is entitled to the claim
covered by the assignment, such taxpayer shall not be deprived of credit
therefore because of fault or neglect on the part of either municipality.
      (4)    In the event such resident fails, neglects or refuses to file such
return or form as is prescribed by the Tax Administrator, such resident shall
not be entitled to such credit and shall be considered in violation of this
chapter for failure to file a return and make payment of taxes due hereunder.
      (5)    A resident owner of a pass-through entity that does not conduct
business in the Village and that has paid an income tax to another municipality
may claim a credit equal to the lesser of (i) the resident owner’s
proportionate share of the amount, if any, of income tax paid by the pass-
through entity to another municipality in the State; or (ii) the resident
owner’s proportionate share of the amount of Village income tax that would be
imposed on the pass-through entity if the pass-through entity conducted
business in the Village.
      (6)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under division
(e) of this Section exceed the tax assessed by this chapter on the resident
owner’s taxable income subject to tax by another municipality.
      (7)    The credits provided in Sections 718.021 and 718.121 of the
Revised Code shall be available to residents, if applicable.
      (8)    Except as otherwise provided in Sections 718.021, 718.121 and
718.14 of the Revised Code, this chapter and the Rules and Regulations, where a
nonresident is subject to the tax imposed by this chapter and is subject to tax
on the same taxable income in the municipality where such nonresident resides,
no credit against the Village income tax levied by this chapter shall be
allowed.
   (b)    Claim for Credit. Any claim for credit for taxes paid by a resident
to another municipality on the same income taxable under this chapter or claim
for or assignment of any refund due to the credit provided for in Section
791.12 must be filed with the Tax Administrator on a form acceptable to the Tax
Administrator within three (3) years from the due date of the Village income
tax return. If the resident, fails, neglects, or refuses to file such claim for
refund or credit within the time prescribed by this section, such failure,
neglect, or refusal shall render such credit, claim for refund, or assignment
null and void and the resident shall be liable for the full amount of tax
assessed by this chapter, together with interest and penalties.

Chapter that is not otherwise defined in this Chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax

tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised

agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting

unless one of the following conditions applies:
   (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the Municipality.
   (b)   The employee performed services at one or more presumed worksite
locations in the Municipality. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in
this state at which the employer provides services that can reasonably be
expected by the employer to last more than twenty (20) days in a calendar year.
Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than twenty
(20) days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
   (i)   The nature of the services are such that it will require more than
twenty (20) days of actual services to complete the services;
   (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to perform
services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services at the
location for more than twenty (20) days.
   (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested that
the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided in
Section
792.051 of this Chapter.
   (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional entertainer, or
public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the performance of
services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
(2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee shall be
considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal corporation
only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of
the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
   (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first perform
services for the employer for the day;
   (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
   (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick up or
load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has been
purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
   (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)(c) of
this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee does
not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned, used,
or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
   (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the employee's
final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's principal place
of work or a location at which the employee will not perform services for the
employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
Chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
(2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal corporation
under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for that
municipal corporation for the first twenty (20) days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
(3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of this
section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those first
twenty (20) days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's principal
place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
792.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
792.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve (12) or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the
employer is located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes
a tax applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on
those days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for
tax on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this
division, a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial
classification code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve (12) days for which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar
year on which the individual performed services at the refinery.

792.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
    (A)    The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
Section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than

   (C)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
(1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall file
a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the Municipality,
providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
(2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino operator

withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for that
reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual return.
(3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino operator
shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom an amount
has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year. The

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
(5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits the
casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall withhold

deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon until the
predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
(a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts deducted
and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
(b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts are
due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
(6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the required
amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from liability for
the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by Section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery

persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
(3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
(4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
(5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video lottery
sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with respect to
whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income
tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video lottery
sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent shall
provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of each
information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
(6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted and
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video

and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
(2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts are
due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
(1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and

Section
792.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

Municipality is calculated as follows:
(A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included in
income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
(1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net Profit"
of the taxpayer.
(i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in Section
792.03(23).
(ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
792.03(1) of this Chapter.
(2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
792.03(11) of this Chapter.
(3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

(4)   "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
792.03 (32) of this Chapter.
         (Source: ORC 718.01) (Ord. 2015-28. Passed 11-11-15.)
792.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(A)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (B) and (I) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
(1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
(2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to
individuals employed in the business or profession for services performed in
the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever the
individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which taxes
are not required to be withheld under Section
792.052 of this Chapter;
(3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and rentals
made and services performed during the taxable period in the Municipality to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
(B) (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
(a)   Separate accounting;
(b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
(c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would provide for a
more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the Municipality;
(d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
(2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall be in
writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an assessment,
or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the requested
alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in an
assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
792.19 of this Chapter.
(3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
792.19 of this Chapter.
(4)    Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise affects
any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax Administrator or
otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and taxpayer before January
1, 2016.
(C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and other
compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid to an
employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
(1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or under the
possession of one of the following:
   (a)   The employer;
(b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a related
member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
(c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in division
(C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor, customer,
client, or patient.
(2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation, inquiry,
review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or legislative
matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the compensation is paid
for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer or that the
employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits the
employer;
(3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the employer
directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in lieu of
a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely in order
to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a Tax
Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
(D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from sales
and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
(1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title passes,

   (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
   (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from a
location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is regularly
engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such solicitation
or promotion.
      (Ord. 2018-06. Passed 4-10-18.) 
(2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
(3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of real
property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the municipal
corporation.
(4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and royalties
from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
(5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
(E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of real
estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned by the
individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in which
the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal corporation
in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
(F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section, and except
as provided in division (I) of this section, commissions received by a real
estate agent or broker relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the real estate is
located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or broker shall be
allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the municipal corporation to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
(2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that imposes a
municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from all real
estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that municipal
corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the individual paid on
such net profit to another municipal corporation to the extent that such credit
is allowed under Section
792.081 of this Chapter.
(G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
792.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
(H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section for
the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of a
disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
792.051 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (B) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(B)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (I)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (B)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (B)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (B)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (B)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
792.051 of this Chapter.

intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year

792.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
(3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least eighty
percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in

consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
792.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so

purpose of making the computations required in Section
792.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
(4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
   (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax return
shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
792.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
   (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income taxation
as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

make the computations required under Section
792.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this

member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

(a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid to the
municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts on
each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts
were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as paid on the
dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
(b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable year is
deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in which the
payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds transfer, the

(c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the beginning of
the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability

section.
(3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year following
that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid with the
return in accordance with Section
792.091 of this Chapter.
(a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and are
reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is due on
the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended pursuant
to division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
(b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and filing on a
fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the annual return
is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxable year or period.

year.

(90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
(2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
(1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by

immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
(2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one hundred
percent (100%) of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
municipal corporation under Section

(3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes

792.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
792.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   A resident of the Municipality who is required to and does pay, or
acknowledges liability for, a municipal tax on or measured by income, to
another municipality upon the same income taxable under this Chapter, may claim
a credit for one-half of the first one percent (1%) of tax paid by him or her
or on his or her behalf to such other municipality, but not in excess of fifty
percent (50%) of the tax assessed by this Chapter on such income. For the
purposes of this section, taxable income shall include the distributive share
of the net profits of a resident partner or owner of an unincorporated business
entity. However, a resident of the Municipality shall not be entitled to such
credit if he or she fails, neglects or refuses to timely file a return or form
as is prescribed by the Tax Administrator and/or as required by this Chapter.
   (B)   In the event a resident is entitled to credit for taxes paid another
municipality, such resident is required to file a return on a form in such
manner as the Tax Administrator may prescribe and/or as required by this
Chapter.
   (C)   Assignment of any claim for refund to which a resident may be entitled
from another municipality shall be tentatively accepted as payment of that
portion of Village income tax represented by such assignment. However, if
satisfactory evidence is offered that the taxpayer is entitled to the claim
covered by the assignment, such taxpayer shall not be deprived of credit
therefore, because of fault or neglect on the part of either municipality.
   (D)   In the event such resident fails, neglects or refuses to file such
return or form as prescribed by the Tax Administrator or this Chapter, such
resident shall not be entitled to such credit and shall be considered in
violation of this Chapter for failure to file a return and make payment of
taxes due hereunder.
   (E)   A resident owner of a pass-through entity that does not conduct
business in the Municipality and that has paid an income tax to another
municipality may claim a credit equal to the lesser of (i) the resident owner's
proportionate share of the amount, if any, of income tax paid by the pass-
through entity to another municipality in the State; or (ii) the resident
owner's proportionate share of the amount of Village income tax that would be
imposed on the pass-through entity if the pass-through entity conducted
business in the Municipality.
   (F)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this section
exceed the tax assessed by this Chapter on the resident owner's taxable income
subject to tax by another municipality.

described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
(b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to one or
more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
(c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the taxpayer
sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the taxpayer
receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
(3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable year
for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
(2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from each
municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
(3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
(4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this section
exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a municipal
corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
(2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise credited for
the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the municipal
corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
(1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
(2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's
terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
792.081 of this Chapter.

limitation on refunds as provided in Section
792.096 of this Chapter.
   
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
792.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
792.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
792.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.

the appropriate Tax Administrator.
(5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall request,
and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or documents
required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
(6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal income tax
returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify credits, income,
losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be included to
avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator of
undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date

   (Ord. 2018-06. Passed 4-10-18; Ord. 2023-37. Passed 11-21-23.)
(2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure the
payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this Chapter,
the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments
otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise
required to file annual returns.
(3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
792.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this

792.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
792.092 of this Chapter prevails.

not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.

section, unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to Municipality income tax ordinance
for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with
Municipality for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(l)(g))
within Municipality.
            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in Municipality and
does not expect to be subject to Municipality income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within Municipality. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within Municipality. make any sales in Municipality, or otherwise
become subject to the tax levied by Municipality during the taxable year. If
the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by Municipality for the
taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly
comply as a taxpayer with Municipality income tax ordinance and rules and
regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
            (Ord. 2018-06. Passed 4-10-18.)
   (I)    (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this Chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
(2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp assigned by
the first electronic system receiving that payment. For purposes of this
section, “receiving that payment” refers to the transfer of funds from the
account of the taxpayer, as such funds are no longer under the control of the
taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred.
         (Ord. 2016-25. Passed 9-13-16.)
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
792.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
792.052 of this Chapter.
(2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not expect
to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable year
if both of the following conditions apply:
   (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this Chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this Chapter.
   (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal corporation,
and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's income tax for
the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
   (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of this
section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any tax
return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses information
that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the
affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results in work
being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that results
in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the taxable year.
It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the provisions of
this Chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal taxable income
on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit has been filed
with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in division (N) of
this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an audit of the
person.

   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter. The application
shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
(2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified for an
extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to file
any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
(3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)(1) of
this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any

division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
(2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under the
Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to file
any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in which to
make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance with this
Chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this
section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the
taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this section,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of the
United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
(b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with division (C)(2)
(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such taxes
become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension period
if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for
the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any period of
extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in calculating the
penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that

taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal

party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Source: ORC 718.051)(Ord. 2015-28.

   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of a
municipal income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be
the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this chapter is
not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator
grants an extension of that date.
      (1)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with the
filing of Municipality’s income tax return.
      (2)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (B)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (C)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (A) or (B) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
   If a tax administrator violates division (C) of this section, the municipal
corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
   Division (C) of this section does not apply to an extension received under
division (A) of this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that
the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the
extension under division (A) of this section or failed to file for an extension
under division (A)(2) of this section.
   (D)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
792.092 of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
792.092 of this chapter, the provision in Section 792.092 of this chapter
prevails.

   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this Chapter must be altered.
(2)   Within sixty (60) days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.   
(3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income
tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
792.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
(2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax that
would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of this
section for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less, no
refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in
division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
792.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
(2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund that
would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
(1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
(2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten dollars
($10.00).
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
(2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall determine
the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate municipal
corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)(3) of this
section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose
request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment shall state the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for appealing the assessment.
(3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
792.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not later
than the last day for filing the request.
(2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark on the
cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal meter,

postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
(7) days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety (90) days after the final filing date of the annual
return or (90) ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is
later, no interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing
the payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable
year shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return
on which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described
in division (A)(4) of Section
792.10 of this Chapter.

   (C)   The Municipality shall impose on a taxpayer, employer, any agent of
the employer, and any other payer, and will attempt to collect, the interest

Municipality any return required to be filed.
(1)   Interest shall be imposed at the rate defined as "interest rate as

(2)   With respect to unpaid income tax and unpaid estimated income tax, a
penalty equal to fifteen percent of the amount not timely paid shall be
imposed.
(3)   With respect to any unpaid withholding tax, a penalty not exceeding fifty
percent of the amount not timely paid shall be imposed. (Ord. 2018-06. Passed
4-10-18.)
      (4)   (a)    For tax years ending on or before December 31, 2022, with
respect to returns other than estimated income tax returns, the Municipality
shall impose a monthly penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each failure

appropriate. Such abatement or partial abatement shall be properly documented
and maintained on the record of the taxpayer who received benefit of such
abatement or partial abatement.

792.11 AUDIT.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, as defined in Section
792.03(3) of this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer
a written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right

an audit, the Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

792.12 ROUNDING.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.

792.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
(1)   Compromise a claim;
(2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and

compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.

financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Source: ORC 718.28)(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 11-11-15.)
792.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

792.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty (30) days of making the request, nothing in this
Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person
to whom the request was directed pursuant to Section
792.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
792.99 of this Chapter.
(2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying
information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with respect to
that information as required under division (A) of this section within thirty
(30) days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
792.10 of this Chapter.
(3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this section
may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with respect to
which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to any
applicable criminal penalties described in Section
792.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
792.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Source: ORC 718.26)(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 11-11-15.)
792.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this Chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.

792.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,

document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.

792.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific facts
or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the income,
source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or transaction,
all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly identified by
name, location, or other pertinent facts.
(2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance
with this Chapter.
(3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator and
designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
(1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator sent
to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective date
of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year after the
issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
(2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant section of
the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's income tax
ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and conclusion of the
opinion of the Tax Administrator;
(3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or changing
relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law,
or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
(4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the interpretation
of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant federal
statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
(5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts or
circumstances;
(6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified in the
opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
(2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
792.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
(1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change for
any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
(2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Source: ORC 718.38)(Ord. 2015-28. Passed 11-11-15.)
792.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative
means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by
secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be authorized by
the person subject to the assessment.
(3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax Administrator or
other municipal official, or the designee of either, the person to whom the
assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty (60) days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator as
prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
(2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described in
division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

792.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
(2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
(3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by the
legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no limit
on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be reappointed
by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
(4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative authority
may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section 718.11(A)
(4) of the Revised Code.
(5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
(6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner as the
original appointment within sixty (60) days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
(7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a conflict
of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative authority or
top administrative official that appointed the member shall appoint another
individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's place. This
appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and limitations as are
applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
(8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive compensation.
   
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty (60) days after
the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within (60) sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under
division (C) of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to
prepare or waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the
taxpayer may appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney
at law, certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may
allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a
case, the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days after
the first day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety (90) days after the board's final
hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary
mail to all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen (15) days after issuing
the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the
board's final determination as provided in Section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings

of the System, and repaying any advances made or to be made from other funds of
this Village for any of those costs of the System, it is necessary to fix fair,
just and equitable rates to be charged for the use of the System as follows: a
quarterly charge for each property connected to the System equal to the greater
of (i) a minimum charge of fifty dollars ($50.00) or (ii) six dollars and
fifty-six cents ($6.56) per one hundred cubic feet, or any part thereof, of
"metered flow". Any property which would be billed a minimum quarterly charge
of fifty dollars ($50.00) but which has not been connected to the System for
the entire quarter shall have such minimum quarterly charge of fifty dollars
($50.00) prorated based on the number of days such property was connected
during that quarter.
 
   (b)   The term "metered flow" means the record of metered water consumption
for such property maintained by the City of Cleveland Water Department which
provides water service to that property, provided, however, that if, no such
water service is provided to that property then the "metered flow" for such
property shall be determined (i) by the Engineer based on customary engineering
principles and suggested flow guidelines promulgated by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency or (ii) on the basis of a meter of a type approved by the
Engineer for the purpose of measuring such flow to the System and installed and
maintained at the sole expense of the entity responsible for such flow. If the
Engineer, in his professional judgment, determines that the "metered flow" as
described above is not a reasonably accurate measurement of the flow to the
System from a particular property, then the Engineer may require the entity
responsible for such flow to install and maintain, at that entity's sole
expense, a meter for the purpose of measuring such flow, in which case the
measurement of that flow by such meter shall constitute the "metered flow" with
respect to such property. If any such meters are not located in the public
right-of-way, then that entity shall also provide a right of access to the
Village and its agents (including any entity retained by the Village to operate
the System) thereto, in form and substance satisfactory to the Law Director of
this Village.
 
   (c)   The Clerk shall arrange for the billing of those quarterly charges and
any surcharges provided for in Section
933.08 of this Chapter. Any such charges and surcharges not paid within thirty
days of the date of such bill shall have added thereto a penalty equal to ten
percent of such unpaid amount. Any change of ownership or occupancy of the
property shall not be cause for reducing or eliminating the charges, surcharges
or penalties provided for in this Chapter.
 
   (d)   All charges, surcharges and any penalties levied pursuant to this
Chapter are hereby made a lien upon such property charged therewith and if the
same are not paid within ninety days after the same are due and payable, then
they shall be certified to the Auditor of Cuyahoga County who shall place the
same on the tax duplicate, with interest and penalties allowed by law to be
collected as other property taxes are collected. This remedy shall be in
addition to all other remedies provided by law.
 
   (e)   Furthermore, the Village, to the extent permitted by law and in the
event of a failure to pay such charges or surcharges after they become
delinquent, shall have the right to cause water service to be discontinued to
that property, or to remove or close sewer connections to that property; the
expense of such discontinuance, removal or closing, as well as the expense of
restoring service, shall likewise be a debt due to the Village and a lien upon
the property, recoverable by the Village as permitted by law. Water or sewer
service shall not be restored until all charges, surcharges and penalties,
including the expense of removal, closing and restoration, have been paid to
the Village.
 
   (f)   A written application for a refund of charges or surcharges must be
filed with the Clerk of this Village within two years of the date that such
charges or surcharges were paid by the applicant. The application must state in
detail the reason for such claim for a refund and be accompanied by any
documentation supporting such claim. If the Clerk denies the claim in whole or
in part then the applicant may appeal such decision to the Council of the
Village within thirty days of being notified in writing by the Clerk of such
denial.
(Ord. 2002-15. Passed 4-9-02.)
 
   933.08 SURCHARGE FOR FLOWS EXCEEDING NORMAL CONCENTRATIONS.
   (a)   The System has been designed to handle flows with "normal
concentrations" as follows: (i) a five-day, twenty-degree centigrade
biochemical oxygen demand of not more than 200 parts per million; (ii) a
suspended solids content of not more than 250 parts per million; and (iii) an
oil and grease content of not more than 50 parts per million. Flows with
concentrations greater than any one or more of those "normal concentrations"
would have a deleterious effect and impact on the System including, but not
limited to, reducing the hydraulic treatment capacity of the System, increasing
treatment and other operating costs, disrupting the normal treatment process,
and/or causing discharge limits to be exceeded. Therefore, it is fair, just and
equitable to impose a surcharge as follows with respect to flows with
concentrations greater than any one or more of those "normal concentrations".
 
   (b)   If the Engineer determines, based on the exercise of professional
engineering practice, methodology and standards, including measurements, tests
and analyses undertaken by the Engineer in accordance with Section
933.05 of this Chapter, that the flow to the System from a property exceeds any
one or more of those "normal concentrations", then a surcharge, equal to 100%
of the quarterly charge for such property, as measured and determined pursuant
to Section
933.07 of this Chapter, shall be added to the quarterly bill for such property
prepared pursuant to Section
933.07 of this Chapter.
 
   (c)   A surcharge shall continue to be imposed until (i) the entity
responsible for such flow advises the Engineer in writing that it has
implemented pretreatment facilities and controls on, changed the
characteristics of, or otherwise improved, such flow so that such flow no
longer exceeds any one or more of those "normal concentrations", (ii) such
entity has paid, in advance, to this Village, the costs of the Village in
undertaking such measurements, tests and analyses, including the fees and
expenses of the Engineer, and (iii) the Engineer determines, based on the
exercise of professional engineering practice, methodology and standards,
including measurements, tests and analyses undertaken by the Engineer in
accordance with Section
933.05 of this Chapter, that such flow no longer exceeds any one or more of
those "normal concentrations". However, the aforesaid surcharge shall be
reimposed if the Engineer thereafter determines, based on the exercise of
professional engineering practice, methodology and standards, including
measurements, tests and analyses undertaken by the Engineer in accordance with
Section
933.05 of this Chapter, that the flow to the System from such property exceeds
any one or more of those "normal concentrations".
(Ord. 2002-15. Passed 4-9-02.)
 
   933.09 DEPOSIT OF FUNDS COLLECTED.
   All moneys received from the collection of the rates and charges established
herein shall be deposited in the Wastewater Plant Fund. Moneys in such fund
shall be used to pay for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement
expenses of the System, debt services charges on obligations incurred or which
may be incurred for the System, the repayment of any advances made or to be
made by the Village in connection with costs of the System, and any other costs
and expenses related to the System.
(Ord. 2002-15. Passed 4-9-02.)
 
   933.10 ENGINEER.
   As used in this Chapter, the term "Engineer" means the duly appointed
Village Engineer of the Village or a consulting engineer retained by the
Village to provide professional engineering services and advice with respect to
the System and the application of this Chapter.
(Ord. 2002-15. Passed 4-9-02.)
   933.99 PENALTY.

reclaimed the Grave, the purchaser or the purchaser's successor in interest
notifies the Village in writing of that person's desire to retain ownership of
the Grave or to sell the Grave back to the Village, the Village shall pay the
purchaser or purchaser's successor in interest the original amount paid for the
Grave and the Village shall retain all rights and authority to re-convey the

   1131.01  TITLE.
   This Title Three of the Planning and Zoning Code, providing for the
establishment of regulations, rules and standards for subdividing and
developing land within the Village, including procedures for administration and
penalties for the violation thereof, shall be known, cited and referred to as
the "Subdivision and Land Development Regulations" of the Village of Gates
Mills, Ohio, and shall be referred to herein as "these Regulations".
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1131.02 STATEMENT OF FINDINGS.
   (a)   The Planning and Zoning Commission of Gates Mills and the Council each
find that the Village contains lands which have unique scenic, residential,
recreational and scientific value, which qualities benefit not only the
residents of the Village but also residents of Cuyahoga, Lake and Geauga
counties.
   (b)   The Commission and the Council each also find that a significant
portion of the lands in the Village are comprised of exceedingly steep slopes,
are located in flood plains, contain soils which are unsuitable for septic
systems, and lack a dependable supply of well water.
 
   (c)   The Commission and the Council each find it necessary to regulate the
subdivision of land and the splitting of lots in order to preserve and protect
not only the public interest in the preservation of natural beauty and terrain
but, even more importantly, to protect the public health and safety by
preventing the erosion of soils, the contamination of water supplies, the
increased runoff of surface water and the increased risk of flood damage.
   (d)   The Commission and the Council each find that in order to benefit the
ultimate purchasers of lots in the Village who thereby become future residents
and taxpayers hereof, developers of subdivisions should provide evidence that
each newly created lot in such subdivision contains at least one suitable
building site with reasonable access, a reasonable grade, an available supply
of water and an adequate field for the placement of a properly designed septic
system, and is designed in a way so as to minimize the amount of surface water
runoff from the lot so as to prevent soil erosion and flooding.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1131.03  PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   The general purpose of these Regulations shall be to guide and
regulate the subdivision and development of land in order to promote and
protect the public health, safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general
welfare. It is intended that the provisions of these Regulations shall be
applied to achieve the following objectives:
      (1)   Protection of the public health and safety by preventing the
contamination of water supplies, the erosion of soils, the excessive runoff of
surface water and the increased risk of flood damage.
      (2)   Safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian circulation as well as
safe and convenient access and circulation, for police, fire and medical
vehicles.
      (3)   Protection of the scenic values and the scenic resources of the
Village, particularly the natural beauty and terrain of the Village, the
foremost of which is the Chagrin River Valley, together with the preservation
of biological and ecological diversity.
      (4)   Preservation of open space for the general welfare of the residents
of the Village, including recreational, environmental and other purposes.
      (5)   Orderly development of the land.
   (b)   These Regulations shall also provide that each newly created lot meets
not only the applicable minimum size requirement contained in the Zoning Code
and the Zoning Map of the Village, but also contains at least one suitable
building site which conforms to the setback requirements of the Zoning Code and
which has reasonable access, a reasonable grade, an available supply of water
and an adequate area for the placement of a properly designed septic system,
and is designed in a way as to minimize the amount of surface water runoff from
the lot so as to prevent soil erosion and flooding.
   (c)   These Regulations shall also ensure the accurate surveying of land and
the proper preparation and recording of plats.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1131.04  INTERPRETATION; AUTHORITY.
   These Regulations shall be considered minimum requirements for the
protection of the public health, safety, comfort, property and general welfare,
pursuant to the authority of the Constitution of the State of Ohio, the Charter
of the Village and the platting and land subdivision statutes contained in Ohio
R.C. Chapter 711, or such statutes as may hereinafter be in effect.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1131.05 AMENDMENTS.
   Amendments to these Regulations may be initiated by either the Planning and
Zoning Commission or by Council. The Commission shall hold a public hearing on
all proposed amendments, whether initiated by the Commission or referred to the
Commission by the Council. The Commission shall promptly, after such hearing,
make a report to Council on the proposed amendment, which report shall
summarize the results of the public hearing and the effect of the amendment,
especially as it relates to the findings and objectives set forth in Sections
1131.02 and
1131.03, and shall contain the recommendation of the Commission as to whether
or not such amendment should be approved by Council. The Council shall consider
such report and may pass any ordinance providing for such amendment only upon
the affirmative vote of at least five members of Council.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1131.06  SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of these Regulations
is for any reason held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
decision shall not affect the remaining portions of these Regulations.

   1133.01 VARIANCES.
   Where the Commission finds that the land involved in a subdivision is of
such size or shape, or is subject to such title limitations, or is affected by
such topographical conditions, or is to be devoted to such usage, that it is
impossible or impracticable in the particular proposal for the developer to
fully conform to the mandatory provisions of these Regulations, the Commission
may grant a variance from such mandatory provisions as may be reasonable,
provided, however, that no such variance shall be granted which impairs the
purpose and objectives of these Regulations as set forth in Section
1131.03, and provided, further, that no action shall be taken by the Commission
until it shall cause notice of the proposed variance to be sent by registered
mail, return receipt requested, to all abutting, adjoining property owners and
others considered by the Commission to be affected property owners, and a
reasonable time, not less than ten days, shall be allowed for a reply from the
property owners before action is taken by the Commission. Such notice shall be
sent by to the address of such property owner(s) appearing on the County
Auditor's current tax list or the Village Treasurer's current mailing list. The
failure of delivery of such notice shall not invalidate the action of the
Commission. However, if, due to inadvertence, a property owner to whom notice
should have been sent has not been notified and such property owner protests
the Commission action, the Commission may reconsider and reverse its prior
action provided that the applicant is not prejudiced by the Commission's
action.
(Ord. 2433. Passed 6-11-91.)
   1133.02  APPEALS.
   A developer aggrieved by any final action of the Council in regard to
refusal to approve a subdivision may appeal such decision pursuant to Ohio R.C.
Chapter 2506. (Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1133.03  SCHEDULE OF FEES AND DEPOSITS. 
   (a)   Plat and Lot Split. At the time of filing the application for approval
of any plat, lot split, lot consolidation or boundary line adjustment, there
shall be paid to the Treasurer a filing fee in the amount of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) for a lot split, lot consolidation or boundary line
adjustment, and three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00) for a subdivision. At
such time there shall also be deposited with the Treasurer and thereafter
maintained on deposit the amount of two thousand, five hundred dollars ($2,500)
for a subdivision and seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) for a lot split,
lot consolidation or boundary line adjustment, which sums shall ensure the
payment by the applicant of all expenses incurred by the Village in the
processing of the application and of all pertinent papers connected therewith.
   The cost and expense of any investigation which may be necessary by the
Village Engineer, the Director of Law and other Village officials, to determine
whether or not such proposed subdivision or lot split, lot consolidation or
boundary line adjustment, is in accordance with law, and to determine whether
or not its improvements, if any, have been made or are being made in accordance
with the requirements of the Village, the cost of any and all notices required,
and all other expenses, shall be paid by the developer.
   The actual expenditures shall be paid by the applicant upon demand of the
Treasurer. The unexpended balance of the deposit shall be refunded to the
applicant upon the completion of all administrative proceedings involved in
connection therewith. No filing fee shall be refunded or returned. No building
permits shall be issued until all amounts required to be paid by the applicant
have been paid.
(Ord. 2863. Passed 9-9-97.)
   (b)   Recording Expenses. Any person, firm or corporation desiring to
improve or develop land in the Village shall prepare, execute and deliver to
the Building Official the instruments necessary to carry out the improvements
as required by the rules, regulations and ordinances of the Village at the cost
and expense of the developer. At the time the application for the approval of
such improvements is requested, the applicant shall also deposit funds to pay
the cost and expense of recording the documents necessary for such improvements
based on the recording fees established by the County Recorder from time to
time. The funds collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the
General Fund of the Village.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1133.04  LAND TRANSFER BEFORE RECORDING; PENALTIES.
   (a)   Whoever, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land located
within the jurisdiction of these Regulations, willfully transfers any lot or
parcel of such land in accordance with any plat of a subdivision before such
plat has been recorded, shall forfeit and pay a sum not less than one hundred
dollars ($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each lot or
parcel of land sold. The description of such lot or parcel by metes and bounds
in the deed of transfer shall not serve to exempt the seller from the
forfeiture herein provided for. The Village may enjoin such sale or agreement
by a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction.
 
   (b)   The sale of lots or parcels from a plat of a subdivision on which any
and all areas indicated as streets or as open ground are expressly indicated as
for the exclusive use of the abutting or other owners in such subdivision and
not as public streets, ways or grounds, shall not serve to exempt the seller
from the requirements of these Regulations or from the forfeiture herein
provided for.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1133.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of these
Regulations, for which no penalty is otherwise provided, or fails to comply
with any order issued pursuant thereto, shall be fined not less than ten
dollars ($10.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000).

   1135.01  PRE-APPLICATION.
   The Village shall make available to developers copies of these Regulations,
the Zoning Code, the Zoning Map and other adopted plans, street maps and
information which may affect the development of the property under
consideration. Applications for approval of a subdivision shall be in
accordance with these Regulations and other codes and plans as adopted and
information furnished.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1135.02 TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Plans, profiles, maps, data and plats shall be prepared and furnished by the
developer and meet the technical requirements set forth herein in order to
assure accurate surveying, and to provide adequate information for designing,
preparing, reviewing and approving preliminary plans and for reviewing,
approving and recording final plats. (Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1135.03 PRELIMINARY PLAN.
   (a)   Application for Approval. A written application for approval and ten
black-on-white prints of a preliminary plan and profiles of all streets,
plotted on a topographic map complying with the technical requirements set
forth in Section
1135.04  and the design standards established in Chapter
1137 , shall be submitted to the Building Official for each proposed
subdivision. The purposes of the preliminary plan are to explore the best
design for the subdivision and the best relationship to adjoining subdivisions
or undeveloped land, to outline a program of improvements, to ensure that an
adequate water supply and an adequate septic system could potentially be
available to each lot and that extensive and environmentally harmful grading
operations will not be required, and to obtain the advice, suggestions and
requirements of the Commission before the plan becomes rigid as in a detailed
drawing. The submittal of alternative plans is recommended.
   (b)   Referral to Village Engineer.
      (1)   The Building Official shall forward one print of the preliminary
plan and profiles to the Village Engineer who will check the same against all
requirements provided for in these Regulations and all other ordinances of the
Village. The Village Engineer shall, within six weeks, except as provided in
paragraph (b)(2) hereof, return the print to the Building Official together
with his or her comments and recommendations.
      (2)   For all subdivisions which are of such scope or at such locations
as, in the opinion of the Village Engineer, may involve topographic problems,
unstable soil conditions, unique ecological and environmental concerns, or
other unusual conditions, the Village Engineer shall so advise the Commission
which thereupon may request that Council authorize obtaining an analysis and
recommendation from a professional land planner, civil engineer or landscape
architect who is experienced in planning the type of subdivision under
consideration, who is recommended by the Village Engineer and who has no
interest in the proposed subdivision. If Council approves the request, the
Village Engineer shall, within two weeks of the receipt of such analysis and
recommendations from such professional, return the print to the Building
Official together with his or her comments and recommendations and the analysis
and recommendations from such professional.
   (c)   Commission Action.
      (1)   After the Building Official receives the report of the Village
Engineer on the preliminary plan, and any comments and recommendations
concerning the plan which the Village Engineer or any professional may make,
the Building Official shall set a date for a hearing on such plan and shall
mail a copy of the notice of such hearing to the developer by first class mail,
and to the list of property owners provided by the developer under Section
1135.04 at least two weeks before the hearing date, and shall also give public
notice by posting a copy of such notice in the places identified in Section
 1135.04 of these Codified Ordinances not less than two weeks nor more than
four weeks before the meeting of that hearing date so that all interested
parties may attend the meeting.
      (2)   If the Commission finds the proposal meets the requirements
hereunder under the circumstances and acts favorably, the Secretary of the
Commission shall affix his or her signature to two copies of the preliminary
plan and profiles with a notation that the same has received approval, along
with any special conditions. The Secretary shall then deliver one of the copies
to the Clerk of Council and retain the other copy.
   (d)   Council Action.
      (1)   If the vote of the Commission is to approve the preliminary plan
and profiles, the Secretary shall deliver the plan and profiles to Council with
a written report of the Commission's action. If the vote of the Commission is
to disapprove the preliminary plan and profiles, its action is final unless
within thirty days thereof the developer elects to appeal such action to
Council.
      (2)   If the vote of the Commission is to approve the preliminary plan
and profiles, the Council shall by record vote approve or disapprove the
preliminary plan and profiles by a majority vote of all members of Council. If
the vote of the Commission is to disapprove the preliminary plan and profiles,
the Council can approve the preliminary plan and profiles only by the
affirmative vote of five members of Council. All actions by both the Commission
and Council shall be made a matter of their minutes of that meeting.
   (e)   Effect of Approval. The approval of the preliminary plan by Council
shall assure the developer, for a one-year period from the date of approval by
Council, that:
      (1)   The general layout of streets, lots, building sites and other
features is approved and has been established as the basis for the preparation
of the final plat.
      (2)   The general terms and any special conditions under which the
approval of the plan was granted will not be changed unless additional
information or data are received in the meantime that would indicate that
changes should be effected.
      (3)   The developer may submit drawings and specifications for
improvements and a final plat for the subdivision.

or rerecorded by the Village Engineer in the office of the County Recorder. In
addition thereto, the developer shall, in any deed or purchase agreement
relating to the subdivision as a whole or to individual lots therein, include
the following provision:
"The undersigned grantees of a building lot or parcel of land described as
follows: (insert legal description), which is subject to the terms and
provisions of the Declaration of Restrictions and Easements of
                      Subdivision duly executed and filed for record by the

hereby acknowledge that (name of street(s)) within the    Subdivision is (are)
(a) private roads and not (a) dedicated public thoroughfare(s); that the
                        Subdivision Home Owners Association and/or the owners
of the sublots on (name of street(s)) shall pay all costs of maintaining,

or for a longer period as may be mutually agreed, to allow the Village time to
acquire such land. During such period, no structure shall be erected, no trees
or topsoil shall be removed or destroyed and no grading shall be done on such
land, and no land so reserved shall be put to any use whatsoever, except with
the written approval of the Commission.
 
   (c)   Other Developments. An application and preliminary plan shall be
submitted by the developer to the Commission for all proposals for other
developments or subdivisions involving open spaces for common use. All
procedures, maps, plans, profiles and other data required by Section
1135.06  shall be complied with and furnished if determined applicable by the
Commission. Where streets or other areas are to be used by the public, all
procedures, maps and other data required by Section
1135.06  shall be complied with and furnished if determined applicable by the
Commission.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1135.08  VILLAGE ENGINEER TO HAVE CUSTODY OF FINAL PLATS; FILING, INDEXING
AND INSPECTION.
   The Village Engineer shall be the custodian of all final plats for all the
plotted lands in the Village, subject to the rules and regulations promulgated
by Council. Such plats shall be maintained on file and be properly indexed and
available for inspection by the public. (Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1135.09 RESUBDIVIDING, REPLATTING OR VACATION.
   An application for resubdividing, replatting or vacation of a subdivision
shall be made by the owner or owners thereof to the Commission in the same form
as for an original subdivision along with all required maps and other
information. The original lots shall be shown by dotted lines, lot numbers and
other references to the previously recorded subdivision.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1135.10 LOT SPLITS; MISCELLANEOUS PLAT APPROVAL; NO PLAT REQUIRED.
   (a)   Notwithstanding the provisions set forth above, a proposed division of
a parcel of land, which does not constitute a subdivision as defined in Section
1131.07 (also known as a lot split), may be submitted to the Commission without
a plat to be recorded.
 
   (b)   The owner shall submit a plat map showing the division of such land in
graphic dimensional form. This map shall be certified by a registered surveyor
as to its correctness and shall contain information as is pertinent to its
determination hereunder. In addition, the owner at the time of such submission
shall also furnish evidence that such proposed division has been approved by
any County, State or Federal agencies which are required by law to approve such
proposed division and shall also furnish evidence of suitability for
development of each lot pursuant to the provisions of Section
1137.04, which provisions are hereby made specifically applicable to a lot
split.
   (c)   The Commission may recommend that Council approve the proposed
conveyance if it is satisfied that such division is not contrary to these
Regulations or the Zoning Code, or any rule or regulation which the Commission
has adopted for the processing of such divisions or the conduct of its
business.
 
   (d)   When the Council is satisfied that the information submitted is
sufficient for its determination, it shall decide upon such plat. Evidence of
approval by the Council will be indicated by a stamp or statement reading:
"Approved by the Council, Village of Gates Mills, Ohio - No Plat Required". The
plat map of the division which has been thus stamped, dated and signed by both
the Clerk of Council and the Village Engineer shall constitute approval under
this section.
   (e)   The owner shall produce written proof that such conveyance has been
submitted for recording in the office of the County Recorder within sixty days
of such approval; otherwise, the approval provided for herein shall be null and
void.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1135.11 ADJUSTMENTS TO LOT BOUNDARY LINE.
   No property owner shall record or cause to be recorded any instrument
effectuating an adjustment to a lot boundary within the Village with the
Cuyahoga County Recorder without first applying for and receiving approval for
the lot boundary adjustment as set forth in this section. Whenever the Building
Official receives a request by a property owner for an adjustment to a lot
boundary, which adjustment is not of the type which would require review and
approval by the Commission and Council as a subdivision or lot split as set
forth in these Regulations, the Building Official shall immediately notify the
Commission and the Village Engineer of the proposed boundary line adjustment.
The Village Engineer shall review the proposed boundary line adjustment for
compliance with this Zoning Code and shall report his findings to the Planning
Commission. The Commission shall examine the proposed boundary line adjustment
application and, prior to approval, may request the applicant to furnish
evidence of suitability for development of each resulting lot pursuant to the
provisions of Section
1137.04, which provisions are hereby made specifically applicable to boundary
line adjustments. If the Commission is satisfied that the proposed boundary
line adjustment has been appropriately reviewed by the Village Engineer and
meets the other requirements of its review, it shall approve the boundary line
adjustment and authorize the Village Engineer to approve the application for
recording with the Cuyahoga County Recorder."

   1137.01  TOPOGRAPHY.
   Subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the topography of the
land in order to utilize the natural contours and economize in the construction
of drainage facilities, reduce the amount of grading and minimize destruction
of trees and topsoil. Topographic maps shall be utilized in this land planning.
   (a)   Streets and Topography. Land which is relatively flat or of very
gentle slopes should be planned so that the streets follow the natural drainage
courses and as many lots as possible shall be above the street grade. On more
irregular topography, streets should be designed to avoid extensive cuts and
fills.
   (b)   Natural Drainage. Subdivisions should be designed, particularly on
land of very gentle slopes, to take every advantage of natural grades so that
all the land can be drained without excessive grading. Unless watercourses or
drainage ways are enclosed, the plan shall be adjusted so that rear lot lines
are approximately parallel to the natural or straightened course, and only
where such a plan is not possible may side lot lines be arranged parallel to an
open drainage course.
   (c)   Natural Features. Natural features, irregularities, changes in level,
brooks, lakes, hilltops and other focal points within the site, and distant
views outside the subdivision, shall be integrated in the design to obtain
natural variations and interest and more attractive building sites. Trees,
topsoil and other natural resources shall be preserved and utilized in the
planning and development of the subdivision.
      (Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1137.02 STREET PLANNING.
   In addition to relating streets to topography as recommended in Section
1137.01, streets should be designed according to the function served, the use
of abutting land and standards of width, intersections, maximum grades and
curvatures, as set forth in the following subsections.
   (a)   Major streets function primarily for the movement of fast traffic
between points of heavy traffic generation. Where a subdivision adjoins a major
street, the Commission shall require a plan wherein access drives do not cut
onto a major street in order to protect the residential property from the
movement of heavy traffic, to avoid traffic congestion and to minimize hazards
to traffic. Such a plan shall provide for access drives to cut only onto a
local street or streets.
   (b)   Local streets shall allow for access to each lot. The layout shall be
related to the topography and natural features. The street pattern should be
indirect and yet continuous and formed of straight, moderately curved, loop,
angular or ell streets. There shall be an underlying systematic pattern, but
gridiron and other rigid geometrical patterns shall be avoided. The street
pattern shall limit the number of local streets intersecting with a major
street in order to protect the residential property from the movement of heavy
traffic and to minimize hazards to the traffic on the major street.
   (c)   All streets shall be designed to allow for safe and convenient access
and circulation of police, fire and medical vehicles.
   (d)   Right-of-way widths for all streets shall not be less than sixty feet.
   (e)   Intersecting streets shall be provided so that no block shall be
longer than 2400 feet. "Dead-end" streets shall terminate at a turning circle
having an outside diameter of not less than 150 feet. All intersections at side
lines of streets shall be provided with a turnout which has a radius of not
less than thirty feet.
   (f)   Grades of streets in vertical alignment shall not exceed ten percent.
Grades of streets which are curved or provide access in only one direction
shall not exceed eight percent. Street grades shall be not less than one
percent in order to provide adequate surface drainage. The rate of change of
grade shall not exceed four percent per 100 feet of length.
   (g)   Street names shall be selected which will not duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets within the zip code area of the Village
irrespective of modifying terms such as street, avenue, boulevard, etc. Streets
that are or will eventually be continuations of existing or platted streets
shall be named the same as such streets. Street names shall be subject to the
approval of the Commission.
      (Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1137.03 LOT DESIGN.
   Each lot should form a good site for the type of building to be developed
and the lot lines should not be considered as merely forming a geometric shape
which encloses the area permitted. The layout of the lots should be related to
the topography and natural features and in an irregular form as long as such
layout and form allow for a building site in conformity with the setback
requirements of the Zoning Code. Triangular lots or those with acute angles,
broken boundaries or other shapes that restrict the use of the lot as a
building site should be avoided.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1137.04  EVIDENCE OF SUITABILITY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A LOT.
   At the time of submitting an application for approval of a preliminary plan
under Section
1135.03, the developer shall furnish satisfactory evidence that each lot to be
created pursuant to such plan, as of the date of the submission of such
application:
   (a)   Has a supply of water available from:
      (1)   A public water line which borders one of the boundaries of the
proposed subdivision;
      (2)   An individual water well which will produce safe potable drinking
water at a rate conforming to the requirements of the Cuyahoga County Board of
Health; or
      (3)   Any other alternative system, including, but not limited to a
community water supply system, conforming to the requirements of the Cuyahoga
County Board of Health and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
      Copies of well logs which are obtained shall include the name and address
of the well driller and shall be submitted to the Commission.
   (b)   Has available, based on the criteria of suitability of the soil
characteristics, surface drainage, topography and character of development, an
area for the installation of an individual septic tank disposal system, which
is feasible, conforms to the requirements of the Village, the Cuyahoga County
Board of Health and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, does not empty in
any manner into open ditches, roadside ditches, lakes, streams or any other
body of water, and does not permit effluent to seep to the surface of the
ground. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to obtain or perform
all tests in accordance with the requirements of the aforesaid public bodies. A
copy of the results of such tests shall be submitted to the Commission.
   (c)   Has at least one suitable building site for a main building and at
least one accessory building, such as a garage, which building site meets the
setback requirements of the Zoning Code and which building site may be cleared
and prepared for building with a minimal amount of disturbance to the natural
grade, trees and vegetation. Such building site shall be indicated on the map
of each lot.
   (d)   Has a suitable site for an access drive to serve the lot site, which
will be situated in such a way that it shall be of no more than a ten percent
grade, shall follow the natural contours of the land as closely as possible and
shall minimize the amount of disturbance to the natural grade, trees and
vegetation.
   (e)   Has an adequate system of drainage so that significant erosion does
not occur and so that the stormwater runoff is channeled in such a way as to
minimize the erosion of other property and to prevent the accumulation of
standing water on the lot or on any other property in the Village.
   (f)   Has a significant amount of property which will be left in its natural
state and also a map indicating:
      (1)   Generally the location of groves of trees on the lot, and
      (2)   Individual trees on the proposed building site under subsection (c)
hereof which are over nine inches in diameter, which of such trees or groves of
trees or portions thereof will be removed in order to allow for the
improvements set forth in subsections (a) through (e) hereof, and any plan for
replanting of trees removed and the reseeding of any grounds disturbed.

(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1139.04 DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by the developer for the
proper drainage of the surface water of the subdivision and each lot as
follows:
   (a)   An enclosed storm sewer system shall be provided where it is
determined by the Commission, based on the advice of the Village Engineer, that
storm sewers should be provided and connected to a drainage ditch or other
water way in order to prevent erosion of soils and flooding. The system shall
have a capacity to serve the subdivision and drainage area of which it is a
part. The system shall include pipes, culverts, manholes, catch basins, drain
inlets and a connection for each lot.
   (b)   The developer may be required to deed in fee, dedicate or grant an
easement to the Village for a drainage channel not less in width than that
which is required by a plan or standards adopted by the Village, or by the
existing topography along the watercourse. The developer may rechannel any
watercourse through his or her property in order to contain the storm drain
flow within a lesser width. The developer shall be responsible for clearing the
drainage way of all debris as a condition of acceptance.
   (c)   The drainage system shall be designed in accordance with standards of
the Village. The developer shall construct and pay for all storm sewers.
      (Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1139.05  ELECTRIC, GAS, TELEPHONE AND WATER UTILITIES.

Hereafter, in every subdivision within the Village, all communication, electric
power and street lighting wires, conduits or cables to serve the lots within
such subdivision shall be constructed underground and upon easements provided
for such utilities pursuant to Section
1139.02 . Wires, conduits or cables owned by or serving individual owners and
located wholly on such an owner's property need not be located upon easements.
The developer or lot owners within the subdivision shall bear any increase in
cost over the normal mode of construction of communication or electric lines
and facilities, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the telephone
or electric company involved.
   (d)   Installation or Bond Required. Prior to the granting of final

thereof, in and through the Village, without first obtaining a permit therefor
from Council. The applicant for such permit shall first file with Council
detailed plans and specifications in support of the request for such permit.
 
   (f)   Construction Standards. All extensions of electric power and street
lighting wires, conduits or cables, including equipment, housings and
transformers necessary in the operation of distribution or service systems,
shall be constructed underground in accordance with the standards and
regulations of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, with provision for
street lighting lamps. Bases must be provided for the ultimate installation of
street lights, spaced no farther apart than every fourth lot. Until used, the
wiring in such bases shall be safely insulated and de- energized.
 
   (g)   Variances. The Commission may authorize a variance from the provisions
of this section when undue hardship may result from strict compliance. In
granting any variance, the Commission shall prescribe only conditions that it
deems necessary or desirable to protect the public interest. The Commission
shall grant such a variance only when it finds that there are special
circumstances or conditions affecting the property such that the strict
application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of
the reasonable use of his or her land.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1139.07  STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Pavements. The developer shall design and construct on each local
street a pavement with a width of eighteen feet comprised of asphalt and in
accordance with general plans and profiles for Standard Curbless Pavement With
Roadside Ditches utilized by the Village Engineer and presently on file with
the Building Official. The Commission may require higher standards and/or
greater widths than those set forth above, because of extraordinary traffic
loads or unusual soil conditions in specific locations.
   (b)    Access Drives. An access drive shall be not more than sixteen feet
wide. The flare for driveways shall be at least three feet wider than the
pavement on each side, the grade of the apron shall not exceed five percent for
a distance of twenty feet from the edge of the street pavement, and the maximum
grade of the access drive shall not exceed ten percent.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9- 89; Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1139.08 MONUMENTS.
   A monument shall be accurately placed at each corner and at changes in
direction of the boundary, at each street intersection, at points of curves of
streets and at intermediate points as may be required by the Village Engineer.
The monuments shall be concrete six by six by thirty inches long, with an iron
pin in the center, or metal monuments as approved by the Engineer. The top of
the monument or monument box shall be set at the finished grade upon the
completion of the grading or paving of the streets and the lots. (Ord. 2362.
Passed 10-9-89.)
   1139.09 STREET NAME SIGNS.
   Street name signs shall be furnished and installed by the owner of the
subdivision if a new street is planned. The design of such signs and the
installation thereof shall be in conformity with existing street name signs in
the Village, provided, however, that if the dedication of such street is not
accepted by Council pursuant to Section
1135.07(a), such sign shall also include the words "Private Drive" underneath
the name of the street. (Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1139.10  EXTENSION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   If streets or electric, gas or telephone utilities are not available at the
boundary of a proposed subdivision, the Village may require, as a condition
precedent to approval of a preliminary plan and final plat, assurances that
such improvement extensions shall be provided. If the Commission finds that the
extension of streets across undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a
special assessment to the intervening properties, the developer may be
required, if he or she wishes to proceed with the development, to obtain
necessary easements or rights of way and construct and pay for extensions.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1139.11  DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF DRAINAGE SYSTEMS AND ROADWAYS;
INSPECTIONS; RECORD TRACINGS OF UNDERGROUND UTILITIES.
   The design of the drainage systems and roadways shall be in accordance with
the various standards and requirements described in Sections
1139.04 and
1139.07. Drawings and specifications for the improvements shall be reviewed and
approved by the Village Engineer, and the installation shall be subject to his
or her continuous inspection. At the completion of the construction and before
acceptance, the developer shall furnish the Village a set of record tracings
showing the locations, sizes and elevations of all underground utilities. (Ord.
2362. Passed 10-9- 89.)
   1139.12 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE IN LIEU OF INSTALLATION.
   (a)    Types of Guarantees. If the developer undertakes improvements before
applying for approval of the final plat he or she shall provide suitable rights
of access to the Village and financial guarantees as set forth herein. In lieu
of actual installation or completion, the developer may execute and file with
the Village financial guarantees of the required improvements concurrently with
the application for approval of the final plat. All such guarantees may be in
the form of a performance or surety bond, a certified check, or any other type
of surety approved as to form by the Director of Law and accepted by the
Village.
 
   (b)    Terms of Guarantees. The terms of all such guarantees shall be
determined by the Commission, provided, however, they shall not be for a longer
period than eighteen months unless Council, by resolution, extends the time.
Bonds shall be executed by the applicant as principal with a surety company
authorized to do business in the State and shall be in a form satisfactory to
the Director of Law.
 
   (c)    Amounts of Guarantees. The financial guarantees shall be in an amount
equal to the estimated total cost of materials, labor and engineering required
to install or construct the improvements, plus ten percent for contingencies.
Such costs shall be determined by the Village Engineer. When any portion of an
improvement has, upon inspection, been found satisfactorily completed, a
reduction in the bonds or partial withdrawal of funds equal to the estimated
costs of such completed improvements may be authorized. (Ord. 2362. Passed 10-
9-89.)
   1139.13  STREET MAINTENANCE; GUARANTEE.
   The developer shall guarantee the construction and material of the street
improvements, shall maintain the street improvements for a period of two years
from their date of completion and shall post a maintenance bond running in
favor of the Village, if the Village accepts the dedication of such street
improvements, or to the appropriate homeowner's association if the Village does
not accept the dedication of such street improvements, in a form approved by
the Director of Law. In any event, the maintenance bond shall be in the amount
of twenty percent of the financial guarantees required by Section
1139.12 for the improvements.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1139.14  INSURANCE.
   The developer shall agree to indemnify and save harmless the Village against
and from any and all loss, cost, damage, liability and expense on account of
damage to property of, or injury to or death of, any person, caused by, growing
out of, or in any way whatsoever attributable to, the construction of the
improvements and the use of the street delineated on the subdivision plat
during the construction. The developer shall further agree, but without
limiting his or her liability, to indemnify the Village by carrying
comprehensive general liability insurance contracts with a reliable insurance
company, covering the period of construction, in the sum of three million
dollars ($3,000,000) all-occurrence coverage, which insurance contracts shall
include the Village as a named insured. The developer shall agree to maintain
on file with the Village during the period of construction, certificates or
memoranda of insurance evidencing that such insurance contracts are in force.
(Ord. 2362. Passed 10-9-89.)
   1139.15  FAILURE TO COMPLETE IMPROVEMENTS; REMEDY BY VILLAGE.
   If the developer fails to complete the installation of all land improvements
according to the terms and conditions of the agreement, the Village, upon
proper notice, may complete the same and appropriate a portion of money or
bonds posted for the faithful performance of such work, such that the Village
is completely reimbursed for all expenses incurred by it in connection with
such work.

   1151.01 INTERPRETATION; LOT OR YARD AREAS; CONFLICTS.
   (a)    In interpreting and applying the provisions of this Zoning Code, they
shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the
public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. The lot or
yard areas required by this Zoning Code for a particular structure shall not be
diminished and shall not be included as a part of the required lot or yard
areas of any other structure. The lot or yard areas of structures existing at
the time of the passage of this Zoning Code shall not be diminished below the
requirements herein provided for structures hereafter erected, and such
requirements as to areas shall not be included as a part of the required areas
of any structure hereafter erected.
   (b)    This Zoning Code shall not repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way
interfere with any existing provisions of law or ordinance or any rules or
regulations previously adopted or issued or which shall be adopted or issued
pursuant to law relating to the use of structures or premises, nor shall this
Zoning Code interfere with, abrogate or annul any easements, covenants or other
agreements between parties. However, where this Zoning Code imposes a greater
restriction upon the use of structures, or premises or upon the height of
structures, or requires larger yards than are imposed or required by such
existing provisions of law or ordinance or by such rules or regulations or by
such easements, covenants or other agreements, the provisions of this Zoning
Code shall control. (Ord. 2248. Passed 12-5-87.)
   1151.02 COMPLETION AND RESTORATION OF EXISTING BUILDINGS.
   Nothing contained in this Zoning Code shall require any change in the plans,
construction or designated use of a building for which a building permit has
been heretofore issued and the construction of which shall have been diligently
prosecuted within fifty days of the date of such permit, and the ground story
framework of which, including the second tier of beams, shall have been
completed within six months of the date of such permit, and which entire
building shall be completed according to such plans, as filed, within two years
from the date of the passage of this Zoning Code. Nothing in this Zoning Code
shall prevent the restoration of a building wholly or partly destroyed by fire,
explosion, act of God or act of the public enemy, subsequent to the passage of
this Zoning Code, or prevent a change of such existing use under the
limitations provided in Section
1157.08. Nothing in this Zoning Code shall prevent the restoration of a wall
declared to be unsafe by the Building Official.
(Ord. 450. Passed 6-13-38; Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1151.03 AMENDMENTS.
   Council may, from time to time, upon its own motion or upon petition, after
public notice and hearing, amend the regulations and districts herein
established. Every such proposed amendment shall be referred by Council to the
Planning and Zoning Commission for report. Any such amendment that has failed
to receive the approval of the Commission shall not be passed by Council except
by a three-fourths vote. If a protest against such amendment is presented duly
signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty percent of the land within such
area proposed to be altered, such amendment shall not be passed except by a
three-fourths vote of Council. If such amendment will transfer an area to a
less restricted use, height or area district, and a protest is presented duly
signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty percent of the land adjacent to
and within 200 feet from such area proposed to be transferred, and within a
more restricted use, height or area district than the district in which such
area is proposed to be transferred, such amendment shall not be passed except
by a three-fourths vote of Council.
   Whenever the owners of fifty percent of the land in any area shall present a
duly signed and acknowledged petition to Council, requesting an amendment of
the regulations prescribed for such area, it shall be the duty of Council to
vote upon such amendment within ninety days after the filing of the same by the
petitioners with the Clerk.
   If any area is hereafter transferred to another district by a change in the
district boundaries by amendment as provided in this section, the provisions of
this Zoning Code with regard to buildings or premises existing at the time of
the passage of this Zoning Code shall apply to buildings or premises existing
in such transferred areas at the time of the passage of such amendment.
(Ord. 450. Passed 6-13-38.)
   1151.04  SEPARABILITY.
   The sections, subsections, districts and building lines forming part of or
established by this Zoning Code and the several parts, provisions and
regulations thereof are hereby declared to be independent sections,
subsections, districts, building lines, parts, provisions and regulations, and
the holding of any such section, subsection, district, building line, part,
provision or regulation to be unconstitutional, void or ineffective for any
class shall not affect or render invalid any other such section, subsection,
district, building line, part, provision or regulation of this Zoning Code.

the nature of the subsoil condition, and where the topography of the land does
not permit proper drainage for basement footing drains.

ground floor containing not less than 200 square feet in addition to the ground

   1153.01 ENFORCEMENT; BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   (a)   This Zoning Code shall be enforced by the Building Inspector under the
rules and regulations of the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Planning and Zoning
Commission is hereby constituted a Board of Zoning Appeals for the purpose of
this Zoning Code.
 
   (b)   All meetings of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be public. The Board
shall keep minutes of its proceedings, show the vote of each member upon every
question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicate such fact. The Board shall
adopt from time to time such rules and regulations as it may deem necessary to
carry into effect the provisions of this Zoning Code. Any decision of the
Building Official made in the enforcement of this Zoning Code may be appealed
to the Board by any person claiming to be adversely affected by such decision.
(Ord. 2433. Passed 6-11-91; Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1153.02  APPEALS; NOTICE.
   Upon receipt of an appeal, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall send notice by
registered mail, return receipt requested, of the filing thereof to all
abutting and adjoining property owners and others considered by the Board to be
affected by the appeal. A reasonable time, not less than ten days, shall be
allowed for a reply from the property owners before action is taken by the
Board. Such notice shall be sent to the address of the property owner(s)
appearing on the County Auditor's current tax list or the Village Treasurer's
current mailing list. The failure of delivery of such notice shall not
invalidate the action of the Board. However, if, due to inadvertence, a
property owner to whom notice should have been sent is not notified, such
property owner may protest the Board's action and the Board may reconsider and
revoke its prior action if the applicant is not prejudiced by the Board's
action.
(Ord. 2433. Passed 6-11-91.)
   1153.03 VARIANCES.
   Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way
of carrying out the strict letter of the provisions of this Zoning Code, the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to vary in a specific case any
such provision in harmony with its general purpose and intent so that the
public health, safety and general welfare may be secured and substantial
justice done. In addition, an application for an area variance need not
establish unnecessary hardship, but must show practical difficulties. The
factors to be considered and weighed by the Board in determining whether a
property owner seeking an area variance has encountered practical difficulties
in the use of his or her property include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return or whether
there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (2)   Whether the variance is substantial;
      (3)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a substantial detriment as
a result of the variance;
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services;
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction;
      (6)   Whether the property owner's predicament can be obviated through
some method other than a variance;
      (7)   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
         (Ord. 2433. Passed 6-11-91.)
   1153.031 TIME LIMITATION FOR CONSTRUCTION IN CONNECTION WITH VARIANCES.
   Failure of an applicant to commence substantial construction or action with
regard to a variance approval within eighteen months of receiving approval of
the variance and to complete such construction or action within thirty-six
months of receiving approval of the variance shall automatically render the
granting of the variance by the Board of Zoning Appeals null and void.
(Ord. 3062. Passed 5-23-00.)
   1153.04 CERTIFICATES OF OCCUPANCY.
   (a)   No land shall be occupied or used and no structure hereafter erected,
altered or extended shall be used or changed in use until a certificate of
occupancy has been issued by the Building Official, stating that the structure
or proposed use thereof complies with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   A certificate of occupancy shall be applied for coincident with the
application for a building permit. A certificate of occupancy must also be
applied for at any time the owner of such land or structure desires to change
the use of such land or structure. The determination of whether such a
certificate shall be issued shall be made within five days after the building
permit has been approved, or within thirty-one days after the application for a
certificate of occupancy, whichever period is later.
   (c)   No nonconforming use shall be maintained, renewed, changed or extended
without a certificate of occupancy first being issued by the Building Official
therefor.
 
   (d)   The Building Official shall maintain a record of all certificates and
of all nonconforming uses, and copies shall be furnished, upon request, to any
person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the building affected.
 
   (e)   No permit for the excavation, erection, alteration or repair of any
structure shall be issued until an application has been made for a certificate
of occupancy.
(Ord. 2248. Passed 12-5-87; Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1153.99  PENALTY.
   The owner of any structure or premises or part thereof, where anything in
violation of this Zoning Code shall be placed or shall exist, and any
architect, builder or contractor who may be employed to assist in the
commission of any such violation, and all persons or corporations who or which
violate any of the provisions of this Zoning Code or fail to comply therewith,
or with any requirements thereof, or who or which build in violation of any
detailed statement of plans submitted and approved thereunder, shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than six months, or both. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a
violation or noncompliance occurs or continues.

   1163.09 BUILDING LINES; NEW STANDARDS.
   (a)   For the purpose of regulating front yards, for the purpose of further
regulating side yards of corner structures, and for the purpose of regulating
the alignment of structures near street frontages, building lines, as set forth
on the Zone Map which accompanies this Zoning Code and which is hereby declared
to be a part hereof, are hereby established. The Map designations and the Map
designation rules which accompany such Map are hereby declared to be a part
hereof.
 
   (b)   Between a building line and the street line, no structure or portion
of a structure extending above the established grade may be erected. In a Class
U1 District, a one-story unenclosed porch may, however, be constructed between

designated on the Zone Map, the location of the building line shall be as
follows:
      (1)   In a Class U1-A1 District and in the Class U1-A2 District, the
minimum distance between the building line and the established street line
shall be not less than 100 feet. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have
the power to increase this distance when it finds that it is desirable to do
so, to improve the relationship of the proposed building to adjacent structures
considering the average minimum setback on a particular street to establish the
distance of the building line back from the street line to be twenty percent of
the average or normal depth of the lots having their front lines on such street
frontage.
      (2)   In Class U1-A3 and U1-A4 Districts, on a street frontage on either
side of a street between two intersecting streets, but excluding the frontage
along the side line of a corner lot, the distance of the building line back
from the street line shall be twenty percent of the average or normal depth of
the lots having their front lines along such street frontage, but such distance
back from the street line need not be more than fifty feet, but in no case
shall it be less than fifty feet.
      (3)   In a Class U2 District, on a street frontage on either side of a
street between two intersecting streets, but excluding the frontage along the
side line of a corner lot, the distance back from the centerline of the street
shall be at least fifty feet.
      (4)   Certain exceptions because of unusual land contour conditions may
be specially approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals and by Council.
   (e)   For lots where no building line is designated on the Zone Map or on a
recorded plat and which have no immediate street frontage, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall have the authority to designate a lot line as the front
line of the lot, which shall be deemed to be the "street line" for the purposes
of front yard standards. In making this designation, the Planning and Zoning
Commission shall take into consideration the orientation of existing and

   (f)   No person shall erect, install or maintain any electrically-charged
fence or barbed wire fencing, except that the Building Official may issue a
permit for an electrically-charged fence or barbed wire fencing to retain
animals, upon proof that the fence will not be hazardous to life.
 
   (g)   No fence shall be erected or permitted which unduly interferes with
the migration of wildlife.
 
   (h)   The height limitations set forth in this section shall not apply to
front gate, entryway or driveway structures, provided, however, that such

reviewed and approved by the Architectural Board of Review, taking into
consideration, among other things, the size, shape, architectural character,
material, location and overall compatibility with structures on the lot and
neighborhood of the proposed structure.

cornice or unsupported bay window may project not over three feet into such
yard, provided that, if the structure is not over two and one-half stories in
height, the cornice or unsupported bay window may project not more than two and
one-half feet into such yard.
 
   (b)   A structure and any accessory structure erected on the same lot shall,
for the purpose of side and rear yard requirements, be considered a single
structure.
(Ord. 3053. Passed 3-14-00.)
   1163.18 BUILDING LINES; OLD STANDARDS.
   (a)   For the purpose of regulating front yards, for the purpose of further
regulating side yards of corner structures, and for the purpose of regulating
the alignment of structures near street frontages, building lines, as set forth
on the Zone Map which accompanies this Zoning Code and which is hereby declared
to be a part hereof, are hereby established. The Map designations and the Map
designation rules which accompany such Map are hereby declared to be a part
hereof.
 
   (b)   Between a building line and the street line, no structure or portion

      (6)   Certain exceptions, because of unusual land contour conditions, may
be specially approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals and Council, and be
granted. Where, in any portion of such street, there are lots of markedly less
depth than normal, the Planning and Zoning Commission, in defining and applying
this building line regulation, may, when in its opinion the general purpose and
intent of this section will be better served thereby, divide such street
frontage into sections for the application of the above twenty-percent building
line requirement. For the purpose of this subsection, the term "lot" shall
include unimproved parcels in separate ownership and unimproved lots or parcels
in subdivisions of land.
       (7)   In Class U1-A1, U1-A2, U1-A3 and U1-A4 Districts, along the side

of the side street shall be one-half the distance of the applicable front yard
setback.
 
   (e)   For lots where no building line is designated on the Zone Map or on a
recorded plat and which have no immediate street frontage, the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall have the authority to designate a lot line as the front
line of the lot, which shall be deemed to be the "street line" for the purposes
of front yard standards. In making this designation, the Planning Commission
shall take into consideration the orientation of existing and proposed
buildings on the lot and on surrounding lots.

loss of the natural beauty and visibility of the sky and stars).
   (b)   This chapter is intended to regulate exterior illumination to ensure
it is functional, glare-free, energy efficient and safe. Property owners and
designers of exterior lighting on properties in the Village are to consider the
impacts of their proposed exterior lighting on the purposes of this chapter set
forth in subpart (a) above and to minimize the impacts in the design phase.
   (c)   The specific goals are to:
      (1)   Preserve the nighttime rural village atmosphere of the community;
      (2)   Prevent glaring and offensive lighting;
      (3)   Conserve energy and encourage the use of efficient lighting
technology;
      (4)   Promote safety;
      (5)   Prevent light pollution;
      (6)   Provide clear guidance to builders, designers, and residents; and
      (7)   Minimize environmental impacts on light sensitive flora and fauna.

   1165.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meaning
herein indicated:
   (a)   AIMING ANGLE: when applied to exterior lighting, this term is
correctly used only with directional lighting systems. In this case, the aiming
angle is the angle between the center of the object or area being lighted and
the point on the ground directly beneath the luminaire.
   (b)   EXTERIOR LIGHTING SYSTEM: the installation of lamps, luminaires,
electrical wiring, controls and mounting hardware (poles or brackets) designed
to illuminate outdoor areas, landscape or buildings.
   (c)   FLOODLIGHT: a type of directional luminaire or lamp which may be
adjusted on site to project and direct light out and away from the mounting
location. Floodlights are typically designed to illuminate relatively large
areas.
   (d)   FLUORESCENT LIGHT SOURCE: a low pressure gas discharge lamp in the
form of a bulb or tube which utilizes a phosphor as the light-emitting element.
   (e)   FOOTCANDLE: a unit of illumination produced on a surface, all points
of which are one foot from a uniform point source of one candle.
   (f)   FULL CUT-OFF FIXTURE: a type of fixed directional outdoor luminaire
which emits no light above a horizontal plane through the optical center of the
luminaire or, alternatively, above an angle of 90 degrees where zero degrees is
the aim point on the ground directly beneath the luminaire.
   (g)   FULLY SHIELDED FIXTURE: a luminaire equipped with opaque hoods,
louvers or visors so as to completely block the light from going in other than
a specified direction.
   (h)   GLARE: the visual sensation produced by brightness in the field of
view that is sufficiently greater than the light level to which the eyes are
adapted so as to cause annoyance, discomfort or loss of visibility.
   (i)   HALOGEN LIGHT SOURCE: an incandescent lamp with halogen gas filling
typically designed to increase energy efficiency and lengthen lamp life
compared to standard incandescent lamps.
   (j)   HID LIGHT SOURCE: a lamp which utilizes a small gas arc discharge or
“high intensity discharge” as the light emitter. Examples of HID light sources
are mercury, metal halide and high pressure sodium lamps.
   (k)   ILLUMINANCE: the quantity of light arising at a surface divided by the
area of that surface, measured in footcandles.
   (l)   INCANDESCENT LIGHT SOURCE: a lamp containing a tungsten wire filament
heated to a high temperature as the light-emitting element.

containing an electrical and physical assembly of materials designed to convert
electricity into light.
   (n)   LANDSCAPE LIGHTING: lighting installed and arranged to primarily
illuminate “softscape” such as bushes, trees, vines, shrubs and flowers or
“hardscape” such as terraces, fences, bridges, walls (non-building),
sculptures, water features, ornaments, and formed earth shapes. Landscape
lighting may be automatically or manually switched provided that the operating
period extends only from dusk to midnight.
   (o)   LIGHT POLLUTION: wasted light directed into the sky which may result
in or contribute to sky glow and the loss of the natural beauty and visibility
of the sky and stars.
   (p)   LIGHT SOURCE: the light emitting portion (filament, arc tube or
element) of a lamp.
   (q)   LIGHT TRESPASS: outdoor lighting which emits unwanted light or glare
beyond the boundaries of the property on which the light source is located.
   (r)   LUMEN: the unit measure of light flux or light output from lamps and
luminaires.
   (s)   LUMINAIRE: a complete lighting unit typically consisting of all
electrical and mechanical parts necessary for operation including a lamp,
ballast (in the case of discharge lamps), optical assembly and enclosure.
   (t)   LUMINAIRE MOUNTING HEIGHT: the vertical distance between the ground
and the optical center of the luminaire in an outdoor lighting system.
   (u)   OPTICAL CENTER OF LUMINAIRE: the point inside of a luminaire at the
middle of the light emitting area of the light source.
   (v)   RECESSED CEILING FIXTURE: an outdoor lighting fixture recessed into a
canopy ceiling so that the bottom of the fixture, including the lens, does not
extend below the ceiling or canopy.
   (w)   RECREATIONAL LIGHTING: lighting of ball fields, courts, pools,
playgrounds, and/or other sports, play or recreational areas other than those
accessory to single family residences.

exceed 2,500 lumens; and
      (3)   Not more than one such permit shall be issued per residential
property during any consecutive 365-day period of time.
   (d)   Lighting Nuisance. Any exterior lighting which does not comply with
this chapter is declared to be a public nuisance. Upon receipt of a lighting
complaint, the Building Official shall investigate to determine compliance. If
lighting is found to be in violation of this chapter, the Building Official
shall proceed as set forth in Section
1165.09.
(Ord. 2016-23. Passed 10-10-16.)
   1165.04 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Lighting Plans. Full Lighting Plans shall be required prior to
installation of any Exterior lighting improvements or fixtures. Full Lighting
Plans shall contain all of the following:
      (1)   The location and height above grade of the luminaires;
      (2)   The wattage and type of each light source such as incandescent,
fluorescent, metal halide, etc.;
      (3)   The general type and appearance of each luminaire such as lantern,
globe, floodlight, full cut-off area luminaire, wall pack, downlight, etc.;
      (4)   Calculated or manufacturer-rated numerical values of total light
output (lumens) of the luminaire or luminaires and the light output above a
horizontal plane through the optical center of the luminaire if the light
output per lamp is greater than allowed by this chapter; and
      (5)   Building walls which are to be illuminated by wall-mounted or
facade- mounted luminaires shall be in conformance with Section
1165.04(c) including relevant building elevations showing the location of the
luminaires, their aiming direction and aiming angle, if directional, the
portions of the building walls to be illuminated, and their color.
   (b)   Light Trespass. An exterior system is considered to produce excessive
light trespass when the lighting source or sources (the light emitting portion
of the lamp) is:
      (1)   Visible from normal viewing positions on an adjacent property and
the maximum light output per lamp is greater than allowed by Section
1165.05; and/or
      (2)   The total light trespass over a property line shall be limited to
no more than 0.5 footcandle at the property line. All on-site lighting of
buildings, landscaping, and parking areas shall be designed so as not to shine
onto any adjacent property or building, or to cause glare that projects onto
any public street or into any vehicle thereon.
   (c)   Measurement. All light levels shall be measured in footcandles with a
direct- reading, portable light meter. Readings shall be taken only after the
unit has been exposed long enough to take a constant reading. Measurements
shall be taken at the property line, along a horizontal plane at a height of
three and one-half feet above the ground.
   (d)   Light Pollution. An exterior lighting system is considered to
contribute excessively to light pollution when light is emitted above a
horizontal plane through the optical center of the luminaire and if the maximum
light output per lamp is greater than allowed by Section
1165.05.
   (e)   Glare. An exterior lighting system is considered to produce glare when
the light source inside the luminaire is visible as seen from normal viewing
positions whether or not the light from the source is diffused or refracted by
lens optics, and the light output per lamp is greater than allowed by Section
1165.05.
   (f)   Lighting Controls. To minimize the amount of light trespass, light
pollution, excess lighting and energy use at night, unnecessary lighting shall
be switched off. The use of photocell or photocell/timer switches which allow
lighting to operate all night is prohibited. Motion sensor switches which turn
lights on only when activated by motion shall be permitted but only for a set
period of time not to exceed three (3) minutes after the motion ceases.

               C.   Elevation at which the full dewatering zone is stored above
the skimmer invert
               D.   Any temporary modification to permanent outlet orifices or
weirs required to ensure no discharge below the skimmer invert and only the
skimmer controls the discharge up to the top of the dewatering volume.
               E.   Calculations of the sediment storage volume, dewatering
volume and skimmer drawdown time shall also be provided
            (xi)   The location of permanent SCMs to be used to control
pollutants in stormwater after construction operations have been completed.

may require the SWP3 to include a Soils Engineering Report based upon his/her
determination that the conditions of the soils are unknown or unclear to the
extent that additional information is required to protect against erosion or
other hazards. This report shall be based on adequate and necessary test
borings, and shall contain all the information listed below. Recommendations
included in the report and approved by the Village of Gates Mills Engineer
shall be incorporated in the grading plans and/or other specifications for site
development.
         a.   Data regarding the nature, distribution, strength, and

            (Ord. 2016-45. Passed 12-13-16.)
1171.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).
   The approved SWP3, and the sediment and erosion controls, and non-sediment
pollution controls contained therein, shall be implemented upon the
commencement of construction. Perimeter controls must be installed two working
days prior to commencement of construction. The approved plan must be
implemented until the site reaches final stabilization. All properties adjacent
to the site of soil-disturbing activity shall be protected from soil erosion
and sediment run-off and damage, including, but not limited to, private
properties, natural and artificial waterways, wetlands, storm sewers and public
lands.
   It is the owner's responsibility to maintain current records of contractor
(s) responsible for implementation the SWP3 and providing that information to
the Village Engineer. The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact stormwater runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3. The applicant shall review the SWP3 with the primary contractor prior
to commencement of construction activities and keep a SWP3 training log to
demonstrate that this review had occurred.
   Erosion and sediment controls shall be designed, installed and maintained
effectively to minimize the discharge of pollutants during the course of earth
disturbing activities. The controls shall include the following minimum
components:
   (a)   Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
minimizing disturbance of steep slopes, designation of tree preservation areas
or other protective clearing or grubbing practices. Soil compaction shall be
minimized and, unless infeasible, topsoil shall be preserved. Provide and
maintain a 50-foot buffer of undisturbed natural vegetation around surface
waters of the state, or riparian or wetland setbacks, if applicable, whichever
is greater, unless maintaining this buffer is infeasible (e.g., stream
crossings for roads or utilities, or for channel and floodplain rehabilitation
and restoration). Direct stormwater to vegetated areas to increase sediment
removal and maximize stormwater infiltration.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. The amount of soil
exposed during construction activity shall be minimized. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization

Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques
must be employed.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels.  Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff within the site to prevent
erosion. Peak flow rates and total stormwater volume shall be controlled to
minimize erosion and outlets, downstream channel and streambank erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at discharge
locations and along the length of any outfall channel to provide non-erosive
flow velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical
and biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices.  The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas to minimize sediment discharges from
the site. Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more than 14 days. Such practices
may include, among others: sediment settling ponds, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or channels which direct runoff to
a sediment settling pond. The design, installation and maintenance of erosion
and sediment controls shall address factors such as the amount, frequency,
intensity and duration of precipitation, the nature of resulting stormwater
runoff, and soil characteristics, including the range of soil particle sizes
expected to be present on the site.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are
not considered a sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a
sediment settling pond.
      Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the Village of Gates Mills Engineer
and/or (if requested by the Village Engineer) the Cuyahoga SWCD, is required
for any one of the following conditions:
         a.   Concentrated stormwater runoff.
         b.   Runoff from drainage areas which exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence (see Table 3) inlet protection, or other sediment barriers;
         c.   Runoff from common drainage locations with 10 or more acres of
disturbed land.
Sediment settling ponds shall be provided in the form of a sediment trap or
sediment basin as defined in the latest edition of Rainwater and Land
Development. The maximum allowable contributing drainage area to a sediment
trap shall be limited to less than 5 acres. Contributing drainage areas of 5
acres or more shall be treated with a sediment basin. An equivalent best
management practice may be utilized upon approval from the Village of Gates
Mills.
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 1,800
cubic feet of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. The
dewatering structure of sediment basins shall be designed to have a minimum 48-
hour drain time, and, unless infeasible, be designed to always withdraw runoff
from the surface of the pond throughout the storm cycle. As such, a skimmer
discharge device consistent with Rainwater and Land Development shall be
provided to dewater sediment basins. Sediment traps shall also provide both a
sediment storage zone and dewatering zone, but the outlet structure shall be
constructed consistent with the specifications contained in the latest edition
of Rainwater and Land Development.
When post-construction detention/water quality ponds are to be used as
temporary sediment trapping BMPs, a skimmer discharge device consistent with
Rainwater and Land Development shall be utilized during construction phase and
until the site is deemed permanently stabilized by the Village of Gates Mills.
The skimmer shall be designed per the equivalent requirements of sediment
basins and the operator must ensure that the outlet structure of the pond
provides an equivalent or better sediment storage zone and dewatering zone. As
such, temporarily while the site is under construction, there shall be no
discharge of runoff below the elevation required for the sediment storage zone
and the discharge of stormwater within the dewatering zone shall only occur
through the skimmer.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods:
Method 1:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000ft3 per
disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
Method 2:   The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with RUSLE or other generally
accepted erosion prediction model.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not co-mingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone
must be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the
inlets and the outlet of the sediment-settling pond must provide at least four
units of length for each one unit of width ? 4:1 length-to-width ratio.
Sediment must be removed from the sediment-settling pond when the design
capacity of the sediment storage zone has been completely filled by sediment
accumulations. This limit is typically reached when sediment occupies one-half
of the basin depth. When designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must
consider public safety, especially as it relates to children, as a design
factor for the sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used
where site limitations would preclude a safe design. The use of a combination
of sediment and erosion control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant
removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties
and water resources from sediment transported via sheet flow. Where intended to
provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and
shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship between the
maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in
Table 3 below. Placing silt fence in a parallel series does not extend the size
of the permissible drainage area.
Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (acres) to 100 Range of slope for a drainage area (%)
linear feet of silt fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
 
   
      (4)   Alternative perimeter controls for sheet flow discharges may be
considered by the Village of Gates Mills, but their use shall not exceed the
limitations indicated in Table 3 above. Detail drawings and plan notes shall
specify the diameter of filter socks, compost berms and other such alternative
perimeter controls if used instead of silt fence.
      (5)   Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive stormwater runoff from areas up to 10 acres.
      (6)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage
areas of one or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay
bales and filter socks around catch basins are not acceptable forms of inlet
protection.
      (7)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control.  Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         a.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile fabric, and
constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development.
         b.   Streets and catch basins adjacent to construction entrances shall
be kept free of sediment tracked off site. Streets directly adjacent to
construction entrances and receiving traffic from the development area, shall
be cleaned daily to remove sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch
basins on these streets nearest to the construction entrances shall also be
cleaned weekly and protected from sediment-laden runoff, if feasible without
posing a public safety hazard.
Based on site conditions, the Village of Gates Mills Engineer and/or the
Cuyahoga SWCD may require additional best management practices to control off
site tracking and dust. These additional BMPs may include:
         c.   Fencing shall be installed around the perimeter of the
development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to designated
construction entrances.
         d.   Designated vehicle and wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these
areas must be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling
pond, or to a sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1171.09 (g) of this regulation. No surfactants or detergents may be used to
wash vehicles.
         e.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The Village of Gates Mills Engineer and/
or the Cuyahoga SWCD may require dust controls including the use of water
trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping stockpiles, temporary stabilization of
disturbed areas, and regulation of the speed of vehicles on the site.
      (8)   Surface Waters of the State protection. Construction vehicles shall
avoid water resources. A 50 foot undisturbed natural buffer shall be provided
around surface waters of the state unless infeasible. If it is infeasible to
provide and maintain an undisturbed 50-foot natural buffer, the SWP3 shall
comply with the stabilization requirements in
1171.09.B.1 for areas within 50 feet of a surface water or riparian or wetland
setbacks if applicable, whichever is greater; and minimize soil compaction and,
unless infeasible, preserve topsoil. If the applicant is permitted to disturb
areas within 50 feet of a water resource, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWP3:
         a.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
         b.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         c.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in water resources
or wetlands.
         d.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         e.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         f.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
         g.   Concentrated stormwater runoff from BMPs to natural wetlands
shall be converted to diffuse flow through the use of level spreaders or other
such appropriate measure before the runoff enters the wetlands. The flow should
be released such that no erosion occurs downslope. Level spreaders may need to
be placed in series to ensure non-erosive velocities.
         h.   Protected areas or critical areas, including wetlands and
riparian areas shall be physically marked in the field prior to earth
disturbing activities.
      (9)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (f)   Non-Sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in stormwater runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources, wetlands or
the MS4. These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste Materials: A covered dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      (2)   Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, other public facility, natural resource or water of the
state is prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made
available.
      (3)   Disposal of Other Wastewaters: The discharge of washout and
cleanout of stucco, paint, form release oils, curing compounds, and other
construction materials to a street, catch basin, other public facility, natural
resource or waters of the state is prohibited. The discharge of soaps or
solvents used in vehicle and equipment washing is also prohibited. If
generated, these wastewaters must be collected and disposed of properly.
      (4)   Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of the largest
containers in the storage area and/or a spill kit shall be provided to clean up
spills. The SWP3 shall contain spill prevention and response procedures and
these procedures shall be discussed at the pre-construction meeting.
      (5)   Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly. The discharge of fuels, oils, and other
pollutants used in vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance is
prohibited.
      (6)   Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Discovery of previously
unknown contaminated soils onsite shall be self-reported to Ohio EPA and local
authorities. Contaminated soils from redevelopment sites shall be disposed of
properly. Runoff from contaminated soils shall not be discharged from the site.
Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid waste
landfill sites or redevelopment sites. Where construction activities are to
occur on sites with contamination from previous activities, operators shall be
aware that concentrations of materials that meet other criteria (i.e. not
considered a Hazardous Waste, meeting Voluntary Action Program (VAP standards))
may still result in stormwater discharges in excess of Ohio Water Quality
Standards. Such discharges are not authorized by this code. Control measures
which may be utilized to meet this requirement include, but are not limited to:
         a.   Use berms, trenches, pits or tanks to collect contaminated runoff
and prevent discharge.
         b.   Pump runoff from contaminated soils to the sanitary sewer with
the prior approval of the sanitary sewer system operator, or pump into a
container for transport to an appropriate treatment or disposal facility; and
         c.   Cover areas of contamination with tarps, daily cover or other
such methods to prevent stormwater from coming into contact with contaminated
materials.
The SWP3 must include methods to minimize the exposure of building materials,
building products, construction wastes, trash, landscape materials,
fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, and sanitary waste to
precipitation, stormwater runoff, and snow melt. The SWP3 shall include
measures to prevent and respond to chemical spills and leaks. Applicants may
also reference the existence of other plans (i.e., Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure (SPCC) plans, spill control programs, Safety Response Plans,
etc.) provided that such plan addresses this requirement and a copy of such
plan is maintained on site.
      (7)   Compliance with Other Requirements.  The SWP3 shall be consistent
with applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic
system regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open
burning, and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils
located within the development area.
      (8)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden
or turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
      (9)   Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected a
at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm
event greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection
frequency may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is
temporarily stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g.,
site is covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of
inspection requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions
are expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been
attained from the Village of Gates Mills Engineer and/or the Cuyahoga SWCD and
all of the following conditions are met:
         a.   The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
         b.   Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
         c.   The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
         d.   For sites that will not be completed by October 1, a Pre-Winter
Stabilization Meeting shall be held by the landowner and the developer,
engineer and contractor of the project and the Village of Gates Mills prior to
October 1, in order to plan and approve winter erosion and sediment controls as
defined in the most current online edition of Rainwater and Land Development.
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls.
Inspections shall be conducted by the applicant's qualified person in
accordance with the intervals established by the NPDES Construction Stormwater
Permit for the site. Copies of the previous month's inspection reports will be
due to the office of the Village Engineer by the 5th of each month. The Village
Engineer will conduct monthly inspections of the site to confirm accurate
reporting and maintenance is being completed. If monthly reports and
maintenance activities are not completed in accordance with the above
requirements contained herein, the Village Engineer reserves the right to
conduct more frequent inspections to ensure that NPDES requirements are being
met. Certified inspection reports shall be submitted to the Village Engineer
within seven (7) working days from the inspection and retained at the
development site.
   These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
         a.   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
         b.   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3
shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant
shall utilize an inspection form provided by the Village of Gates Mills or an
alternate form acceptable to the Village of Gates Mills Engineer. The
inspection form shall include:
            (i)   The inspection date.
            (ii)   Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
            (iv)   Weather information for the period since the last
inspection, including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event,
duration of each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm
event in inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
            (v)   Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
            (vi)   Locations of:
               A.   Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
               B.   BMPs that need to be maintained.
               C.   BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location.
               D.   Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
            (vi)   Corrective action required including any necessary changes
to the SWP3 nd implementation dates.
         c.   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
         d.   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be
inspected for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
         e.   The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
      (10)   Maintenance.  The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All BMPs shall be maintained and repaired as needed to ensure
continued performance of their intended function until final stabilization. All
sediment control practices must be maintained in a functional condition until
all up slope areas they control reach final stabilization. The applicant shall
provide a description of maintenance procedures needed to ensure the continued
performance of control practices and shall ensure a responsible party and
adequate funding to conduct this maintenance, all as determined by the Village
of Gates Mills Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
         a.   When BMPs require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a BMP is in need of repair or maintenance, with the
exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or maintained within
three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be repaired or

   1173.01  INTENT.
   It is the intent of Council to preserve the woodland nature of the Village,
stabilize sloped grades, reduce surface runoff, erosion and downstream
flooding, retain areas of rainfall percolation into the water table, ameliorate
climatic and weather extremes, support wildlife and preserve the vegetational
aesthetics for which the Village is known. To this end this Council proposes,
when development requires the removal or reduction of trees and vegetation, to
reduce the number of potentially hazardous or otherwise undesirable trees and
vegetation, to select more beneficial trees and vegetation as opposed to less
beneficial, and to promote a mixture of ages and species of vegetation where it
naturally may occur. It is not the intent of Council to restrict or hinder
acceptable development within the Village, but only to establish guidelines for
development compatible with long-term preservation of the woodland environment.
(Ord. 2543. Passed 7-13-93.)
   1173.02  SCOPE.
   In general, a permit for tree cutting shall be required for any cutting of
trees within the Village, except for the purposes and exceptions listed in
Section
1173.04. The cutting and removal of trees in the Protected Hillside Zone shall
be governed by the specific rules applicable to that Zone and shall not be
governed by this chapter.
(Ord. 2543. Passed 7-13-93.)
   1173.03  PERMIT REQUIRED; MASTER VEGETATION PLAN.
   (a)   Whenever a property owner contemplates cutting of a tree or trees for
the purpose of construction of subdivision improvements, construction of new
structures, alteration of existing structures, construction of additions to
existing structures, gaining access to property, conducting any earth-
disturbing activity, obtaining a view, thinning of existing trees or
vegetation, creating a pasture, or in preparation for a recreation or other
use, the property owner must obtain a permit from the Building Official.
 
   (b)   A property owner applying for a lot split or a subdivision where tree
cutting is a logical consequence of the application must also comply with the
requirements of this chapter.
 
   (c)   Alternatively, a property owner may obtain a permit to cut a tree or
trees for up to ten years in accordance with a master vegetation plan. Such
master plan shall be reviewed and approved by the owner and by an experienced
arborist in concert with the owner. Such master plan shall provide for long-
term woodland management, and all cutting of trees or vegetation shall be in
strict accordance with the permit requiring adherence to such master plan. The
plan shall be binding upon the owner and his or her successors and assigns.
(Ord. 2543. Passed 7-13-93; Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1173.04  EXCEPTIONS.
   In addition to any exceptions established elsewhere in this Building and
Housing Code, no tree cutting permit shall be required for removal of trees
under the following conditions:
   (a)   Trees not in a Protected Hillside Zone, less than nine inches in
caliper (diameter) (measured fifty-four inches above the ground) may be cut
without a permit. However, where multiple trees of less than nine inches in
caliper (diameter) are to be cut for the purpose of creating a view, a plan and
permit are required.
   (b)   Property owners may cut not more than two trees per year larger than
nine inches in caliper (diameter) without a permit.
   (c)   Meadow maintenance under a long-term permit already issued may be done
without a new permit.
   (d)   Dead and diseased trees, and damaged trees which threaten life or
property, or which cannot be revived (e.g. blown off vertical), may be removed
without a permit. However, a tree-cutting contractor for such work must be
licensed. (See Section
1173.11.)
      (Ord. 2543. Passed 7-13-93.)
   1173.05  ACCEPTABLE TREE REMOVAL AREAS.
   The Building Official may grant a tree removal permit only in the following
areas:
   (a)   Within the area to be occupied by a permanent structure together with
fifteen feet on all sides, subject to Village approval of the location of the
structure.
   (b)   Within an area occupied by access roads, parking areas, accessory
buildings, sidewalks, utility installations and similar necessary development
(subject to Village approval of the location of said improvements).
   (c)   View corridors subject to the requirements of Chapter
1171 (Erosion and Sedimentation Control) and Chapter
1175 (Protected Hillside Zone) of the Planning and Zoning Code.
   (d)   Open areas not exceeding fifty percent of the lot (e.g. a meadow or
pasture) which, in the judgement of the Village, maintains the rural and
woodland atmosphere of the Village.
      (Ord. 2543. Passed 7-13-93; Ord. 2014-08. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1173.06  LOGGING FOR ECONOMIC GAIN PROHIBITED.
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, logging of trees for
economic gain is prohibited. Limited tree removal pursuant to Chapter
777 of the Codified Ordinances is permitted. For the purposes of this chapter,
“economic gain” means the cultivation, production, distribution, or sale of any
good or service for money, in-kind services, or any other thing of value.

CUTTING.
   Within two weeks of submittal of the plan, the Building Official will
approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove, the plan. If approved, the
Building Official shall issue a permit authorizing selective cutting of timber
but only after the Village representative and the owner or his or her
representative shall together inspect the area to be selectively cut, to red
ribbon the specific trees to be cut. Only trees so ribboned shall be cut. Each
unauthorized cutting of an unmarked tree shall constitute a separate violation
of this chapter and shall constitute grounds for the immediate revocation of
the permit.
(Ord. 2543. Passed 7-13-93; Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1173.10 PROTECTION OF TREES NOT TO BE CUT.
   The owner or his or her representative shall take all reasonable actions
necessary to protect all remaining trees on the property during construction.
To obtain a permit, a plan to protect other trees on the construction site must
be submitted and approved.
(Ord. 2543. Passed 7-13-93.)
   1173.11  CONTRACTOR'S LICENSE; FEE; EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   All contractors for tree cutting (other than the property owner) must obtain
a license from the Village before tree cutting begins. Tree cutting by a
licensed contractor must be in compliance with an approved tree cutting permit,
or fall within the exceptions set forth in Section
 1173.04. The license fee is five dollars ($5.00) and the license shall be
effective for one year.
(Ord. 2543. Passed 7-13-93.)

inches in caliper to be removed.
   (b)   A deposit of one hundred dollars ($100.00) or such larger or lesser
amount as may be determined by the Building Official based on his or her
estimate of cost to be incurred by the Village and the Village Arborist in
reviewing the application for a permit and to insure the payment by the
applicant of expenses incurred by the Village in processing the application and
pertinent papers connected therewith. The cost and expense of any investigation
carried out by the Building Official, the Village Arborist or such other
professionals and Village officials as may be necessary to determine whether or
not the proposed application is in accordance with law, the cost of any and all
notices required and all other necessary expenses shall be paid by the owner.
The actual expenses shall be paid by the owner upon demand of the Treasurer.
The unexpended balance of the deposit shall be refunded to the applicant upon

permit issued pursuant to Section
1173.03(c).
   (d)   The fee required by subsection (a) hereof may be waived, at the
discretion of the Building Official, in those circumstances where the Building
Official believes that the tree cutting is part of a long-term meadow
management or tree management plan consistent with the intent of this chapter.
      (Ord. 2543. Passed 7-13-93; Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1173.13  APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by any of the provisions of this chapter or a final
determination of the Building Official or the Village Arborist may appeal to
the Planning and Zoning Commission. Such appeal shall be taken within twenty
days after the date of the decision by filing with the Building Official and
the Village Clerk a notice of appeal specifying the grounds therefor. The
Building Official shall forthwith transmit to the Planning and Zoning
Commission all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed
was taken. The Planning and Zoning Commission may reverse or modify the
decision appealed only on the grounds of hardship shown by the appellant and

1174.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable stormwater management standards to achieve a level
of stormwater quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village of Gates Mills:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village of Gates Mills to:
      (1)   Control stormwater runoff from their property and ensure that all
Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of stormwater runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and groundwater are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate stormwater quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate stormwater management.
      (8)   Maximize use of SCMs that serve multiple purposes including, but
not limited to, flood control, erosion control, fire protection, water quality
protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village of Gates
Mills' future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream
crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1174.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the
Village of Gates Mills shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility line
installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface as
determined by the Village Engineer. Such projects must be designed to minimize
the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements of Chapter
1171 Erosion and Sediment Control. (Ord. 2016-46. Passed 12-13-16.)

1174.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   General: The stormwater system, including SCMs for storage, treatment
and control, and conveyance facilities, shall be designed to prevent structure
flooding during the 100-year, 24-hour storm event; to maintain predevelopment
runoff patterns, flows, and volumes; and to meet the following criteria:
      (1)   Integrated practices that address degradation of water resources.
The SCMs shall function as an integrated system that controls flooding and
minimizes the degradation of the physical, biological, and chemical integrity
of the water resources receiving stormwater discharges from the site.
Acceptable practices shall:
         a.   Not disturb riparian areas, unless the disturbance is intended to
support a watercourse restoration project.
         b.   Maintain predevelopment hydrology and groundwater recharge on as
much of the site as practicable.
         c.   Only install new impervious surfaces and compact soils where
necessary to support the future land use.
         d.   Compensate for increased runoff volumes caused by new impervious
surfaces and soil compaction by reducing stormwater peak flows to less than
predevelopment levels.
         e.   Be designed according to the methodology included in the most
current edition of Rainwater and Land Development or another design manual
acceptable for use by the Village of Gates Mills and Ohio EPA.
SCMs that meet the criteria in this regulation, and additional criteria
required by the Village Engineer, shall comply with this regulation.
      (2)   Practices designed for final use: SCMs shall be designed to achieve
the stormwater management objectives of this regulation, to be compatible with
the proposed post-construction use of the site, to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to function safely with routine maintenance.
      (3)   Stormwater management for all lots: Areas developed for a
subdivision, as defined in Chapter
1174, shall provide stormwater management and water quality controls for the
development of all subdivided lots. This shall include provisions for lot
grading and drainage that prevent structure flooding during the 100-year, 24-
hour storm; and maintain, to the extent practicable, the pre-development runoff
patterns, volumes, and peaks from each lot.
      (4)   Stormwater facilities in water resources:  SCMs and related
activities shall not be constructed in water resources unless the applicant
shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from the Ohio EPA, the
U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and local agencies as
required in Section
1174.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1171, all as determined by the Village Engineer.
      (5)   Stormwater ponds and surface conveyance channels: All stormwater
pond and surface conveyance designs must provide a minimum of one (1) foot
freeboard above the projected peak stage within the facility during the 100-
year, 24-hour storm. When designing stormwater ponds and conveyance channels,
the applicant shall consider public safety as a design factor and alternative
designs must be implemented where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
      (6)   Exemption: The site where soil-disturbing activities are conducted
shall be exempt from the requirements of Section
 1174.09 if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that
the site is part of a larger common plan of development where the stormwater
management requirements for the site are provided by an existing SCMs, or if
the stormwater management requirements for the site are provided by practices
defined in a regional or local stormwater management plan approved by the
Village Engineer.
      (7)   Maintenance: All SCMs shall be maintained in accordance with the
Inspection and Maintenance Plan and Agreements approved by the Village Engineer
as detailed in Section
1174.08.
      (8)   Ownership: Unless otherwise required by the Village of Gates Mills,
SCMs serving multiple lots in subdivisions shall be on a separate lot held and
maintained by an entity of common ownership or, if compensated by the property
owners, by the Village of Gates Mills. SCMs serving single lots shall be placed
on these lots, protected within an easement, and maintained by the property
owner.
      (9)   Preservation of Existing Natural Drainage: Practices that preserve
and/or improve the existing natural drainage shall be used to the maximum
extent practicable. Such practices may include minimizing site grading and
compaction; protecting and/or restoring water resources, riparian areas, and
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips; phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing and
grubbing practices; and maintaining unconcentrated stormwater runoff to and
through these areas. Post-construction stormwater practices shall provide
perpetual management of runoff quality and quantity so that a receiving
stream's physical, chemical and biological characteristics are protected and
ecological functions are maintained.
      (10)   Preservation of Wetland Hydrology: Concentrated stormwater runoff
from SCMs to wetlands shall be converted to diffuse flow before the runoff
enters the wetlands in order to protect the natural hydrology, hydroperiod, and
wetland flora. The flow shall be released such that no erosion occurs down
slope. Practices such as level spreaders, vegetative buffers, infiltration
basins, conservation of forest covers, and the preservation of intermittent
streams, depressions, and drainage corridors may be used to maintain the
wetland hydrology.
If the applicant proposes to discharge to natural wetlands, a hydrological
analysis shall be performed to demonstrate that the proposed discharge matches
the pre-development hydroperiods and hydrodynamics that support the wetland.
      (11)   Soil Preservation and Post-Construction Soil Restoration: To the
maximum extent practicable leave native soil undisturbed and protect from
compaction during construction. Except for areas that will be covered by
impervious surface or have been incorporated into an SCM, the soil moisture-
holding capacity of areas that have been cleared and graded must be restored to
that of the original, undisturbed soil to the maximum extent practicable. Areas
that have been compacted or had the topsoil or duff layer removed should be
amended using the following steps: 1. till subsoil to a depth of 15-18 inches,
2. incorporate compost through top 12 inches, 3. Replace with stockpiled site
or imported suitable topsoil to a minimum depth of 4 inches.
   (b)   Stormwater Conveyance Design Criteria: All SCMs shall be designed to
convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction
in flow velocities. This shall include but not be limited to:
      (1)   Surface water protection: The Village Engineer may allow
modification to streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands or other surface waters only
if the applicant shows proof of compliance with all appropriate permits from
the Ohio EPA, the U.S. Army Corps, and other applicable federal, state, and
local agencies as required in Section
 1174.07 of this regulation, and the activity is in compliance with Chapter
1171, all as determined by the Village Engineer. At a minimum, stream
relocation designs must show how the project will minimize changes to the
vertical stability, floodplain form, channel form, and habitat of upstream and
downstream channels on and off the property.
      (2)   Off-site stormwater discharges: Off-site stormwater runoff that
discharges to or across the applicant's development site shall be conveyed
through the stormwater conveyance system planned for the development site at
its existing peak flow rates during each design storm. Off-site flows shall be
diverted around stormwater quality control facilities or, if this is not
possible, the stormwater quality control facility shall be sized to treat the
off-site flow. Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans will not be approved
until it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer that off-
site runoff will be adequately conveyed through the development site in a
manner that does not exacerbate upstream or downstream flooding and erosion.
      (3)   Sheet flow: The site shall be graded in a manner that maintains
sheet flow over as large an area as possible. The maximum area of sheet flow
shall be determined based on the slope, the uniformity of site grading, and the
use of easements or other legally-binding mechanisms that prohibit re-grading
and/or the placement of structures within sheet flow areas. In no case shall
the sheet flow length be longer than 300 feet, nor shall a sheet flow area
exceed 1.5 acres. Flow shall be directed into an open channel, storm sewer, or
other SCMs from areas too long and/or too large to maintain sheet flow, all as
determined by the Village Engineer.
      (4)   Open channels:  Unless otherwise allowed by the Village Engineer,
drainage tributary to SCMs shall be provided by an open channel with vegetated
banks and designed to carry the 10 year, 24 hour stormwater runoff from
upstream contributory areas.
      (5)   Open drainage systems: Open drainage systems shall be preferred on
all new development sites to convey stormwater where feasible. Storm sewer
systems shall be allowed only when the site cannot be developed at densities
allowed under the Village of Gates Mills zoning or where the use of an open
drainage system affects public health or safety, all as determined by the
Village Engineer. The following criteria shall be used to design storm sewer
systems when necessary:
         a.   Storm sewers shall be designed such that they do not surcharge
from runoff caused by the 5 year, 24 hour storm, and that the hydraulic grade
line of the storm sewer stays below the gutter flow line of the overlying
roadway, or below the top of drainage structures outside the roadway during a
10 year, 24 hour storm. The system shall be designed to meet these requirements
when conveying the flows from the contributing drainage area within the
proposed development and existing flows from offsite areas that are upstream
from the development.
         b.   The minimum inside diameter of pipe to be used in public storm
sewer systems is 12 inches. Smaller pipe sizes may be used in private systems,
subject to the approval of the Village Engineer.
         c.   All storm sewer systems shall be designed taking into
consideration the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The
tailwater elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency. The
hydraulic grade line for the storm sewer system shall be computed with
consideration for the energy losses associated with entrance into and exit from
the system, friction through the system, and turbulence in the individual
manholes, catch basins, and junctions within the system.
         d.   The inverts of all curb inlets, manholes, yard inlets, and other
structures shall be formed and channelized to minimize the incidence of
quiescent standing water where mosquitoes may breed.
         e.   Headwalls shall be required at all storm sewer inlets or outlets
to and from open channels or lakes.
      (6)   Water Resource Crossings. The following criteria shall be used to
design structures that cross a water resource in the Village of Gates Mills:
         a.   Water resource crossings other than bridges shall be designed to
convey the stream's flow for the minimum 25 year, 24 hour storm.
         b.   Bridges, open bottom arch or spans are the preferred crossing
technique and shall be considered in the planning phase of the development.
Bridges and open spans should be considered for all State Scenic Rivers,
coldwater habitat, exceptional warmwater habitat, seasonal salmonid habitat
streams, and Class III headwater streams. The footers or piers for these
bridges and open spans shall not be constructed below the ordinary high water
mark.
         c.   If a culvert or other closed bottom crossing is used, twenty-five
(25) percent of the cross-sectional area or a minimum of 1 foot of box culverts
and pipe arches must be embedded below the channel bed. The conduit or
conveyance must to be sized to carry the 25-year storm under these conditions.
         d.   The minimum inside diameter of pipes to be used for crossings
shall be 12 inches.
         e.   The maximum slope allowable shall be a slope that produces a 10
fps velocity within the culvert barrel under design flow conditions. Erosion
protection and/or energy dissipaters shall be required to properly control
entrance and outlet velocities.
         f.   All culvert installations shall be designed with consideration
for the tailwater of the receiving facility or water resource. The tailwater
elevation used shall be based on the design storm frequency.
         g.   Headwalls shall be required at all culvert inlets or outlets to
and from open channels or lakes.
         h.   Streams with a drainage area of 5 square miles or larger shall
incorporate floodplain culverts at the bankfull elevation to restrict head loss
differences across the crossing so as to cause no rise in the 100-year storm
event.
         i.   Bridges shall be designed such that the hydraulic profile through
a bridge shall be below the bottom chord of the bridge for either the 100 year,
24 hour storm, or the 100 year flood elevation as determined by FEMA, whichever
is more restrictive.
      (7)   Overland flooding:  Overland flood routing paths shall be used to
convey stormwater runoff from the 100 year, 24 hour storm event to an adequate
receiving water resource or SCM such that the runoff is contained within the
drainage easement for the flood routing path and does not cause flooding of
buildings or related structures. The peak 100-year water surface elevation
along flood routing paths shall be at least one foot below the finished grade
elevation of all structures. When designing the flood routing paths, the
conveyance capacity of the site's storm sewers shall be taken into
consideration.
      (8)   Compensatory flood storage mitigation: In order to preserve
floodplain storage volumes and thereby avoid increases in water surface
elevations, any filling within floodplains approved by the Village of Gates
Mills must be compensated by providing an equivalent storage volume. First
consideration for the location(s) of compensatory floodplain volumes should be
given to areas where the stream channel will have immediate access to the new
floodplain within the limits of the development site. Consideration will also
be given to enlarging existing or proposed retention basins to compensate for
floodplain fill if justified by a hydraulic analysis of the contributing
watershed. Unless otherwise permitted by the Village of Gates Mills, reductions
in volume due to floodplain fills must be mitigated within the legal boundaries
of the development. Embankment slopes used in compensatory storage areas must
reasonably conform to the natural slopes adjacent to the disturbed area. The
use of vertical retaining structures is specifically prohibited.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation:  Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed
at discharge locations and along the length of any outfall to provide non-
erosive flow velocity from the structure to a water resource so that the
natural physical and biological characteristics and functions of the water
resource are maintained and protected.
   (c)   Stormwater Quality Control:
      (1)   Direct runoff to an SCM: The site shall be designed to direct
runoff to one or more of the following SCMs. These practices are listed in
Table 2 of this regulation and shall be designed to meet the following general
performance standards:
         a.   Extended detention facilities that detain stormwater; settle or
filter particulate pollutants; and release the controlled stormwater to a water
resource.
         b.   Infiltration facilities that retain stormwater; promote settling,
filtering, and biodegradation of pollutants; and infiltrate captured stormwater
into the ground. The Village Engineer may require a soil engineering report to
be prepared for the site to demonstrate that any proposed infiltration
facilities meet these performance standards.
For sites less than five (5) acres, but required to create a comprehensive
stormwater management plan, the Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if the
applicant demonstrates to the Village Engineer's satisfaction that these SCMs
meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
1174.09.C.6.
         c.   For sites greater than five (5) acres, or less than five (5)
acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will
disturb five (5) or more acres, the Village Engineer may approve other SCMs if
the applicant demonstrates to the Village Engineer's satisfaction that these
SCMs meet the objectives of this regulation as stated in Section
 1174.09.C.6, and has prior written approval from the Ohio EPA.
         d.   For the construction of new roads and roadway improvement
projects by public entities (i.e. the state, counties, townships, cities, or
villages), the Village Engineer may approve SCMs not included in Table 2 of
this regulation, but must show compliance with the current version of the Ohio
Department of Transportation "Location and Design Manual, Volume Two Drainage
Design".
      (2)   Criteria applying to all SCMs. SCMs chosen must be sized to treat
the water quality volume (WQv) and to ensure compliance with Ohio Water Quality
Standards (OAC Chapter 3745-1).
         a.   The WQv shall be equal to the volume of runoff from a 0.75 inch
rainfall event and shall be determined according to one of the following
methods:
            (i)   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the Village
Engineer that uses continuous hydrologic simulation; site-specific hydrologic
parameters, including impervious area, soil infiltration characteristics,
slope, and surface routing characteristics; proposed SCMs controlling the
amount and/or timing of runoff from the site; and local long-term hourly
records, or
            (ii)   Using the following equation:
               WQV = C*P*A/12
               where terms have the following meanings:
               WQV   =    water quality volume in acre-feet
               C    =    runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1
in.
               P   =    0.75 inch precipitation depth
               A   =    area draining into the stormwater practice, in acres.
Runoff coefficients required by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (Ohio
EPA) for use in determining the WQv can be determined using the list in Table 1
or using the following equation to calculate the runoff coefficient:
C=0.858i3 - 0.78i2 + 0.774i+0.04, where:   
i = fraction of the drainage area that is impervious
Table 1: Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (>8 dwellings/acre)       0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
Where land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage
area to the stormwater treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is
High Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is
calculated as follows (0.6)(0.3)+(0.3)(0.5)+(0.1)(0.2) = (0.35)
 
   
         b.   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQv shall be
incorporated into the stormwater practice for sediment storage. This volume
shall be incorporated into the sections of stormwater practices where
pollutants will accumulate.
         c.   Each individual SCM must be sized to treat the WQv associated
with its entire contributing drainage area. Exceptions to this may be granted
by the Village Engineer and/or the OEPA on a case-by-case basis.
         d.   Stormwater quality management practices shall be designed such
that the drain time is long enough to provide treatment and protect against
downstream bank erosion, but short enough to provide storage available for
successive rainfall events as defined in Table 2.
         e.   Sites within watersheds of coldwater habitat streams shall
include SCMs to infiltrate the water quality volume or reduce the temperature
of discharged runoff. SCMs that reduce the temperature of discharged runoff
include bioretention, permeable pavement, underground detention, and
incorporation of shading and infiltration in parking lot design.
         f.   Each practice shall be designed to facilitate sediment removal,
vegetation management, debris control, and other maintenance activities defined
in the Inspection Plan and Maintenance Agreement for the site.

1 Practices designed to fully infiltrate the WQv shall empty within 48 hours
to provide storage for subsequent storm events.
2 The use of a forebay and micropool is required on all dry extended detention
basins. Each is to be sized at a minimum 10% of the WQv.
3 Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized with at least 0.75*WQV .
4 Extended detention shall be provided for the WQv above the permanent water
pool.
5 The surface ponding area shall completely empty within 24 hours so that
there is no standing water. Shorter drawdown times are acceptable as long as
design criteria in Rainwater and Land Development have been met.
6 This includes grassed linear bioretention, which was previously titled
enhanced water quality swale.
7 Pocket wetlands must have a wet pool equal to the WQv, with 25% of the WQv
in a pool and 75% in marshes. The EDv above the permanent pool must be equal
to the WQv.
 
 
      (3)   Additional criteria applying to infiltration facilities.
         a.   Infiltration facilities should be designed to meet all criteria
in Rainwater and Land Development.
         b.   All runoff directed into an infiltration basin must first flow
through a pretreatment practice such as a grass channel or filter strip to
remove coarser sediments that could cause a loss of infiltration capacity.
         c.   During construction, all runoff from disturbed areas of the site
shall be diverted away from the proposed infiltration basin site. No
construction equipment shall be allowed within the infiltration basin site to
avoid soil compaction.
      (4)   Additional criteria for extended detention facilities:
         a.   The outlet shall be designed to not release more than the first
half of the water quality volume in less than 1/3rd of the drain time. The
outlet shall be designed to minimize clogging, vandalism, maintenance, and
promote the capture of floatable pollutants.
         b.   The basin design shall incorporate the following features to
maximize multiple uses, aesthetics, safety, and maintainability:
            (i)   Basin side slopes above the permanent pool shall have a run
to rise ratio of 4:1 or flatter.
            (ii)   The perimeter of all permanent pool areas deeper than 4 feet
shall be surrounded by an aquatic bench that extends at least 8 feet and no
more than 15 feet outward from the normal water edge. The 8 feet wide portion
of the aquatic bench closest to the shoreline shall have an average depth of 6
inches below the permanent pool to promote the growth of aquatic vegetation.
The remainder of the aquatic bench shall be no more than 15 inches below the
permanent pool to minimize drowning risk to individuals who accidentally or
intentionally enter the basin, and to limit growth of dense vegetation in a
manner that allows waves and mosquito predators to pass through the vegetation.
The maximum slope of the aquatic bench shall be 10 (H) to 1 (V). The aquatic
bench shall be planted with native plant species comparable to wetland
vegetation that are able to withstand prolonged inundation. The use of invasive
plant species is prohibited.
            (iii)   A forebay designed to allow larger sediment particles to
settle shall be placed at basin inlets. The forebay and micropool volume shall
be equal to at least 10% of the water quality volume (WQv).
            (iv)   Detention basins shall be provided with an emergency drain,
where practicable, so that the basin may be emptied if the primary outlet
becomes clogged and/or to drain the permanent pool to facilitate maintenance.
The emergency drain should be designed to drain by gravity where possible.
      (5)   Criteria for the Acceptance of Alternative post-construction SCMs:
The applicant may request approval from the Village Engineer for the use of
alternative structural post-construction SCMs if the applicant shows to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer that these SCMs are equivalent in
pollutant removal and runoff flow/volume reduction effectiveness to those
listed in Table 2. If the site is greater than five (5) acres, or less than
five (5) acres but part of a larger common plan of development or sale which
will disturb five (5) or more acres, prior approval from the Ohio EPA is
necessary. To demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant must show:
         a.   The alternative SCM has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         b.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected SCM is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the SCM will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            (i)   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            (ii)   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            (iii)   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
            (iv)   The stormwater drainage system of the development discharges
directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where
the development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a (TMDL) has identified water quality problems in the
receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Stormwater Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Stormwater Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed SCMs are designed to meet the following
requirements for stormwater quantity control for each watershed in the
development:
      (1)   The peak discharge rate of runoff from the Critical Storm and all
more frequent storms occurring under post-development conditions shall not
exceed the peak discharge rate of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring
on the same development drainage area under pre-development conditions.
      (2)   Storms of less frequent occurrence (longer return periods) than the
Critical Storm, up to the 100-year, 24-hour storm shall have peak runoff
discharge rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions. The 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year
storms shall be considered in designing a facility to meet this requirement.
      (3)   The Critical Storm for each specific development drainage area
shall be determined as follows:
         a.   Determine, using a curve number-based hydrologic method or other
hydrologic method approved by the Village Engineer, the total volume (acre-
feet) of runoff from a 1-year, 24-hour storm occurring on the development
drainage area before and after development. These calculations shall meet the
following standards:
            (i)   Calculations shall include the lot coverage assumptions used
for full build out as proposed.
            (ii)   Calculations shall be based on the entire contributing
watershed to the development area.
            (iii)   Model pervious, directly connected impervious and
disconnected impervious areas as separate subwatersheds.
            (iv)   Drainage area maps shall include area, curve number, time of
concentrations. Time of concentration shall also show the flow path and the
separation in flow type.
            (v)   Rainfall Depth - For the most accurate, up-to-date, location-
specific rainfall data for stormwater design, use the Precipitation-Frequency
Atlas of the United States, NOAA Atlas 14, Vol 2(3). [available online: http://
hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/.]
            (vi)   Temporal Distribution - Use the SCS Type II rainfall
distribution for all design events with a recurrence interval greater than 1
year. Include lot coverage assumptions used for full build out of the proposed
condition.
            (vii)   Curve numbers for the pre-development condition shall
reflect the average type of land use over the past 10 years and not only the
current land use.
               A.   Pre-development Curve Numbers - For wooded or brushy areas,
use listed values from TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,
1986 in good hydrologic condition. For meadows, use listed values. For all
other areas (including all types of agriculture), use pasture, grassland, or
range in good hydrologic condition.
               B.   Post-development Curve Numbers - Open space areas shall use
post-construction HSGs from Rainwater and Land Development unless the soil is
amended after development according to the following protocol: till the subsoil
to 15-18 inches, then till using a chisel, spader, or rotary tillage and
incorporate compost through top 12 inches, replace topsoil to a minimum depth
of 4 inches. All undisturbed areas or open space with amended soils shall be
treated as "open space in good condition."
            (viii)   Time of Concentration - Use velocity based methods from
(TR-55 NRCS USDA Urban Hydrology in Small Watersheds, 1986) to estimate travel
time (Tt) for overland (sheet) flow, shallow concentrated flow and channel
flow.
               A.   Maximum sheet flow length is 100 ft.
               B.   Use the appropriate "unpaved" velocity equation for shallow
concentrated flow from Soil Conservation Service National Engineer Handbook
Section 4 - Hydrology (NEH-4).
            (ix)   The volume reduction provided by permeable pavement,
bioretention, or other LID SCMs may be subtracted from the post development
stormwater volume. Volume reductions for these practices may be demonstrated
using methods outlined in Rainwater and Land Development or a hydrologic model
acceptable to the Village Engineer.
         b.   To account for future post-construction improvements to the site,
calculations shall assume an impervious surface such as asphalt or concrete for
all parking areas and driveways, regardless of the surface proposed in the site
description except in instances of engineered permeable pavement systems. From
the volume determined in Section
1174.09(d)(3)a., determine the percent increase in volume of runoff due to
development. Using the percentage, select the 24-hour Critical Storm from Table
3.
Table 3: 24-Hour Critical Storm
If the Percentage of Increase in Volume of Runoff is: The Critical Storm
Equal to or Greater Than: and Less Than:              will be:

---                       10                          1 year
10                        20                          2 year
20                        50                          5 year
50                        100                         10 year
100                       250                         25 year
250                       500                         50 year
500                       ---                         100 year
For example, if the percent increase between the pre- and post-development
runoff volume for a 1-year storm is 35%, the Critical Storm is a 5-year
storm. The peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency
shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1-
year frequency storm under pre-development conditions in the development
drainage area. The post-development runoff from all less frequent storms need
only be controlled to meet pre-development peak discharge rates for each of
those same storms.
 
   (e)   Stormwater Management on Redevelopment Projects. 
   (1)   Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plans for redevelopment projects
must accomplish one of the following options:
         a.   Reduce existing site impervious areas by at least 25 percent, a
one-for-one credit towards the 25 percent net reduction of impervious area can
be obtained through the use green roofs.
         b.   Infiltrate at least 25 percent of the WQv.
         c.   Capture, treat and release 50 percent of the WQv.
      (2)   Where projects are a combination of new development and
redevelopment, the total water quality volume required to be treated shall be
calculated by a weighted average based on acreage, with the new development at
100 percent water quality volume and redevelopment at 25% infiltration of the
WQv or 50% treatment of the WQv.
      (3)   Where conditions prevent impervious area reduction or on-site
stormwater management for redevelopment projects, practical alternatives as
detailed in Section
 1174.10 may be approved by the Village Engineer.
         (Ord. 2016-46. Passed 12-13-16.)
1174.10  ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   (a)   When the Village of Gates Mills determines that site constraints
compromise the intent of this regulation, off-site alternatives may be used

quantity. Such alternatives shall meet the following standards:
      (1)   Shall achieve the same level of stormwater quantity and quality
control that would be achieved by the on-site controls required under this
regulation.
      (2)   Implemented in the same Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed
unit as the proposed development project.
      (3)   The mitigation ratio of the water quality volume is 1.5 to 1 or the

         (Ord. 2016-46. Passed 12-13-16.)
1174.11 EASEMENTS.
   Access to SCMs as required by the Village Engineer for inspections and
maintenance shall be secured by easements. The following conditions shall apply
to all easements:
   (a)   Easements shall be included in the Inspection and Maintenance
Agreement submitted with the Comprehensive Stormwater Management Plan.
   (b)   Easements shall be approved by the Village of Gates Mills prior to
approval of a final plat and shall be recorded with the Cuyahoga Auditor and on
all property deeds.
   (c)   Unless otherwise required by the Village Engineer, access easements
between a public right-of-way and all SCMs shall be no less than 25-feet wide.
The easement shall also incorporate the entire practice plus an additional 25-

of Gates Mills and Inspection and Maintenance Agreement has been signed by the
developer, the contractor, the Village of Gates Mills, and the private owner or
homeowners association who will take long term responsibility for these SCMs,
is accepted by the Village Engineer.
   (b)   Once these criteria are met, the applicant shall be reimbursed all
bond monies that were not used for any part of the project. If all of these
criteria are not met after three years of permanent stabilization of the site,
the Village of Gates Mills may use the bond monies to fix any outstanding
issues with all stormwater management structures on the site and the remainder
of the bond shall be given to the private lot owner/homeowners association for
the purpose of long term maintenance of the project. (Ord. 2016-46. Passed 12-
13-16.)
1174.16 INSTALLATION OF WATER QUALITY STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   The applicant may not direct runoff through any water quality structures or
portions thereof that would be degraded by construction site sediment until the
entire area tributary to the structure has reached final stabilization as
determined by the Village Engineer. This occurs after the completion of the
final grade at the site, after all of the utilities are installed, and the site
is subsequently stabilized with vegetation or other appropriate methods. The
developer must provide documentation acceptable to the Village Engineer to
demonstrate that the site is completely stabilized. Upon this proof of
compliance, the water quality structure(s) may be completed and placed into
service. Upon completion of installation of these practices, all disturbed
areas and/or exposed soils caused by the installation of these practices must
be stabilized within 2 days.
(Ord. 2016-46. Passed 12-13-16.)

   1175.01  INTENT.
   (a)   The Protected Hillside Zone areas of the Village differ from other
areas of the Village because the hillsides and unique scenic resources and
scenic river areas necessitate different provisions for their development and
their protection.
 
   (b)   The Protected Hillside Zone regulations provided in this chapter are
established to achieve, among others, the following objectives:
      (1)   To protect public and private property owners from damage to human
life and safety, and to property, that could potentially be caused by increased
hillside instability.
      (2)   To assure access to properties within the Protected Hillside Zone
by emergency police and fire vehicles to protect persons and property.
      (3)   To preserve and protect the unique scenic resources and scenic
river habitats in the Protected Hillside Zone.
      (4)   To preserve and protect the valuable hydrological systems, fragile
hillsides and valuable flora and fauna in the Protected Hillside Zone.
      (5)   To permit, subject to the best available technology, development on
Protected Hillside Zone areas while conserving and promoting the public health,
safety, convenience and general welfare by minimizing problems due to water
runoff and soil erosion incurred in adjustment of the topography to meet
developmental needs.
      (6)   To use the best accepted design, landscape architecture,
architecture, civil engineering and hydrological engineering to preserve,
enhance and promote the existing and future appearance and resources in
Protected Hillside Zone areas.
      (7)   To preserve and enhance the natural beauty of Protected Hillside
Zone areas by encouraging the maximum retention of natural topographical
features such as natural drainage swales, streams, slope ridge lines, rock
outcropping, vistas from and of the hillside, trees and other natural plant
formations, and to retain the sense of identity and image that the Protected
Hillside Zone areas now impart to the Village.
      (8)   To complement the other actions of the Council, including the
enactment of an erosion control ordinance, the enactment of a vegetation
preservation ordinance and the designation, along with other communities, of
the Chagrin River Corridor as a "Scenic Corridor" which should be protected and
preserved.

   1176.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)    It is hereby determined that the system of rivers, streams, and other
natural watercourses within the Village of Gates Mills contributes to the
health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the Village of Gates
Mills. The specific purpose and intent of this chapter is to regulate uses and
developments within riparian setbacks that would impair the ability of riparian
areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters, and regulating base flow;
      (2)    Assist stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce woody
debris from fallen or damaged trees, streambank erosion, and the downstream
transport of sediments eroded from watercourse banks;
      (3)    Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses;
      (4)    Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling, and
transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses;
      (5)    Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food;
      (6)    Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a
diverse aquatic system;
      (7)    Provide habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse
and connected riparian vegetation; and
      (8)    Benefit the Village of Gates Mills by minimizing encroachment on
watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as
gabion baskets and rip rap to protect structures and reduce property damage and
threats to the safety of watershed residents; and by contributing to the scenic
beauty and environment of the Village of Gates Mills, and thereby preserving
the character of the Village of Gates Mills, the quality of life of the
residents of the Village of Gates Mills, and corresponding property values.
   (b)    The regulations in this chapter have been enacted to protect and
enhance these functions of riparian areas by providing reasonable controls
governing structures and uses within a riparian setback along designated
watercourses in the Village of Gates Mills.

provisions of law, chapter, contract, or deed, or the legal remedies available
thereunder, except as provided in Section
1176.03(a) of this chapter.
   (c)    If any clause, section, or provision of this chapter is declared
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, validity of
the remainder shall not be affected thereby.

(Ord. 2020-9. Passed 10-13-20.)
   1176.10 VARIANCES WITHIN RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   (a)    The Planning and Zoning Commission may grant a variance to this
chapter as provided herein. In granting a variance, the following conditions
shall apply:
      (1)   In determining whether there is unnecessary hardship with respect
to the use of a property or practical difficulty with respect to maintaining
the riparian setback as established in this chapter, such as to justify the
granting of a variance, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the
potential harm or reduction in riparian functions that may be caused by a
proposed structure or use;
      (2)    The Planning and Zoning Commission may not authorize any structure
or use in a Zoning District other than those authorized in the Zoning Code; and
      (3)    Variances shall be void if not fully implemented within one (1)
year of the date of approval.
   
   (b)    In making a determination under Section
1176.10(a) of this chapter, the Planning and Zoning Commission may consider the
following:
      (1)   The natural vegetation of the property as well as the percentage of
the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of Chapter
1341, Flood Damage Prevention, of the Village Codified Ordinances may be used
as guidance when granting variances in the 100-year floodplain;
      (2)    The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, erosion control, water quality protection, or other functions of the
riparian setback. This determination shall be based on sufficient technical and
scientific data;
      (3)    The degree of hardship, with respect to the use of a property or
the degree of practical difficulty with respect to maintaining the riparian
setback as established in this chapter, placed on the landowner by this chapter
and the availability of alternatives to the proposed structure or use;
      (4)    Soil-disturbing activities permitted in the riparian setback
through variances should be implemented to minimize clearing to the extent
possible and to include Best Management Practices necessary to minimize erosion
and control sediment;
      (5)    The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in the riparian setback compromises its benefits to
the Village. Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete paving in
the riparian setback. Variances may be granted for gravel driveways when
necessary; and
      (6)    Whether a property, otherwise buildable under the ordinances of
the Village, will be made unbuildable because of this chapter.
   (c)    In order to maintain the riparian setback to the maximum extent
practicable, the Planning and Zoning Commission may consider granting variances
to other area or setback requirements imposed on a property by the Zoning Code.
These may include, but are not limited to, parking requirements, requirements
for the shape, size, or design of buildings, or front, rear, or side lot
setbacks.
   
   (d)    In granting a variance under this chapter, the Planning and Zoning
Commission, for good cause, may impose such conditions that it deems
appropriate to maintain the purposes of this chapter and to mitigate any
necessary impacts in the riparian setbacks permitted by variance. In
determining appropriate mitigation, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
consult with the Village Engineer or other agencies including Cuyahoga SWCD.
(Ord. 2020-9. Passed 10-13-20.)
   1176.11 PROCEDURES FOR VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
   Any applicant seeking a variance to the conditions imposed under this
chapter or an appeal to an administrative decision made under this chapter,
other than a decision by the Planning and Zoning Commission, may apply to or
appeal to the Planning and Zoning Commission pursuant to the method prescribed
in Village Codified Ordinance Chapter
1153.
(Ord. 2020-9. Passed 10-13-20.)
   1176.12 INSPECTION OF RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   The identification of riparian setbacks shall be inspected by the Village:
   (a)    Prior to soil disturbing activities authorized under this chapter.
The applicant shall provide the Village with at least two (2) working days
written notice prior to starting such soil disturbing activities; and
   (b)    Any time evidence is brought to the attention of the Village that
uses or structures are occurring that may reasonably be expected to violate the
provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 2020-9. Passed 10-13-20.)
   1176.99 PENALTY.
   (a)    Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor of the first degree and shall be fined not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisoned not more than six months, or both. A
separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a
violation or noncompliance occurs or continues. Full restoration is required of
the riparian setback through a restoration plan approved by the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
   (b)    The imposition of any specific penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the Village from instituting an appropriate action or proceeding in a
court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful development, or to
restrain, correct, or abate a violation of, or to require compliance with the
provisions of this chapter or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules,
regulations, or the orders of the Village Building Official or that Official's
designee.

   (a)   Generally. The Architectural Board of Review, hereinafter established,
shall serve to protect and preserve the value, appearance and use of property
on which buildings are constructed or altered, to maintain a high character of
community development, to protect the public health, safety, convenience and
welfare and to protect real estate within the Village from impairment or
destruction of value. Such purposes shall be accomplished by the Board by
regulating, according to accepted and recognized architectural principles, the
design, use of materials, finished grade lines, dimensions, orientation and
location of all main and accessory buildings to be created, moved, altered,
remodeled or repaired, subject to the provisions of this Building and Housing
Code, the Planning and Zoning Code, the Fire Prevention Code and other
applicable ordinances of the Village. In reviewing, regulating and approving a

of adjacent, contiguous and neighboring buildings and properties for the
purpose of achieving safe, harmonious and integrated development of related
properties.
   When requested, the Board shall act in an advisory capacity to any officer,

determines that the establishment of restrictions on the construction,

preservation of the educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of the
Village and of its residents. Council further finds and determines, on the
basis of its own observations and knowledge and on the basis of the preliminary
study, that the following purposes will be served by the establishment of such
restrictions by this chapter:
      (1)   Promotion of the use and preservation of historic buildings,
structures and sites which reflect the cultural, social, economic, political or
architectural heritage of the Village for the education and general welfare of
the residents of the Village;
      (2)   Protection and enhancement of the attractiveness of the Village as
it relates to residents, tourists and visitors, serving as a support and
stimulant to business, and thereby strengthening the economy of the Village and
its residents;
      (3)   Stabilization and increase of property values within the Village;
      (4)   Compatibility of any and all construction of new improvements and
buildings and modifications of existing structures with the historic
architectural character of the Village;
      (5)   Enhancement of the visual and aesthetic character, diversity and
interests of the Village;
      (6)   Preservation and further enhancement of civic pride of the
residents of the Village in the beauty of the Village and in the notable

   (e)   Upon receipt of the Planning Commission's recommendation, the Council
shall cause an appropriate ordinance to be prepared stating the reason for the
designation of a historic landmark or the establishment of a historic property.
The ordinance shall be placed on the agenda for the next regularly scheduled
Council meeting.
   (f)   Council shall give due consideration to the findings and
recommendations of the Historic District Subcommittee, the Board, and the

   (i)   No legislation under this section shall be rendered invalid by any
failure or alleged failure to provide a prescribed notice by mail or otherwise
by person.
   (j)   Designation of a historic property or landmark shall be considered a
zoning district overlay with the regulations of the underlying zoning district
remaining in effect for any property designated as a landmark or included in
the historic district.
   (k)   Following the designation of the landmark or historic property, the
Board may place or cause to be placed on such landmark an official Village
plaque, indicating that such property or part thereof has been designated a
landmark in the Village. In the case of an area designation, the Board may
place or cause to be placed official village plaques at appropriate location(s)
near all entranceways to the new district. These official plaques shall remain
the property of the Village.

   1313.09 REVIEW PROCEDURE FOR THE HISTORIC DISTRICT AND HISTORIC LANDMARKS.
    (a)   No building permit for the construction, erection, alteration,
removal, moving or
demolition of any structure or building in the Historic District, or for the
alteration, removal, moving or demolition of any historic landmark, shall be
issued where such action will affect the exterior architectural feature of any
such structure or building, unless and until such application has been approved
by the Board. All submissions to the Board shall be made through the Building
Official who shall receive all materials from the applicant at least seven days
before the next regular or special meeting of the Board's Historic District
Subcommittee. Upon application for a building permit with respect to any
structure or building in the above categories, the Building Official shall
submit such application, together with the related plans and specifications,
within seven days of receipt thereof, directly to the Historic District
Subcommittee for its review at its next regular or special meeting. Upon the
Building Official's receipt of an application under this subsection (a), the
Official shall also forward the application, together with the related plans
and specifications, to the Board. (Ord. 2023-23. Passed 9-19-23.)
   (b)   At its first regular or special meeting after receipt by the Historic
District Subcommittee of the building permit application and related materials
for any such proposed construction, erection, alteration, removal, moving or
demolition, the Subcommittee shall consider the application. At that meeting,
or at such later meetings as may be necessary, the Historic District
Subcommittee shall consider the application and make a recommendation to the
Board of "approval," "disapproval" or "approval with conditions."
   (c)   In making such a determination the Historic District Subcommittee
shall refer to the Design Review Standards set forth in Section
 1313.091 and to the Historic District Guidelines as adopted by the Board and
Village Council.
   (d)   If, at the first regular or special meeting of the Board after receipt
of the report of the Subcommittee and the building permit application and
related materials for any such proposed construction, erection, alteration,
removal moving or demolition, the Board fails to approve the application in
accordance with subsection (e) hereof, it shall either:
      (1)   Review the material and refer its recommendations back to the
Subcommittee for further recommendation so that the Board may take final action
in accordance with subsection (e) hereof; or
      (2)   Set the matter for a public hearing and further consideration in
accordance with subsection (f) hereof.
   (e)   At a regular or special meeting of the Board, after receipt of the
report from the Subcommittee and the building permit application and related
materials for any such proposed construction, erection, alteration, removal,
moving or demolition, the Board shall consider the application and determine
whether or not to approve the same. If approved in accordance with the report
of the Subcommittee, the Board shall, within five days, authorize the Building
Official to issue a permit for the requested construction, erection,
alteration, removal, moving or demolition, and shall further notify the
Subcommittee.
   (f)   If the Board fails to approve the application at such meeting, it
shall give notice of a public hearing to be held within thirty-one days from
the date of such meeting to consider such application. However, the applicant
may waive this time requirement and consent to an extension of such time
period. Such notice shall be published once in a newspaper having general
circulation within the Village and shall be published not less than ten days
prior to such hearing. The applicant shall be advised of the time and place of
such hearing by a notice sent by certified mail addressed to him or her at the
address set forth in such application, such notice to be mailed not less than
five days prior to such hearing. The Board may invite such other persons or
groups as it desires to attend the meeting. The Board shall meet and act with
all reasonable dispatch.
   (g)   In determining whether or not to approve such application, the Board
shall consider whether the proposed change will affect adversely or destroy any
significant historic or architectural feature of the structure, whether it is
inappropriate or inconsistent with the spirit and purpose of this chapter and
whether it will affect adversely or destroy the general historic and
architectural significance of the District. The Board shall also examine any
other considerations specifically listed and adopted by Council. With respect
to any proposed demolition, the Board shall determine whether or not
preservation is economically feasible for the applicant, and shall approve such
application if the denial of such application would result in practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship that would deprive the applicant of the
reasonable use of the land or building involved.
   If, at the next regular meeting of the Board after public hearings, the
Board determines not to approve such application, it shall advise the applicant
of any changes which would secure the approval of the Board and shall withhold
denial of the application for a period not to exceed thirty-one days in order
that the applicant may adopt such proposed changes.
   (h)   After the hearing provided for above, and after the subsequent
alterations, if any, in the plans and/or specifications as provided, the Board
shall submit, in writing, its recommendations to the Building Official, and if
then approved, authorize a permit for the construction, erection, alteration,
removal, moving or demolition. The written report shall include the location of
the proposed work, the exterior changes contemplated, the findings of the Board
and/or the recommendations of the Board as to the grant or refusal of the
application. The Board shall make its report within thirty-one days after the
public hearing; otherwise, the application for the permit shall be deemed to
have been approved, provided, however, that the applicant may waive this
requirement and consent to an extension of such period.
   (i)   Disapproval by the Board of such application may be appealed by the
applicant to the Council of the Village in accordance with Section
1313.12.
   (j)   Conceptual Review. An applicant for a Board approval of a project may
choose, in the applicant's sole discretion, or may be required at the
discretion of the Building Official, to submit a concept plan of the
applicant's proposed project to the Board in lieu of a formal application. The
applicant may do so for the sole purpose of an informal presentation to the
Board and for the Board members' informal review and comment. The concept plan
shall be received by the Building Official at least seven days before the
Board's next meeting. The concept plan need not meet the requirement of the
Village ordinances for an application for the issuance of a building permit.
The Board's review of the concept plan and its members' comments shall not be
binding upon the applicant or upon the Board but are for the sole purpose of
providing suggestions to the applicant prior to the applicant expending
substantial time and expense in developing a final application for submission
to the Board for its final decision regarding approval of the application.
(Ord. 2014-01. Passed 3-11-14.)
   1313.091 DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS.
   The following Design Standards pertain to buildings located within the
Historic District of all materials, construction types, sizes, and occupancy
and encompass the exterior, related landscape features and the building's site
and environment as well as attached, adjacent, or related new construction. The
Design Standards are to be applied to all construction projects in a reasonable
manner, taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility.
   (a)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
   (b)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved
as much as possible. The removal of historic materials or alteration of
features and spaces that characterize a property should be avoided.
   (c)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. New design within the parameters and language of historical
styles is not prohibited, copy-and-paste or reduce-and-enlarge strategies
should be avoided.
   (d)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right should be retained and preserved as
much as reasonably possible.
   (e)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property should be preserved as
much as reasonably possible.
   (f)   Deteriorated historic features should be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials, as close as
possible. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by
documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
   (g)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials should not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, should be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
   (h)   Significant archeological resources affected by a project should be
protected and preserved as much as possible. If such resources must be
disturbed, mitigation measures should be undertaken.
   (i)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
should not destroy the historic materials that characterize the property. The
new work must be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible (bear
striking similarity) with the architectural features, architectural style,
massing, size, and scale to protect the historic integrity of the property and
its environment.
   (j)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction should be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
      (Ord. 2014-01. Passed 3-11-14.)
   1313.092 MAINTENANCE.
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance
or repair of any designated historic property located within the Historic
District, provided such work involves no change in material, design, texture,
color, or exterior appearance; nor shall anything in this chapter be construed
to prevent an change, including the construction, reconstruction, alteration or
demolition of any feature which in the view of the Building Official is
required for the public safety because of an unsafe, insecure or dangerous
conditions.
(Ord. 2014-01. Passed 3-11-14.)
   1313.10  BUILDING PERMIT APPLICATIONS.
       Every building permit application for a structure to be built or
remodeled in the Village shall be made in writing upon printed forms to be
furnished by the Building Official and shall be approved by both the Building
Official and the Board. In order for the application to be approved, the
applicant shall submit to the Building Official two complete sets of drawings
and supplemental specifications, prepared in accordance with good architectural
practice, indicating the building or structure exactly as it is proposed to be
built. Such documents, accurately drawn to scale and dimension, shall include
and conform to the following requirements:
   (a)   There shall be a site plan or plot plan, accurately drawn to the scale
of one inch equaling thirty feet (1"=30'-0"), showing the plot configuration
and its perimeter dimensions, all structures on the site with locating
dimensions, the location of all structures adjacent to the site within fifty
feet of the property line, and all vehicular drives, roads, related parking
areas, main walks, walls, fences, major existing landscaping, and erosion and
drainage control. In addition, locations and names of adjacent streets, a north
arrow, the first floor level and existing and finished grade elevations at each
corner of new constructions and at each corner of the site shall be indicated.
   (b)   Four elevations shall be shown, including a front, rear and two side
elevations, together with additional view or cross-sections, if necessary, to
completely indicate the exterior appearance of the structures. All elevations
shall be drawn to the same scale, which shall be not less than one-quarter of
an inch to the foot, and details shall be three-quarters of an inch or one and
one-half inch to the foot. Each elevation shall show the accurate location of
windows, doors, shutters, chimneys, porches and other architectural features,
all materials and finishes, all plumbing fixtures, sewer and drain piping, all
electric outlets and their control, and an accurate finish grade line.
   (c)   There shall be a completely dimensioned floor plan of each level of
the construction, drawn to the scale of one quarter of an inch to the foot (¼"

can be seen shall be included.
   (g)   A topographic survey, in the form set forth in Section
1315.04, shall be included, and the same shall contain all information shown on
such form. If the Building Official, after consultation with the Architectural
Board of Review, shall determine that further study is desirable with respect
to soil conditions, subsurface water conditions, surface drainage, flood plain
elevations, construction or other conditions where engineering advice should be
obtained, the applicant shall pay to the Village that sum required to cover the
fees and expenses of the Village Engineer and any related fees for outside
services pertaining thereto. No building permit shall be issued until such
topographic survey has been first approved by the Village Engineer. No
construction, erection or moving of any building, or addition thereto, shall
proceed after the footers are in place, until the Building Official has
approved the grade. The Building Official may waive the requirement of a
topographic survey where the remodeling, alteration or addition will be
constructed in conformity with the established grade.
   (h)   There shall be a detailed landscape plan accurately drawn to a scale
not less than one inch equaling twenty feet (1" = 20' - 0') and shall include

dollars ($3,000), or which will have a value when completed of more than three
thousand dollars ($3,000), shall be built according to plans and specifications
prepared by an architect registered for the practice of architecture in the
State at the time the plans are submitted to the Building Official. All plans
and specifications submitted for approval shall be signed or sealed by a
registered architect. In the event that a building or structure costing or
having a value when completed of less than three thousand dollars ($3,000) is
unusually complex or of such a nature as to require exceptional ability in its
design, such building or structure shall also be designed by a registered
architect.
   (b)   All plans and specifications required to be prepared by a registered
architect and submitted to the Building Official for his or her approval shall
be accompanied by a certificate of a registered architect stating for whom the
plans and specifications were prepared, the location at which the building or
structure is to be constructed, the date of the plans and specifications and a
statement attesting to the fact that they were prepared by such registered
architect personally or by employees in his or her office or organization under
his or her personal supervision.
   (c)   When requested by official action of the Architectural Board of
Review, the Building Official is hereby authorized and directed to employ a
qualified, licensed architect to consult with and assist the Board on any and
all matters set forth in this chapter. If the Historic District and/or historic
landmarks are involved, such architect shall be a qualified restoration
architect. Such consultation and assistance shall be strictly advisory and the
Board will not be bound by the architect's recommendations or opinion.
(Ord. 2014-01. Passed 3-11-14.)
   1313.12  APPEALS.
    An appeal to the Council of the Village may be taken by any person
aggrieved, or by any officer of the Village affected, by any decision of the
Architectural Board of Review. Such appeal shall be taken within twenty days
after the decision has been filed with the Building Official, by filing with
the Building Official and with the Clerk of Council a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds therefor. The Building Official shall forthwith transmit
to the Council all papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed was taken. The authority, duties and proceedings of Council shall be
such as are prescribed in Sections
1367.11(b) through (e).

   1313.13  INTERPRETATION.
     Unless otherwise specifically stated herein, it is not intended that this
chapter repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way impair or interfere with any
existing provision of law or ordinance or any rule or regulation previously
adopted or issued or which shall be adopted or issued pursuant to the law
relating to the use of buildings or premises, provided, however, that where
this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or
premises than is imposed or required by such regulations, this chapter shall
control. This chapter is to be construed liberally to secure the beneficial
interests and purposes thereof.

SUBJECT TO OBBC.
   (a)   Before proceeding with the construction, alteration, repair, removal
or demolition of any building or other structure, a permit shall be obtained
from the Building Official.
   (b)   No Village permit shall be issued with respect to a building or
structure subject to the Ohio Building Code until a State approved set of final
plans and specifications and a copy of the State permit issued with respect
thereto have been submitted to the Building Official and reviewed by the
Architectural Board of Review in conjunction with its review of those aspects
of the location and construction of such building or structure which are
subject to this Building and Housing Code. All inspections of construction
pursuant to the State approved plans and specifications shall be conducted by
State authorized and approved inspectors. Architectural Board of Review
approvals and the Village permit shall indicate that they are limited to those
matters subject to these Codified Ordinances. The fee for such limited permit
shall be one-half of the usual fee provided in Section
1315.10.
(Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1315.02 APPROVAL OF SEWAGE FACILITY BY HEALTH BOARD OR OEPA.
   The Building Official is hereby ordered to require all applicants for
permits to construct or alter a dwelling within the Village, to secure the
approval of the Cuyahoga County Board of Health or the State Environmental
Protection Agency, as may be required, of all plans and specifications for the
sewage treatment plant to be constructed for use in connection with the
occupancy of such dwelling. Until such approval is secured by such applicant,
the Building Official shall refuse to issue a permit to construct or alter a
dwelling within the Village. However, should such application be for a permit
to alter a dwelling upon a parcel of land where a sewage treatment plant has
already been constructed, and such plant has adequately disposed of the sewage
from such dwelling, such approval shall not be required.
(Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1315.03  CONSTRUCTION GUARANTEE DEPOSIT; COMPLETION OF WORK AND INSPECTION.
   (a)   Before the owner or his or her agent shall construct an improvement on
any property within the Village, and at the time of securing a permit for the
construction, enlargement, alteration, repair or removal of any building or
other structure, the owner or his or her agent shall deposit with the Clerk an
amount equal to one dollar ($1.00) per square foot of the building or other
structure proposed to be constructed, but not less than one hundred dollars
($100.00), as the Building Official shall determine to be sufficient to
guarantee:
      (1)   That any damage to the streets, sidewalks, curbing, tree lawns or
berms within the Village shall be repaired and restored to their original
condition at the cost and expense of the owner;
      (2)   That the work for which the permit was issued shall be completed in
accordance with the approved plans and specifications; and
      (3)   That the information required by the permit application and CCA
Form 120-71, or equivalent, has been fully and correctly provided.
   (b)   Upon the failure of the owner or his or her agent to replace or
restore such streets, sidewalks, curbing, tree lawns or berms to their original
condition upon the completion of the work for which the permit was issued and
the deposit made to the satisfaction of the Building Official, the Building
Official shall have such work performed and shall pay the cost and expense
thereof out of the fund so deposited, and in the event the deposited sum shall
not be sufficient to pay such cost and expense, the owner shall be liable to
the Village for any balance.
   (c)   Upon completion of the work for which the permit was issued and the
deposit made, the owner or his or her agent shall request the Building Official
to make an inspection for the purpose of determining what refund, if any,
should be made from the deposit. Twenty-five dollars ($25.00) of the deposit
shall be retained by the Village to cover the cost of each such inspection.
After charges for such work by the Village and the cost of inspection have been
deducted from the deposit, the balance shall be refunded to the owner if the
requirements of paragraph (a)(3) hereof have been met.
   (d)   If the work contemplated by the aforesaid permit has not been
completed at the expiration of two years from the date of making such deposit,
or if the necessary repairs or restoration to the streets, sidewalks, curbing,
tree lawns or berms have not been made as required hereunder, such deposit or
any portion thereof then remaining shall be forfeited to the Village.
(Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1315.04 TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEY.
   Each application for preliminary approval of building plans shall be
accompanied by a topographic survey, as set forth below, and shall contain all
information shown on such form. If the Building Official, after consultation
with the Architectural Board of Review, shall determine that further study is
desirable with respect to soil conditions, subsurface water conditions, surface
drainage, flood plain elevations, construction or other conditions where
engineering advice should be obtained, the applicant shall pay to the Village
that sum required to cover the fees and expenses of the Village Engineer and
any related fees for outside services pertaining thereto. No building permit
shall be issued until such topographic survey has first been approved by the
Village Engineer. No construction, erection, addition to or moving of any
building shall proceed after the footers are in place, until the Building
Official has approved the grade. The Building Official may waive the
requirement of a topographic survey where the remodeling, alteration or
addition will be constructed in conformity with the established grade.

   (a)   When specifications and drawings submitted pursuant to this chapter
shall be found to conform to the requirements of this Building and Housing
Code, the Building Official shall issue a permit and affix to the
specifications and drawings his or her official stamp, stating that examination
has been made and the permit issued. One copy of such stamped specifications
and plans shall be returned to the applicants and shall be continuously kept at
the site of the proposed work throughout its construction period. The second
copy shall be filed with the permanent records of the Building Official. The
stamping of any specification or drawing shall not be held to permit or be an
approval of any violation of any section of this Building and Housing Code, nor
shall the issuance of any permit for a part of a structure be held to imply or
require the approval of any remaining part of such structure for which complete
specifications and drawings were not submitted at the time of issuance of the
permit for a part of the structure.
   (b)   Any permit so issued shall become invalid as required by 105.3 of the
Residential Code of Ohio.
   (c)   Upon issuing a building permit, the Building Official shall fix the
reasonable time necessary to complete the work authorized by the permit, taking
into consideration the time for completion as estimated by the applicant, the
nature of the work and the effect of seasonal and weather conditions, and shall
note the completion date on the building permit.
   (d)   Upon completion of the building work authorized by the permit in
accordance with the plans, specifications and drawings, the owner, builder or
his or her representative shall request a final inspection by the Building
Official. No building shall be used or occupied until its completion in
accordance with the plans, specifications and drawings has been approved by the
Building Official. Upon application and for good cause shown, the Building
Official may extend the completion date for delays caused by conditions beyond
the control of the owner or builder, or for other good and sufficient reasons.
   (e)   Within six months from the date originally fixed by the Building
Official for the completion of the work authorized by the permit, the property
upon which the building is located shall be finish graded and seeded or sodded
with quality grass, seed or sod or planted with other ground covering in

building permit and shall be continuously maintained thereafter.
   (f)   Failure to complete the work authorized by the permit or failure to
grade and seed or sod the property as required by the provisions of this
section shall constitute a violation of this section. (Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-
8-14.)
   1315.06 DENIAL OF PERMITS FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.
   If the information contained in any application for a permit, or in
specifications or drawings accompanying such application, indicates that the
work to be done is not clearly and specifically defined, is imperfect or is not
in all respects in accordance with the provisions of this Building and Housing
Code or other applicable law, ordinance or regulation, the Building Official
shall not issue a permit until the deficiencies or violations shall have been
in all respects corrected.
(Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1315.07 ALTERATION OF APPLICATIONS.

has been stamped by the Building Official. (Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1315.08 DEVIATIONS FROM APPLICATION, SPECIFICATIONS OR DRAWINGS.
   No person shall do or cause to be done anything which shall cause any change
or deviation from the terms of an application, specifications or drawings, in
any manner affecting the structural features or the stability of the structure,
unless the permission of the Building Official shall, prior to the commencement
of such change or deviation, have been asked for and granted, both in writing.
(Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1315.09 WHEN PERMIT NOT REQUIRED.
   No permit shall be required for minor interior or exterior repairs, nor for
alterations to or within structures, which alterations do not involve any
change in structural parts, stairways, chimneys, heating apparatus, means of
ingress or egress, light or ventilation.
(Ord. 638. Passed 11-14-46.)
   1315.10  PERMIT FEE; FEES FOR PLAN REVIEW AND INSPECTIONS.

   1341.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization . Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Village Council of Gates Mills, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of Gates Mills has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;

   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Gates Mills as identified in Section
1341.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
Village of Gates Mills.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.
      (1)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and /
or maps are adopted:
         A.   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
both effective December 3, 2010.
         B.   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
         C.   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Gates Mills as required by Section
1341.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
      (2)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.
Such maps and/or studies are on file at the Village Hall at 1470 Chagrin River
Road, Gates Mills, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,

state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Gates Mills, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 2010-26. Passed 9-14-10.)
 
   1341.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).

equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:     Special flood hazard areas inundated
by the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):  The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:  
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).
   A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).
   A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes,
shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway
delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a
determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by
fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the
special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).
   A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project
complies with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain
management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Gates Mills
Flood Insurance Rate Map, April 3, 1978, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 2010-26. Passed 9-14-10.)

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section

            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (i)(1) A
hereof.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Village of
Gates Mills, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Gates Mills have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Gates Mills Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the
Village of Gates Mills boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a
map of the Village of Gates Mills suitable for reproduction, clearly showing
the new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Gates Mills
has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1341.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.    
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1341.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Gates Mills and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Gates Mills specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1341.03(j)(1)A.3.when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 2010-26. Passed 9-14-10.)
   1341.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Village of Gates Mills Planning Commission is hereby appointed
to serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by Village
Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in Village
Hall at 1470 Chagrin River Road, Gates Mills, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 10 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the Village of Gates
Mills.
      (2)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2)A. to K. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 2010-26. Passed 9-14-
10.)

(Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1353.04  MOVING UNFIT BUILDINGS.
   No permit shall be issued to move any building which, in the opinion of the
Building Official, is so constructed or is in such condition as to be
dangerous, is infected with pests or is unsanitary; or if it is a dwelling unit
for human habitation, in a dilapidated condition, defective or in such a
condition of deterioration or disrepair that its relocation at the proposed
site would cause appreciable harm to, or be materially detrimental to, other
property or improvements in the Village; or if the building is of a type
prohibited at the proposed location by any statute of the State or ordinance of
the Village; or if the use of the building at the new location is in violation
of the statutes of the State or the ordinances of the Village; or if the moving
of the building would cause unreasonable damage to the trees, plants, shrubs or
utility poles on or along the public streets. However, if the condition of the
building, in the opinion of the Building Official, is capable of practicable
and effective repair, the permit may be issued upon the terms and conditions
hereinafter set forth.
(Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1353.05 SCOPE OF PERMITS.
   Issuance of a permit to an applicant shall not be construed as approval by
the Village of any violation of a State statute or Village ordinance.
(Ord. 1178. Passed 10-9-61.)
   1353.06 PERMIT CONDITIONS.
   A house moving permit shall be granted only after the applicant accepts and

removing or replanting trees or shrubs and of moving, removing or displacing
any poles or other structures supporting any wires, cables or other equipment
upon such poles or structures belonging to the Village. The cost thereof shall
be estimated by the Building Official, and his or her determination shall be
final.
   (c)   The applicant must have procured, in writing, the permission of the
owners of any trees, shrubs, fences, poles, wires, cables or any other physical
structures which must be moved, removed or displaced in order to allow passage
of the building, to move, remove or displace the same. The permit to move such
building will not be issued until such time as such written permissions are
filed with the Clerk.
   (d)   The applicant must deposit with the Clerk a sufficient sum to be used
to pay the overtime wages of any policemen which the Chief of Police determines
are necessary to employ in order to direct traffic and warn pedestrians and
motorists of the obstruction of a building in the process of being moved over
and upon public streets.
   (e)   The applicant shall file with the Clerk a liability insurance policy
issued by a solvent insurance company authorized to do business in the State,
which policy shall conform in all respects to the requirements of this chapter.
However, in lieu of filing such insurance policy, a certificate must show that
a policy meeting the requirements of this section has been issued, and shall
set forth its expiration date.

utility companies affected by the move. Any response or special condition
requirements by the utility company shall also be submitted to the Building
Official.
      (Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1353.07  LIABILITY INSURANCE; AMOUNTS.
   The liability policy required under this chapter shall insure the person,
partnership, corporation or other organization moving a building against loss
from liability imposed by law for injury or death to any person, and for injury
to the property of any person, including the Village, that occurs while the
mover of a building is so engaged upon the streets of the Village. Such policy
shall insure the mover in the amounts set forth hereinafter, exclusive of
interest and costs:
   (a)   For injury to, or for the death of, any one person, five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000);
   (b)   For injuries to, or for the deaths of, or for any combination of

the Chief of Police that all requirements of their offices have been met.
(Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)

not less than thirty-six hours nor more than forty-eight hours before the
actual work of moving a building or structure is to commence. (Ord. 2014-03.
Passed 4-8-14.)
   1353.10  NONCOMPLIANCE; NOTICE TO PERFORM; PERFORMANCE BY VILLAGE.
   (a)   Whenever a default has occurred in the performance of any term or
condition of any permit, written notice thereof shall be given to the permittee
by the Building Official. Such notice shall state the work to be done, the
estimated cost thereof and the period of time deemed to be reasonably necessary
to complete such work.
   (b)   After receipt of such notice, the permittee must, within the time
therein specified, either cause the work to be done or pay over to the Clerk
the estimated cost of doing such work as set forth in the notice, plus ten
percent thereof. Upon receipt of notice from the Clerk that the permittee has
deposited such money, the Building Official shall cause the required work to be
performed and completed. If the permittee defaults and fails to complete the
moving of the building, the Village shall have the option, in lieu of
completing the work required, to demolish the building and to clear, clean and
restore the site or sites.
(Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1353.11  APPROVAL OF STREETS; MOVING EQUIPMENT.
   The streets over which any building is to be moved must be approved by the
Building Official and the Chief of Police. All equipment for moving buildings,
except that provided with rubber treads, shall be provided with means to
prevent the picking up of asphalt from the pavement. Such means may include
automatic or manual application of a suitable solvent, but only to the extent
that no excess is left on the pavement. Such means shall be used whenever
necessary, in the opinion of the Building Official, to prevent damage to
pavements. If he or she shall find that such means are not in use when
necessary, or are ineffective, he or she shall immediately order the work
stopped until the necessary precautions are taken to prevent damage.
(Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1353.12  FOUNDATION REQUIRED.
   No person, either as the mover or the one causing the moving to be done, as
the owner of the real property, or as the owner of a building, shall permit any
building which has been moved to be placed upon any real property within the
Village unless a suitable foundation has already been erected and is ready for
the building to be placed and anchored upon such foundation.
(Ord. 1178. Passed 10-9-61.)
   1353.13  BARRICADES AND WARNING LIGHTS.
   The person having charge of the moving of any building shall maintain at all
times proper flags, lights, barricades and other danger signals, whenever such
building is on any public street. (Ord. 1178. Passed 10-9-61.)
   1353.14  DAMAGE TO PUBLIC PROPERTY; REMEDIES OF VILLAGE.
   In the event that the moving of any building for which a permit shall have
been granted under this chapter causes damage to the public streets or other
public property and improvements, the Building Official, in addition to any
other remedy the Village may have, may cause such damage to be repaired, and
the costs thereof shall be deducted from the deposit required by Section
1353.06(b), or the Building Official may require the person to whom such a
permit has been granted, or his or her authorized representative, upon written
notification from the Building Official, to make all necessary repairs to such
streets, property and improvements. However, should such person to whom such
permit has been granted and to whom such notice has been given, or his or her
authorized representative, fail to make such necessary repairs within the
period of time designated in such written notice, the Building Official may
cause such necessary repairs to be made and the costs thereof deducted from the
deposit required by Section
 1353.06(b), or may proceed to exercise any other remedies which the Village
may have.
(Ord. 2014-03. Passed 4-8-14.)
   1353.15  COMPLETION OF WORK; REFUND OF DEPOSIT; LIABILITY FOR EXCESS COSTS.
   When the moving of any building for which a permit has been granted is
completed and all damage to public streets or other public property has been
repaired, and the cost of repairing the damage and of performing other work as
provided for in this chapter shall have been paid out of the deposit required
by Section
1353.06(b), such portion of the deposit then remaining unused under the
provisions of this chapter shall be refunded, upon the surrender of the deposit
receipt. Should the cost, however, of repairing the aforesaid damage or
performing other work exceed the total amount of money deposited, the person to
whom such permit was granted shall be liable for the amount of damages or other
costs which are in excess of the amount deposited.
(Ord. 2021. Passed 8-10-81.)
   1353.16 PERMIT REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION; APPEAL.
   (a)   The Building Official or the Chief of Police may at any time, for
sufficient cause, revoke or suspend any permit granted under this chapter. Any
person excepting to any denial, suspension or revocation of a permit applied
for or held by him or her pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, or to any
other action taken by any official of the Village concerning such permit, may
appeal in writing to Council by filing with the Clerk a written notice of such
appeal, setting forth the specific grounds thereof.
   (b)   Such notice must be filed within fourteen days after notice of the
action appealed from is received by the appellant, but in no event later than
thirty days after date of such action. The Clerk shall set the matter for
hearing before Council at the next Council meeting and cause notice thereof to
be given to the appellant not less than five days prior thereto. At such
hearing the appellant must show cause, on the grounds specified in the notice
of appeal, why the action excepted to should not be approved. Council may
continue such hearing from time to time, and its findings on the appeal shall
be final and conclusive in the matter, subject to the provisions of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 2506.

parking facilities accessory to such use as hereinafter required. No permit for
such construction or alteration shall be issued unless and until such accessory
off-street parking facilities shall be so provided for.
(Ord. 1081. Passed 6-30-59.)

condition precedent to the occupancy and use of such building or structure, as
follows:
   (a)   Whenever a building or structure is constructed or a new use
established, facilities shall be provided as to the new structure and to the
extent of the new use provided on the same lot or on an adjoining lot under the
same ownership; or
   (b)   Whenever the use of an existing building or structure is changed to a
use requiring more parking facilities, or whenever an existing building is
altered and there is an increase in the seating capacity or floor areas of the
building or structure, facilities shall be provided for the additional building
or alteration on the same lot or on an adjoining lot under the same ownership.
(Ord. 1081. Passed 6-30-59.)
   1355.04  MAINTENANCE OF FACILITIES.
   All accessory off-street parking facilities shall continue unobstructed in
operation, shall not be used for automobile service or repair and shall not be
reduced below the required size as long as the main use remains, unless an
equivalent number of facilities is provided for such use in another approved
location.
(Ord. 1081. Passed 6-30-59.)

Eating places, bars, taverns     space per each 2 seats, whichever requires
                                 the greater number of spaces.
Public buildings, municipal and  1 space for each full-time employee, plus 1
educational                      space for each 6 seats in assembly rooms.
   (b)   These minimum requirements are also the maximum requirements, unless
the applicant shows extraordinary circumstances that necessitate additional
parking beyond these maximums.
   (c)   Location of Required Parking Spaces.
Off-Street Parking. Required off-street parking spaces for any use shall be
located on the same parcel as the use they are intended to serve, except where
these regulations allow shared parking between uses on different lots pursuant
to subsection (d) below.
   (d)   Joint or Collective Parking Facilities. Shared parking facilities are
strongly encouraged and are permitted if multiple uses cooperatively establish
and operate the facilities and if these uses generate parking demands primarily
during hours when the remaining uses are not in operations. (For example, if
one use operates during evenings or week days only.) The applicant shall have
the burden of proof for a reduction in the total number of required off-street
parking spaces, and documentation shall be submitted substantiating their
reasons for the requested parking reduction. Shared parking may be approved if:
      (1)   A sufficient number of spaces are provided to meet the highest
demand of the participating uses;
      (2)   Evidence to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission has been
submitted by the parties operating the shared parking facility, describing the
nature of the uses, the times when the uses operate so as to demonstrate the
lack of potential conflict between them and compliance with handicapped parking
requirements; and
      (3)   Additional documents, covenants, deed restrictions or other
agreements as may be deemed necessary by the Planning Commission are executed
to assure that the required parking spaces provided are maintained and uses
with similar hours and parking requirements as those uses sharing the parking
facilities remain for the life of the development.
         (Ord. 2005-20. Passed 7-12-05.)
 
   1355.06  SURFACE IMPROVEMENT OF FACILITIES.
   Accessory off-street parking facilities and access driveways shall have a
concrete, asphalt or other hard surface and shall provide adequate drainage so
that all water is drained within the lot on which the parking area or driveway
is located in such manner that water shall not drain across other public or
private property. Appropriate bumper guards or concrete or stone curbs shall be
provided in order to define parking space or limits of paved areas and to
prevent vehicles from projecting into the required yards. (Ord. 1081. Passed 6-
30-59.)
   1355.07 APPROVAL BY ARCHITECTURAL BOARD OF REVIEW REQUIRED.
   Detailed drawings of accessory off-street parking facilities, including
access driveways, shall be submitted for approval by the Architectural Board of
Review before an application for a building permit is approved. Such drawings
shall set forth and show the number of parking spaces and locations, dimensions
and descriptions of all features enumerated and required by this chapter.

   (a)   No vehicle shall be stored upon any premises in a residential use
district within the Village except passenger automobiles, except that private
mobile recreational facilities, including motor vehicles, boats and
recreational trailers used solely for recreational purposes by the residents of
the premises, and small panel or pick-up trucks, may be stored on the premises
in a garage building or outside if adequately screened, but the same shall not

   1361.02 STORAGE AND SCREENING OF ANTENNAS.
   (a)   No ground-based antenna shall be installed or maintained within the

and other structures, provided that no such antenna shall be erected within
forty feet of any lot line;
      (2)   The size and shape of the antenna and its mounting, provided that
the maximum diameter of such antenna shall not exceed twelve feet;
      (3)   The view of the screened area from the street and from adjoining

      (4)   The size, quantity and quality of screening. Adequate screening may
consist of walls, fencing or plantings, which shall be continuously maintained,
as approved by the Board.
   (b)   No roof-mounted antenna which is five feet or greater in height or
diameter shall be erected on the rooftop of any building unless such
installation has been approved by the Board based upon the following factors:

government's interest in providing for and spurring competition in the
telecommunications arena. All legislation is directed at creating an
environment where residents will have the greatest opportunity to benefit from
the intent of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, to enhance competition while
impacting the Village's land use plan and its property values in the least
intrusive manner possible.

property owner in the Village whom he or she feels will be substantially
impacted by the siting of this tower. The failure of the Building Official to
give notice as required in this section shall not affect the validity of the
Planning Commission's action. The foregoing notice requirement may be waived by
the Planning Commission for construction of a new antenna on an existing
structure, which application does not require the construction of a new tower
or associated facilities.
 
   (e)   After conducting its meeting, the Planning Commission may act upon the
application. Any decision to deny a request to place, construct or modify a
wireless communication antenna and/or tower shall be in writing and shall be
supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record of the
proceedings of the Planning Commission.
 
   (f)   Approval by the Planning Commission of the granting of a permit shall
become effective only following review and approval by the Village Council. A
certified copy of a resolution of the Planning Commission granting such permit
shall be filed forthwith by the Secretary of the Planning Commission with the
Clerk of Council. Within the thirty-day period next succeeding such filing,
Council, by a majority vote, must approve, disapprove or approve with
modification the Planning Commission's action in granting the permit. Any
decision to deny a permit to place, construct or modify a wireless
communication antenna and/or tower shall be in writing and supported by
substantial evidence contained in a written record of the proceedings of
Council.
 
   (g)   After approval by Council, any plans for equipment buildings and
accessory structures shall be submitted to the Architectural Board of Review
for review and approval under Chapter
1313 of the Building Code.
 
   (h)   After approval by the Architectural Board of Review, the Building
Official is authorized to issue a permit in accordance with all prior
approvals.

      (Ord. 2802. Passed 4-8-97.)
   1373.05 LOCATION; STANDARDS.
   Only monopole wireless communication towers and their associated supporting
buildings shall be allowed in the Village. All monopole wireless communication
towers shall meet the following criteria:
   (a)   No new wireless communication facility may be erected if there is a
technically suitable space for a wireless communication facility available on
an existing wireless communication tower within the applicant's search area in
which the new wireless communication antenna is to be located. With the permit
application, the applicant shall list the location of every tower, building or
structure that could support the proposed antenna so as to allow it to serve
its intended function. The applicant must demonstrate that a technically
suitable location is not reasonably available on an existing tower, building or
structure. If another communication tower is technically suitable, the
applicant must show that it has requested to co-locate on the existing tower
and the co-location request was rejected by the owner of the tower. In all
circumstances, owners of existing towers shall promptly respond to requests for
co-location, but in no event shall they respond in more than thirty days from
the date of receipt of written request for co-location. If another
communication tower is technically suitable, the applicant must further show
that it has offered to allow the owner of that other tower to co-locate an
antenna on another tower within the Village owned by the applicant on
reciprocal terms and the offer was not accepted. In all cases, the Village
shall use its best efforts to encourage co-location.
   (b)   As a condition of issuing a permit to construct and operate a tower in
the Village, the owner/operator of the tower is required to allow co-location
until said tower has reached full antenna capacity, but in no event fewer than
two additional antennas for two additional providers. Agreement to this
provision must be included in the lease by the landowner, if different from the
owner/operator of the tower. Written documentation must be presented to the
Planning Commission and Council evidencing that the landowner of the property
on which the tower is to be located has agreed to the terms of this section as
well as the requirements, regulations and standards established in this
chapter. As an additional condition of issuing the permit to construct and
operate the tower in the Village, the owner/operator of the tower is required
to sign a statement that all disputes with future providers concerning co-
location and the terms and conditions of co-location shall be submitted to
commercial arbitration under a system selected by the parties, but if the
parties are unable to agree, then under the auspices of the Commercial
Arbitration Provisions of the American Arbitration Association.
   (c)   The minimum lot size for which a wireless communication tower is to be
located shall be the minimum lot size for a residential district, unless a
variance is granted, and shall be of sufficient size to contain on-site any
debris from tower collapse.
   (d)   No new wireless communication tower will be allowed within a 2,500-
foot radius of an existing cellular tower. The Planning Commission may waive
this requirement with the approval of Council for the purpose of clustering of
towers so long as the towers are visually compatible with the surrounding
neighborhood.
   (e)   A wireless communication antenna may be affixed to existing structures
so long as it complies with Village zoning regulations.
      (Ord. 2802. Passed 4-8-97.)
 
   1373.06  PERMITTED HEIGHT.
   Wireless communication towers may not be erected to a height in excess of
150 feet above ground level. Should the applicant wish to erect a wireless
communication tower in excess of 150 feet, it must seek a variance from the
Planning Commission. In no event, however, shall the Planning Commission have
any authority to grant a variance for a wireless communication tower in excess
of 200 feet.
(Ord. 2802. Passed 4-8-97.)
   1373.07  STRENGTH.
   Towers and antennas shall be designed to withstand sustained winds of at
least eighty miles per hour with one-half inch of icing. An applicant shall
further be required to construct or locate on a base the tower structure and
the structure foundation, which base is designed to be buildable up to, but not
including, the maximum permitted height for that structure. Such structure
shall further be designed to have sufficient structural capacity to allow for
at least three providers to be located on the structure when constructed to the
maximum allowable height. The wireless communication facility shall also be
designed to show that the applicant has enough space on its site for an
equipment building large enough to accommodate at least three providers. If the
equipment building is initially constructed to accommodate only one user, space
shall be reserved on-site for equipment building expansion to accommodate up to
at least two additional providers. The maximum size of above-ground equipment
buildings is 300 square feet for one provider and in no circumstances more than
750 square feet total. (Ord. 2802. Passed 4-8-97.)
   1373.08  SETBACK.
   (a)   The wireless communication tower must be set back from all property
lines by a distance of fifty percent of the height of the tower (unless a
larger distance is required by Section
1373.05(c)) or by the rear yard or side yard setback required in the underlying
zoning district, whichever is greater.
 
   (b)   All associated equipment support buildings must meet the minimum
setback standards for accessory structures in the underlying zoning district
and shall not be used for offices, long-term vehicle storage or outdoor
storage.
 
   (c)   In no case shall the wireless communication facility be located in the
required front yard of a lot.
(Ord. 2802. Passed 4-8-97.)
   1373.09 GENERAL DESIGN STANDARDS; LANDSCAPE BUFFERS; FENCES.
   (a)   General Design Standards.
      (1)   The entire facility must be aesthetically and architecturally
compatible with the environment. The use of residentially compatible exterior
materials, such as wood, brick or stucco, is required for associated equipment
buildings, which shall be designed to architecturally match the exterior of
residential structures within the neighborhood. In no case will metal or
concrete block exteriors be allowed for accessory buildings.
      (2)   The tower itself must be of such design and treated with an
architectural material so that it is camouflaged or blends in with surrounding
uses so as to be visually compatible with the neighborhood.
   (b)   Landscape Buffers. Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved to
the maximum extent practical. All towers shall be landscaped with at least one
row of evergreen shrubs or trees within twenty feet of the tower's base. Such
trees shall be a minimum of six feet high when planted and spaced not more than
ten feet apart. These trees and shrubs shall be planted in any configuration
which will serve to better buffer the site.
   (c)   Fences. Fences constructed of wood, brick or chain link shall be used
to secure the site and provide an opaque barrier. Such fences shall be used in
conjunction with landscaping to provide security or increase the buffer with
the adjacent residential uses. In no case will barbwire or razorwire fencing be
permitted in residential districts. (Ord. 2802. Passed 4-8-97.)
 
   1373.10  VISUAL IMPACT MITIGATION.
   (a)   Color. The wireless communication tower will be constructed of a
material with a neutral color and shall be designed to blend with the
surrounding landscape and uses.
 
   (b)   Light. No exterior lighting of the wireless communication tower is
permitted.    
 
   (c)   Design. The design criteria for wireless communication towers and
their associated support buildings shall follow the provisions outlined above
in Section
1373.09.   
(Ord. 2802. Passed 4-8-97.)
 
   1373.11 PARKING.
   At least one off-street parking space shall be provided, for each provider,
for towers which are located in residential districts. (Ord. 2802. Passed 4-8-
97.)
   1373.12  TIME LIMIT ON PROJECT COMPLETION.
   Once a wireless communication tower is approved, the building permit shall
be obtained within six months and the project shall be completed within one
year.    
   All obsolete or unused facilities abandoned for six consecutive months must
be removed within twelve months of cessation of operation at the site.
(Ord. 2802. Passed 4-8-97.)
   1373.13  FEES.
   Before an action shall be taken regarding the application for a wireless
communication facility, the applicant shall deposit with the Planning and
Zoning Commission a fee in the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) to
supplement the cost of processing the application.
   The applicant shall also place on deposit the amount necessary, but not less
than two thousand, five hundred dollars ($2,500), for the Village to obtain a
certification from a registered engineer that the proposal is in compliance
with Federal, State and local regulations. (Ord. 2802. Passed 4-8-97.)

   1513.01  INTENT.
   It is the intent of Council to ensure the safe operation of oil and gas
wells within the Municipality. Toward that end, this chapter has been adopted
to supplement any state issued permits which authorize the drilling of an oil
and gas well within the Municipality. The provisions of this chapter are based
upon local conditions which may not have been known to the state at the time
such drilling was authorized. It is, further, the intent of the Municipality to
exercise its local police authority, authorized under Article XVIII, Section 3
of the Ohio Constitution, to the fullest extent permitted by law for the
protection of the Municipality’s residents and all emergency personnel who may
be called upon to respond to an incident at an oil and gas well.
(Ord. 2006-07. Passed 2-14-06.)
   1513.02 INTERPRETATION.
   If any provision of this chapter is deemed to conflict with any
constitutional general law of the State of Ohio, the general law shall prevail.
In the event the general law of the State is silent as to any substantive
regulation contained herein, the substantive regulation established by this
chapter shall be applicable.
(Ord. 2006-07. Passed 2-14-06.)
   1513.03 MUNICIPAL REGULATIONS.
   Any person who has a permit to drill for oil and gas within the Village of
Gates Mills which has been issued by any Department of the State of Ohio
(“Permit Holder”) shall adhere to the following regulations:
   (a)   A copy of the state issued permit shall be filed by the Permit Holder
with the Fire Chief and Building Official not less than fourteen (14) days
before the commencement of any operations preparatory to drilling in the
Village. A copy of such permit shall also be delivered to all owners and/or
occupants of all properties which adjoin the property where a well is to be
drilled, with proof and date of such delivery furnished to the Fire Chief and
Building Official by the Permit Holder not less than fourteen (14) days before
commencement of any operations preparatory to drilling in the Village. The
Permit Holder shall check with the Building Official prior to delivery to
adjacent property owners/occupants to obtain information of the Village as to
the identity of the individuals to receive the notice and permit.
   (b)   With a copy of the permit, a letter will be filed with the Fire Chief
which identifies the owner(s) of the subject property where the well is to be
drilled by name and address, and identifies all persons, including but not
limited to the Permit Holder, who are responsible for the drilling and
operation of the well. The identification shall include, at a minimum, names,
addresses and work telephone numbers which shall be valid twenty-four (24)
hours a day.
   (c)   Plans for all wells, tank batteries (including tank dimensions and gas
meter types), all excavation work (including but not limited to boring pits),
fencing heights and type and site landscaping plans shall be presented to the
Fire Chief not less than fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of any
drilling or other operations. These plans shall show the topography of the site
and of all vehicular access to the site from any public right-of-way.
   (d)   Plans showing all buildings on the subject premises, and all buildings
within five hundred (500) feet of the well and tank sites, shall be provided.
   (e)   No well may be drilled, or tank batteries located, in any location
where emergency vehicles (e.g., fire trucks and ambulances) cannot obtain
reasonable access to the site.
   (f)   No well is allowed to be drilled within any distance of any structure
or facility (e.g., playground) which, based upon the specific facts and
circumstances surrounding such structure or facility, creates a threat to the
health, safety and welfare of said structure or facilities or occupants or
users thereof.
   (g)   Proof of insurance shall be filed with the Fire Chief, prior to the
commencement of drilling. The proof of insurance must establish that the Permit
Holder is insured by a solvent insurer, licensed to do business in the State of
Ohio, with limits of $3,000,000.00 per occurrence for personal injury and
property damage. The amount of such insurance shall be reviewed by the Village
every five (5) years and may be adjusted based on inflationary increases. The
Village shall be an additional named insured on the insurance policy.
   (h)   Emergency contact information for all persons engaged in drilling and
operating the well shall be filed with the Fire Chief prior to the commencement
of drilling. Such information shall be immediately updated upon any change of
circumstance.
   (i)   Within thirty (30) days after drilling operations have been completed,
the Permit Holder shall do all of the following:
      (1)   Fill all bore pits with clean fill dirt, and restore the grade of
the site to its previous elevation;
      (2)   Seed all disturbed sites with grass or other vegetative ground
cover, and ensure such ground cover becomes established; and
      (3)   Notify the Building Official that the site has been restored
pursuant to the terms of this paragraph. The Building Official shall inspect
the site within five (5) days of the notification.
   (j)   At all times relative to the drilling, operation and capping of the
well, the well and all tank facilities shall be secured from public access by
sufficient fencing. The sufficiency of the fencing shall be determined by the
Building Official.
   (k)   Within thirty (30) days after the drilling operations have been
completed and the site restored, the Permit Holder shall plant sufficient
vegetation which, in conjunction with any fencing and natural vegetation, shall
effectively and permanently screen all above-ground facilities (including well
head and tank locations) for both summer and winter conditions from all
neighbors and from all public and private rights-of-way while such facilities
are on the subject premises for the life of the well. The Building Official
shall determine the sufficiency of the screening and may order the Permit
Holder to plant more vegetation.
   (l)   The Permit Holder shall give the Fire Chief at least forty-eight (48)
hours notice before commencing to drill.
   (m)   A cash bond, performance bond or escrow account of five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00) per well shall be filed with the Building Official to
ensure sufficient securing and screening of facilities, as provided herein, and
the removal of all equipment and the restoration of the site after the well is
drilled. The Municipality shall return the bond upon the restoration of the
site after the well has been drilled and all equipment has been removed and all
the terms of this Chapter
1513 have been complied with. Any expenses the Village incurs as a result of
the drilling including engineering, legal, repair of streets, sidewalks,
curbing, tree lawns or berms within the Village shall be withheld from the
deposit. The amount of the bond shall be reviewed every five (5) years and may
be increased based on inflationary increases.
   (n)   Notwithstanding Section
1315.13 of the Building and Housing Code, drilling operations may occur twenty-
four hours per day until the permitted depth is reached.
   (o)   It shall be a violation of this section for a Permit Holder to violate
the terms and conditions of the state issued permit.
   (p)   The Fire Chief or his designee shall, within two (2) business days of
receipt of the plans pursuant to subsection (c) hereof, review said plans and
immediately advise the Permit Holder if anything shown on the plans does not
comply with the regulations set forth herein. In the event that any Permit
Holder fails to comply with the regulations herein promulgated, the
administrative official responsible for the enforcement hereof (i.e., the
Building Official or Fire Chief, as designated herein), shall provide written
notice to the owner of the property and the Permit Holder within forty-eight
(48) hours of the discovery of such failure to comply. Such service shall be
made to the addresses identified in paragraph (b) hereof, and if no address has
been provided, to any address identified on the permit issued by the State of
Ohio. The notice shall advise the owner and the Permit Holder that if they wish
to appeal the decision of the administrative official, the time for appeal is
five (5) days after service of the notice. (Ord. 2006-07. Passed 2-14-06.)
   (q)   The Permit Holder shall be responsible for filing a monthly Inspection
Report for the wellhead and tank battery. The Inspection Report shall be
submitted to the Fire Department. The Inspection Report shall address repairs
completed and any incidents or emergencies during the month.
   (r)   The Permit Holder shall be responsible for providing an employee/
contractor (“Pumper”) who will be responsible for the oil and gas well. The
Pumper shall be qualified and responsible for maintaining the well and to take
whatever action(s) necessary to mitigate any hazardous condition.
   (s)   Upon receiving notice that a safety issue has been detected at the
Permit Holder’s well, the Permit Holder or its Pumper shall respond. The
maximum acceptable response time (as defined by the Fire Department) is thirty
(30) minutes. Response time is defined as the elapsed time between notification
of the Permit Holder (per section (h)) that a problem exists and the Pumper’s
arrival at the well site. The Fire Department has the authority to shutdown the
well.
   (t)   The Fire Chief is responsible for primary coordination in emergency
situation(s) per Ohio Revised Code 3737.80.
   (u)   The Permit Holder shall install “hold-open” latches on all wellhead
and tank battery enclosures.
   (v)   The Permit Holder grants “Right of Entry” to any facility to the Fire
Department for any purpose. (Ord. 2009-15. Passed 7-14-09; Ord. 2014-03. Passed
4-8-14.)
   1513.04 APPEAL.
   Any determination of any administrative official, in applying the
regulations promulgated hereunder, which is adverse to the rights of any owner
of property or any Permit Holder may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning
Commission by filing a notice of appeal with the Building Official within five
(5) days of notification by the administrative official that the Permit Holder
has not complied with the regulation. The appeal shall be heard at the next
Planning and Zoning Commission meeting, but such further hearings may be held
as required for the Commission to resolve the appeal. The decision of the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall be final within the Municipality.
(Ord. 2006-07. Passed 2-14-06.)
   1513.99 PENALTY.

   (b)   In lieu of or in addition to the prosecution of a violation of this
Chapter, and upon the authorization of the Mayor, the Law Director may

to prevent an unlawful condition, to restrain, correct or abate a violation; or
to require compliance with this Chapter or other applicable laws, ordinances,
rules or regulations.
