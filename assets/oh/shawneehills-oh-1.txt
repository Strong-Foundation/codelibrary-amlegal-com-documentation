EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein. (ORC
1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance. (ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended. (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance. (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues.

documents by Robert's Rules of Order, newly revised.
   (g)   Legislation. 
      (1)   Ordinances. The term "ordinance" refers to the type of action by
Council which is of a general or permanent nature, creates a right, grants a
franchise or involves the expenditure of money, the levying of a tax, or
authorizes the purchase, lease, sale or transfer of property. Ordinances shall

Ordinances may be placed on the agenda when submitted by a member of Council
following Committee review or at any time by the Mayor, a Council Member or

action of Council in passing legislation generally referred to a declaration of
intent or purpose, the authorization of some temporary act or administrative
procedure. A resolution may initiate, direct or carry out administrative duties
and functions which are granted to Council under statutory laws or Municipal

majority of Council. Any ordinance and/or resolution so removed from the table
shall receive the same procedural or legislative reading, subject to the

procedural reading.
      (8)   Amending legislation. Any new language or any additions to existing
ordinances or resolutions shall be printed in capital letters or bold so that

   (h)   Conduct of Discussion.
      (1)   Policy. When an ordinance, resolution, or motion is before Council,
an adequate opportunity shall be provided for all members of Council to be
heard. However, in order to expedite business and to assure that a minority
cannot effectively abrogate the desire of the majority by dominating the floor
and thus prevent a vote, the rules of discussion contained in the following
requirements are set forth as the official policy of Council.
      (2)   Conduct of presiding officer. The Presiding Officer shall recognize
members and other persons who wish to address Council, prior to such member or
person taking the floor. All persons not personally known by Council shall
furnish their name, address, and the reason for their appearance upon request
of the Presiding officer prior to being recognized. The Presiding Officer may
utilize the following rules when exercising his control of the discussion of
any ordinance, resolution or motion:
         A.   No member or person shall be permitted to speak longer than five
minutes at any one time;
         B.   No member or person shall be permitted to speak more than two
times for or against the proposition under consideration;
         C.   While members may yield to other members, the limitations set
forth in subsection (2)A. and B. hereof shall prevail;
         D.   No member or person shall be permitted to speak the second time
until all members have been heard at least once or a member who has not been
heard wishes the floor;
         E.   The Presiding Officer, subject to challenge by Council, may
refuse the floor to any member or person where the tactics are obviously
dilatory and not in the best interest of Council;
         F.   The above rules may be suspended to permit unlimited debate by a
vote of three-fourths majority of Council.
            (Ord. 03-2003. Passed 12-10-03.)
      (3)   Excusal during meeting. No member shall be excused from attendance
while Council is in session except upon permission of the Presiding Officer.
         (Ord. 09-2004. Passed 7-26-04.)
   (i)   Voting. 
      (1)   Voting. Except as otherwise provided in these rules or by law, all
ordinances and resolutions will be voted upon in open Council, and shall be
oral roll call votes. The roll call voting shall be by sponsors first and than
for the remaining members of Council as called by the Clerk. The Clerk shall
call the roll and each Council member will respond either "aye" or "yes", "nay"
or "no", or "abstain". No other comment shall be considered proper during the
vote. The Clerk shall record the vote and the same shall be preserved in the
minutes of the meeting. After the vote is complete, the Presiding Officer shall
disclose the results thereof. Except as otherwise provided herein, or by law, a
majority shall carry any resolution, ordinance, or motion. The Mayor shall have
no vote except as provided by the Ohio Revised Code in a tie vote. The
President of Council shall have a vote while conducting a Council meeting. No
question concerning the vote of any member will be proper after the vote is
called.
      (2)   Abstaining vote. No member shall be questioned concerning the
necessity of an abstaining vote. A decision to abstain is a matter personal to
each member and under no condition may this action be challenged. Each member
is urged to use his careful discretion in this matter. An abstaining vote shall
be treated as neither a positive nor a negative vote and a member who casts an
abstaining vote shall not be recorded as voting on either side of the
questions.
   (j)   Amendments of Rules; Adoption and Reenactment. The rules of Council as
established in this section may be amended by legislation adopted by a majority
of Council after proper action by the Rules Committee.

Chap.   
171.   Mayor's Court
 
 
 
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio Statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9 (B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in  Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality.
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

181.01 AUTHORITY TO LEVY TAX; PURPOSE OF TAX.
   (A)    To provide funds for the purposes of general municipal operations,
maintenance, new equipment, extension and enlargement of municipal services and
facilities and capital improvements, the Village of Shawnee Hills (hereinafter
"Village") levies an annual municipal income tax on income, qualifying wages,
commissions and other compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided.
   (B)   (1)    The annual tax is levied at a rate of 2% (two percent). The tax
is levied at a uniform rate on all persons residing in or earning or receiving
income in Village. The tax is levied on income, qualifying wages, commissions
and other compensation, and on net profits as hereinafter provided in Section
181.03 of this Chapter and other sections as they may apply.
      (2)    Intentionally left blank.
   (C)    The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this Chapter
181.01 to

tax is levied in accordance with, and is intended to be consistent with, the
provisions and limitations of Ohio Revised Code 718 (ORC 718). Ordinance 28-
2015 does not repeal the existing sections of Chapter
181 for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather amends Chapter

2016. For municipal taxable years beginning before January 1, 2016, the Village
shall continue to administer, audit, and enforce the income tax of the Village
under ORC 718 and ordinances and resolutions of the Village as that chapter and
those ordinances and resolutions existed before January 1, 2016.

the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (F)
(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
181.04 of this Chapter.

Withholding provisions
         
   (A)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in Village shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in Village. Except for qualifying wages
for which withholding is not required under Section
181.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
181.01, of 2%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct
and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer,
agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the
qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
   (B)    (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of Village in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
      Payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the
Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for
which the tax was withheld.
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)   Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Village. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and Village as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Village income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Village during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year,;
         (c)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Village income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of

section, an employer is not required to withhold Village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in Village if the employee performed such services in Village on 20 or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in

            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed

181.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in Village
only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of
the employer in Village than in any other municipal corporation on that day.
For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform

      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in Village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to Village for any subsequent days in that calendar year
on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in Village.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for Village under
division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for Village for
the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in Village.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is Village and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
181.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of Village.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
181.04. (Ord. 28-2015. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)   An annual Village income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the

      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
181.05 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due Village.
      (2)   Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Village income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which

receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to Village, at which time the retiree
shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of the
following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2,
"Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's
federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form

Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of this

a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G) (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each return required
to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as required by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the filing of state

      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended
due date of the Village's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of
the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file
under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month

the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Village income tax return. If the request is received by
the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Village income tax return is
due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Village's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
ncome tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)    (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to Village for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with Village an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section, unless the
provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to Village income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a return with Village for the
immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed services at a
worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)(g) within Village.
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in Village and does
not expect to be subject to Village income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within Village. The affidavit shall also include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
Village, make any sales in Village, or otherwise become subject to the tax
levied by Village during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject
to the tax levied by Village for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be
considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with Village income
tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit
under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return for the
taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that conflicts
with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator form performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for Village by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
181.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by Village, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to Village, and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by Village to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by Village, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by Village
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter
and of Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.

   (M)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file Village's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the

serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Village for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by Village during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter. The
application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth (180th) day
after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide
such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty first (181st) day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. The Tax Administrator may
prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
However, taxes pursuant to a contract entered into under this division are not
delinquent, and the Tax Administrator shall not require any payments of
penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of this
division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)   For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.

   (S)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five (5) year period beginning with the
first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for
each subsequent five (5) year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue
filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five (5) year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five (5) year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code is
terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code is
binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated Village
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated Village income
tax return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Village income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)    (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
181.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section (
181.02)(C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
181.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to
Village;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Village income tax return shall
make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
181.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Village income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by Village in accordance with this Chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Village before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with Village may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in Village who is required to and
does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed 100% of the amount obtained by multiplying the income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax in the other
municipality by the LOWER of the tax rate in such other municipality OR the
rate of 1.75%.
   (B)    Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of Village who works in a joint economic development zone created under Section
715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Section 715.70,
715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants a credit against
its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another municipal
corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
   (D)    Intentionally left blank.

current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to Village for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax

on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the beginning
of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to Village, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability

         (c)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;

      (3)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
181.05.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
181.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date

      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
Village under Section
181.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Village but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year. (Ord. 30-2017. Passed 12-11-17.)
181.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds

entered on the document.
(Ord. 28-2015. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
181.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (C)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
181.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
181.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 28-2015. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with Village, but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Village as a refund but is
subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Village is subject to recovery by Village. If
Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, Village shall
allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding Village claims is
due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid
to the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using Village's
tax rate. However, if Village's tax rate is greater than the tax rate in the
other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is to be
paid to Village, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during the
period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carry forward.
(Ord. 28-2015. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
181.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by Village. A request filed under this division shall claim refund
of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
181.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to Village
income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Village income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.

limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:

assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
181.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the local board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
181.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Village does not prejudice any claim
for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
181.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
181.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover Village income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 28-2015. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 28-2015. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 28-2015. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to Village that arises pursuant to Village's income tax imposed in accordance
with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
municipal corporation:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 28-2015. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Village as
authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit Village from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 28-2015. Passed 11-9-15.)
181.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by Village ordinance or state law to
be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud Village or the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 28-2015. Passed 11-9-15.)

years beginning on or after January 1, 2016;
         (b)   Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to Village on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)   This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
Village to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

remittance of income tax, estimated income tax, or withholding tax or to file
timely with the Village any return required to be filed, the following

181.19 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORATION.
Authority.
   (A)    Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the ORC:
      (1)   (a)    Exercise all powers whatsoever of an query nature as
provided by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records,
memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
          (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall
be exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance
of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under Village's
income tax ordinance;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)    Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and

respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)    Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax

computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made.
         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or
other appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-
determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the
withholding obligations described in Section

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by Village or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Identification information.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
            (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for
identifying information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid
identifying information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this
Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person
to whom the request was directed pursuant to Section
181.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
181.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
181.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
181.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
181.99 for a violation of Section
181.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.
(Ord. 28-2015. Passed 11-9-15.)

members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of Village, but such
appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with Village
at any time during their term or in the five years immediately preceding the
date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor. This member

equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.

appointed by the Mayor shall serve at the discretion of the Mayor.
       (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against

or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the

Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in
rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items
after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the
notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if applicable. The

         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars

Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may

to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the

   •   The conduct of the event will substantially interrupt the safe and
orderly movement of other traffic contiguous to its route.
   •   The conduct of the event or the number of events scheduled during the
time period will require the diversion of so great a number of other Village
employees, such as Police, Parks or Streets & Utilities staff, that adequate

event or assembly sites will substantially interfere with adequate fire and
police protection of, or emergency medical service to, areas near such sites.
   •   The conduct of the event may result in violence to persons or property,
causing serious harm to the public.
   •   The event is to be held for the primary purpose of advertising a
product, goods, or service.

surrounding residents and businesses, or has been used frequently.
   •   The date or location of the event is in direct conflict with an existing

Hills community.
   (d)   Permits.

responsible for paying fees on any services incurred.
   (f)   Enforcement of other laws.

officer to arrest a person engaged in any act or activity granted under this
policy, if the conduct of such person violates the laws of the state or
ordinances of the Village of Shawnee Hills, or unreasonably obstructs the
public streets and sidewalks of the Village, or if such person engaged in acts
that cause or would tend to cause a breach of the peace.
   •   The granting of any Event Permit required by this policy shall not
eliminate the requirements for any business license or any other permits which
may be prescribed by any other federal, state or local statutes, ordinances,
rules or regulations; or compliance with any other applicable federal, state or
local statutes ordinances, rules or regulations.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC

during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:

exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the

turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow

intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,

flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:

within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed

stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.

started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,

analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive

under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the

attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.

consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.

addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of

line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by subsection (b)(4) hereof and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by subsection (b)(7) hereof. The end of every school zone may be marked by a

and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control devices shall be
construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;
            2.    Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed
with the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce in compliance with O.A.C. §

the jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment of a school
zone;

school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.

information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet

shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared
or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider whether the
evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.
   (g)   Points shall be assessed for violation of a limitation under
subsection (d) hereof in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
   (h)   Whenever, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or this section, the

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
 
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for

seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02. (ORC 4510.12)

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

driving privileges if the court finds reasonable cause to believe that the
restrictions established in subsection (c)(1) will seriously affect the
person’s ability to continue in employment or educational training or will
cause undue hardship on the license holder or a family member of the license
holder. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall specify the

on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as

violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of

equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver’s
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (f)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order
from the court, neither the Ohio Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy
registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or

under this section and who, during the suspension, operates any motor vehicle
upon any public roads and highways is guilty of driving under a twelve-point
suspension, a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court shall sentence the
offender to a minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the
first three days of jail time imposed pursuant to this subsection. (ORC

   (i)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency. (ORC 4510.04)

sentence the offender to a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring in
lieu of the mandatory portion of the jail term.
         B.   Notwithstanding the fines set forth in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, a

on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the sixty-day period following the date
of sentencing.

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.

be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.
(ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
"The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:

for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

purpose;

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of

involved in the offense.
 
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.

the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

issuance of Permits to Persons for such use or occupancy, and to set forth the
policies of the Village related thereto.
   (b)    This Chapter does not take the place of any franchise, license, or

permits necessary to the operations and conduct of its business.
   (c)    No person shall use, occupy, own or operate facilities in, under or

at reasonable rates;
      (4)   To promote cooperation among the Village and Franchisees and

      (5)   To ensure adequate public compensation for the regulation of the
private use of the Rights of Way and regulation thereof; and
      (6)   To promote and require reasonable accommodation of all uses of
Rights of Way and to establish the following priority of use of Rights of Way,
when all requested usage of Rights of Way by Permittees cannot be accommodated:

Permittees and Franchisees to cooperate to accommodate use by other Permittees
and Franchisees, and provided further that Village Administrator may alter
these priorities when the Village Administrator reasonably determines a
deviation therefrom to be in the public interest.
   (e)   Nothing in this chapter should be construed to apply the provisions of
this chapter to facilities owned or operated by the Village or any of its

beginning the erection, installation or maintenance, including tree trimming,
of any lines or equipment in any right-of-way within the Village. Unless
otherwise expressly exempted by this Chapter, no work in the Rights of Way
shall be commenced until such time as all required permits, including a Right
of Way Work Permit, have been issued by the Village.
(Ord. 13-2011. Passed 6-27-11.)
      (1)   A.   Each ROW Work Permit shall be confined to a single project,
shall be issued by the Village Administrator, and shall be valid only for such
dates as authorized by the Village Administrator. The Application, at a
minimum, shall set forth the information set forth in sub-section (k) below and
be made on a form prescribed by the Administrator. The Application shall be
accompanied by an application fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00),
payable with check or money order.
         B.   If the Village determines, at its sole discretion, it must
perform any additional inspections, after the initial project review and
inspection, the Village shall charge the permit applicant one hundred twenty-
five dollars ($125.00) per inspection. Any additional inspection fees must be
either paid prior to the inspection being performed or can be deducted from the
deposit described below.
         C.   The Village Administrator will require a deposit, in the form of
a certified check, personal check, or performance bond, sufficient to cover the
entire cost of restoration. The Village Administrator, at his sole discretion,
shall determine the project's classification (Minor, Mid-Range, or Major), the
amount of the deposit, and the payment method. For Minor Projects, which
involve an insignificant amount of work within, or disturbance of, the right-
of-way, the deposit shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00). For Mid-
Range Projects, which involve an ordinary amount of work within, or disturbance
of, the right-of-way, the deposit shall not exceed one thousand two hundred
fifty dollars ($1,250.00). For Major Projects, which involve an substantial
amount of work within, or disturbance of, the right-of-way, the deposit shall
be at least two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00). The Village
Administrator should consult with the Village Engineer when reviewing the
project, assessing the reasonably anticipated impact on the ROW, and
determining the deposit amount.
         D.   The deposit shall be returned only if the Village Administrator
believes that prompt and satisfactory refilling of excavations and restorations
of all surfaces disturbed has occurred. Upon failure or refusal of the
permittee to satisfactorily fill the excavation, restore the surface and remove
all excess materials within the time specified in the permit, the Village
Administrator shall proceed without notice to make such fill and restoration
and remove excess material, and he deposit shall be deemed forfeited.
Thereupon, such deposit shall be paid into the Village of Shawnee Hills Street
Construction, Repair, and Maintenance Fund, except such part paid to the
permittee as the difference between the deposit, any additional inspections
fees, and the charges of the Village for restoration services performed by it
or performed under the Village's direction. If the amount of such services
performed by the Village, or its designee, should exceed the amount of such
deposit, the Village of Shawnee Hills shall proceed, without notice, to collect
the remainder due from the permittee.
         E.   The Village Administrator shall establish the effective dates for
the ROW Work Permit based upon the nature of work to be performed. In the event
the work authorized by the ROW Work Permit is not complete prior to the
expiration of the ROW Work Permit, the Applicant shall reapply for another ROW
Work Permit and pay an additional application fee.
            (Ord. 29-2017. Passed 1-8-18.)
      (2)   Prior Village approval shall not be required for Emergency repairs,
or routine maintenance repairs or operations which do not require excavation in
the Right of Way, blockage of any street or alley, or material disruption to
any landscaping or structures and/or irrigation systems. The Permittee and/or
its subcontractors shall leave Rights of Way where such work is done in as good
condition or repair as they were before such work was commenced and to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Village.
      (3)   Upon failure or refusal of the ROW Work Permittee satisfactorily to
fill the excavation, restore the surface, and remove all excess materials
within the time specified in the permit or where not specified therein, within
a reasonable time after commencement of the work, the Village may proceed,
without notice, to make such fill and restoration and the deposit referred to
herein shall be deemed forfeited. Thereupon, the deposit shall be paid into the
street repair fund of the Village, except such part demanded and paid to the
Permittee as the difference between the deposit and the charges of the Village
for restoration services performed by it. If the amount of such services
performed by the Village exceeds the amount of the deposit, the Fiscal Officer,
Village Administrator, or his/her designee may take an action, in law or
equity, to collect the remainder due from the Permittee.
      (4)   Such Right of Way Work Permit shall be issued in writing and is
subject to conditions that may be attached by the Village Administrator
including, but not limited to, requirements concerning traffic control, safety,
scheduling, notification of adjoining property owners, and restoration with
seed, sod or specific plant materials as directed by the Village. The Permittee
and/or its subcontractors shall endeavor to complete, in a timely manner,
repairs to the Right of Way. All workmanship and materials used by the
Permittee and/or its subcontractors to perform work within the Right of Way and
to complete restoration, including repair the streets and roadways shall be
subject to the inspection and approval of Village Administrator or their
authorized agent and shall be warranted for a period of one (1) year from the
date of completion for any failure due to workmanship or quality of materials.
   (k)    All Applicants for Right of Way Work Permits shall file a written
notice with the Village, except in the case of emergency as determined by
Council. The applicant shall file such written notice prior to working in or on
the Right of Way so as to provide the Village with a reasonable and sufficient
amount of time to review such Right of Way Work Permit Application. In addition
to such other information this Chapter shall require, this notice shall contain
or indicate to the extent applicable:
      (1)    The Right of Way affected;
      (2)    A description of any facilities to be installed, constructed or
maintained;
      (3)    Whether or not any street will be opened or otherwise need to be

close any street opening or repair any damage done to facilitate such work;
      (6)    A statement verifying that other affected or potentially affected
Permittees and Franchisees have been notified; and
      (7)    A statement that any consumers of any utility, cable television,
communications or other service which will be adversely affected by such work
have been or will be notified in conformance with applicable rules and
regulations of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.
   An Applicant for a Right of Way Work Permit shall not begin working in or on
the Right of Way until 48 hours after the issuance of a Right of Way Work
Permit.
   (l)    Permittee shall furnish Village "as built" drawings not later than
one hundred twenty (120) days after construction has been completed. Drawings
shall show ownership of conduits, ducts, poles and cables used for the
telecommunications or utility system. Drawings shall be drawn to a scale of no
smaller than one inch (1") equals one hundred feet (100') using the standard
format adopted by the Village. Permittee shall provide one (1) set of blue or
black line "as built" drawings to the Village. State plane coordinates shall be
shown for benchmarks, curb lines, and structures. Drawings shall show
horizontal dimensions from the curb line and elevations.
   (m)    Permittees and Franchisees may, under emergency or other exigent
circumstances, work in the Right of Way so long as the Permittee or Franchisee
uses Best Efforts to provide the Village the notice required by this subsection
at the earliest possible time.
(Ord. 13-2011. Passed 6-27-11.)
907.10 VILLAGE USE OF FACILITIES.
   (a)    The Village shall have the right to install and maintain, free of
charge, upon any poles and within any underground pipes and conduits or like
facilities of any Telecommunication and Utility or Special Permittee,
communications facilities ("Village Facilities") solely for governmental use
desired by the Village unless:
      (1)   Such installation and maintenance unreasonably and materially
interferes with existing and future operations of the Permittee; or
      (2)   Such installation and maintenance would be unduly burdensome to
such Permittee. Each Permittee shall cooperate with the Village in the planning
and design of its facilities so as to accommodate the Village's reasonably
disclosed governmental requirements. Neither the Village Facilities nor the
capacity or bandwidth thereon shall be leased, licensed or otherwise made
available to third parties.
         (Ord. 13-2011. Passed 6-27-11.)
907.11 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.
   (a)    To the fullest extent permitted by law, all Permittees shall, at
their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Village, its officers, public officials, boards and commissions, agents,
employees and representatives from and against any and all lawsuits, claims
(including without limitation Worker's Compensation claims against the Village
or others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or
damages (including but not limited to expenses for reasonable legal fees and

attributable to the occupation by the Permittee of the Right of Way, to which
Permittee's negligence shall in any way contribute, and regardless of whether
the Village's negligence or the negligence of any other party shall have
contributed to such claim, cause of action, judgment, injury or damage.
      (2)    Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy, for
defamation of any person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement

claims arising out of or related to Village programming.
      (3)    Arising out of Permittee's failure to comply with the provisions

   (c)    The Village shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense
thereof, and the Permittee shall pay the reasonable fees and expense of such
separate counsel, if employed, or if representation of both Permittee and the
Village by the same attorney would be inconsistent with accepted canons of
professional ethics.

coverage by Permittees having capitalization in excess of fifty million
dollars), as determined by the Village in accordance with the following:
      (1)   General Liability Insurance. By its acceptance of any Permit

Way, such Permittee shall submit a notice to the Village describing the portion
of the facilities to be removed or abandoned and the date of removal or
abandonment, which date shall not be less than thirty (30) days from the date

accepted by the Village.
   (c)    Within thirty (30) days following written notice from the Village,
any Permittee or other Person that owns, controls or maintains any unauthorized
telecommunications or utility facility or related appurtenances within the
Rights of Way of the Village shall, at its own expense, remove such facilities

the Permittee shall immediately be divested without a further act upon the part
of the Village. At Village's option and to the extent permitted or in the
manner required by applicable State law, Village shall either accept title to
Permittee's facilities in accordance with Section
907.12, or Village shall require or seek to require, as the case may be,
Permittee to remove its facilities from the Rights of Way. If Village requires
removal, the Permittee shall forthwith remove its structures or property from
the Rights of Way and restore it to such condition as the Village may require.
The cost thereof shall be a lien upon all facilities and property of the
Permittee. Such lien shall not attach to property of Permittee located on the
poles of other utilities until removal of such property from the pole or poles.
   (c)    Procedures for Termination.

violation or failure to comply with the Permit. Permittee shall have a period
of sixty (60) days after receipt of such notice from the Village in which to
cease such violation and comply with the terms and provisions hereof. In the
event Permittee fails to cease such violation or to otherwise comply with the
terms hereof, then Permittee's Permit is subject to termination under the
following provisions; provided, however, if the Permittee commences work or
other efforts satisfactory to the Village to cure such violations within thirty
(30) days after receipt of written notice and shall thereafter prosecute such
curative work with reasonable diligence until such curative work is completed,
then such violations shall cease to exist, and the Permit will not be
terminated. If the curative work is not completed within ninety (90) days of
commencement of such work, Permittee shall report to Village with respect to
the progress made on such curative work and the anticipated completion date.
      (2)   Termination shall be declared only by a written decision of the
Village Council after an appropriate public proceeding whereby the Permittee is
afforded the full opportunity to be heard and to respond to any such notice of
violation or failure to comply. The Permittee shall be provided at least ten
(10) days prior written notice of any public hearing concerning the termination
of the Permit and, in addition, ten (10) days notice by publication shall be
given of the date, time and place of any public hearing to interested members
of the public, which notice shall be paid for by the Permittee.
      (3)    The Village Council, after full public hearing, and upon finding a
material violation or failure to comply, may in its discretion terminate the
Permit, or impose a lesser penalty than termination of the Permit, or excuse
the violation or failure to comply upon a showing by the Permittee of
mitigating circumstances or upon a showing of good cause of said violation or
failure to comply as may be determined by the Village Council.
   (d)    Receivership. The Village shall have the right to terminate the
Permit one hundred twenty (120) days after the appointment of a receiver, or

receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other action or proceeding, unless
such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of said one hundred and twenty (120) days or unless:
      (1)    Within one hundred and twenty (120) days after his/her election or
appointment, such receiver or trustee shall have fully complied with all the
provisions of the Permit and remedied all defaults thereunder; and
      (2)    Such receiver or trustee, within said one hundred and twenty (120)
days, shall have executed an agreement, duly approved by the court having
jurisdiction in the premises, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and
agrees to be bound by each and every provision of the Permit.
         (Ord. 13-2011. Passed 6-27-11.)

communications or like facilities; grading, paving, maintaining, repairing,
relocating or altering any street or Right of Way; or constructing,
maintaining, relocating or repairing any sidewalk or other public work or
improvement.

specifically permitted by the Village to continue the same or such continuance
of use is permitted by state law, and upon the removal thereof, restore,
repair, or reconstruct the area where such removal has occurred to a condition
materially equivalent to that existing before such removal took place. In the
event of failure, neglect or refusal of the Permittee after thirty (30) days
written notice by the Village to remove the facilities or to repair, restore,
reconstruct, improve or maintain such vacated area, the Village may, if in
accordance with applicable law, do such work or cause it to be done, and the

available remedy.
(Ord. 13-2011. Passed 6-27-11.)

expressed by ordinance and then only on such reasonable conditions as may be
prescribed therein. No transfer of the Permit shall be approved unless the
assignee or transferee has the legal, technical, financial and other requisite
qualifications to own a Permit pursuant to this Chapter. Unless otherwise
provided in a Permit, the Permittee shall reimburse the Village for all direct

921.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   It is the purpose of this chapter to establish guidelines, policies,
procedures, rates and penalties for the safe, efficient, and sound fiscal
operation of the wastewater collection and transfer system owned by the Village
of Shawnee Hills. This regulation is required to comply with the requirements
of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency and the City of Columbus contractual agreement.
   (b)   The Sewer Use Regulation is intended to protect and preserve the
physical integrity of the sewage collection and transfer system.
   (c)   The User Charge System is intended to ratably recover from the classes
of sewer system users the costs of operation, maintenance, capital debt,
repair, replacement and reasonable contingencies.
   (d)   The Industrial Pretreatment Regulation is intended to establish
guidelines and standards necessary for the control of industrial waste
discharged into the Village sewage disposal system in order to prevent the
introduction of pollutants into the wastewater system which could upset the
normal operation.
(Ord. 12-2001. Passed 9-10-01.)
   (e)   We hereby adopt the City of Columbus Code Section 1147.01 through
1147.99 and 1145.01 through 1145.99 and all future amendments and revisions
thereto. The Village hereby adopts the City of Columbus Clean River Fund
formula for determination of each sewer user’s allocated fees of the Fund
charges as follows:
   All properties having impervious area within the Village will be assigned an
equivalent residential unit (ERU), or a multiple thereof, with all properties
having impervious area receiving at least one (1) ERU.
      (1)   Residential properties. All residential properties will be assigned
one (1) ERU. A flat rate will apply to all residential properties.
      (2)   Non-residential properties. Non-residential properties will be
assigned an ERU multiple based upon the properties’ individually measured
impervious area (in square feet) divided by two thousand (2,000) square feet
(one (1) ERU). This division will be calculated to the first decimal place and
rounded according to mathematical convention.
   This fee shall be charged monthly to all Village sewer users.
(Ord. 20-2007. Passed 5-21-07.)
   (f)   In the event of any discrepancy between the two codes, the more
restrictive code shall be enforced.
(Ord. 12-2001. Passed 9-10-01.)
921.02 SEWER FUNDS.
   (a)   The revenues collected, as a result of the user charges levied for
sewer service, shall be deposited in a non-lapsing fund known as the Sewer
Operating Fund. A portion of the revenue shall be set aside in a separate
Replacement Fund for replacement of equipment of the sewer system. The amount
shall be determined once each year for the fund.
   (b)   Fiscal year end balances in the operating funds shall be used for no
other purposes than those designated. Monies which have been advanced from
other sources to meet temporary shortages in the operating funds shall be
returned to their respective accounts upon appropriate adjustment of the user
charge rates for operation, maintenance and replacement. The user charge rate
(s) shall be adjusted such that the advanced monies will be returned to their
respective accounts within six months of the fiscal year in which the monies
were borrowed.
(Ord. 12-2001. Passed 9-10-01.)
921.03 RATES AND CHARGES.
   (a)    Potable Water User Charge. The Village will not provide free service
to anyone. Each potable water user shall pay for the sewer service provided by
the Village of Shawnee Hills based on water use as determined by Del-Co Water
Company, Inc. The monthly sewer service charge for each user shall be based on
the cost of water usage, operation cost, maintenance and repair (OMR), debt
service (DSC), and any applicable sewer surcharge rate (SSR). Each month, each
Potable Water User shall pay the following:
      A flat fee of $17.27 + $0.832 for every 100 gallons of water used (as
read and recorded by Del-Co Water Company) + a flat fee of $18.90 (DSC) + $3.39
per ERU + any applicable SSR
      (Ord. 02-2024. Passed 1-22-24.)
   (b)   Well Water User Charge. The Village will not provide free service to
anyone. Each well water user shall pay for the sewer service provided by the
Village of Shawnee Hills. The monthly sewer service charge for each user shall
be based on the cost of water usage, operation cost, maintenance and repair
(OMR), debt service (DSC), and any applicable sewer surcharge rate (SSR). Each
month, each Well Water User shall pay the following:
      A flat fee of $40.12 + a flat fee of $18.90 (DSC) + $3.39 per ERU + any
applicable SSR
      (Ord. 04-2023. Passed 3-13-23.)
   (c)   Sewage Surcharge Rate (SSR). SSR shall be the base rate per EDU plus
15% or the proportionate rate for payment of the cost to treat wastewater
discharges containing concentrations of BOD and SS higher than those expresses
in the definition of normal domestic wastewater shall be based upon Section
1147.07 through 1147.11 of the Columbus City Code and all future amendments.
   SSR-BOD or SSR-SS = C x D
   Where C =   Additional pounds of BOD or SS
      D =    Current cost per pound to treat normal BOD, SS loads of TKN (cost
per pound as shown in Section 1147.11 outside City total charge).
   (d)   Upon written notification to the Village of excessive water usage
(i.e. filling a swimming pool, routine lawn watering, or other outside water
usage), the Village will use the prior six month history from October thru
March to determine whether to credit the Potable Water User for the excess
water usage. If there is no history for those six months the Village will base
the usage on 3500 gallons per month.
   (e)   Any user who discharges to the sanitary sewer system any substance
which singly or by interaction with other substances causes identifiable
increase in the cost of operation, maintenance or replacement of the sewage
treatment facilities, shall pay for such increased costs. The charge to each
such user shall be determined by the appropriate financial personnel and
approved by the Village Administrator.
   (f)   When either or both the total suspended solids and the BOD of a water
or a waste accepted for admission to the system exceeds the values of their
constituents for normal domestic sewage, the excess concentration in either or
both, as the case may be, shall be subject to a surcharge based on the cost per
pound to remove the excess quantity of each constituent. In addition to the
surcharge, the user will pay the user charges as defined in other sections of
this section.
   (g)   In addition to a surcharge on BOD and suspended solids, the Village
shall have the right to surcharge any user for the discharge of any pollutant
into the sewage system or for any other reason deemed necessary and

(VOSH Lineal Foot Frontage Fee). The number of feet to be paid shall be
determined by one of the following applicable methods:
            (i)   Lots or parcels of ground having the same width at the front
and rear and the same depth on each shall be charged for on the basis of the
actual frontage.
            (ii)   Lots or parcels of ground which are irregular shape shall be
charged for on the basis of the width of the property as measured on a line
twenty (20) feet from the front lot line and parallel to the center line of the
street upon which property is to face, except that for lots or parcels of
ground having curved frontage the width to be charged for shall be measured on
a line parallel to and twenty (20) feet distant from a line tangent to the
curved frontage at a point midway between the sides of the lots or parcels of
ground.
               The width of front-footage to be paid for shall be determined by
the use of an engineer's scale applied to the record drawings of the sewers
sought to be tapped, on file with the Village, and the widths so determined by
the Village Engineer shall be final.
   
               For Example: A house constructed on the default 6-lot
configuration would pay:
               (35' x 3 lots) =105' x $45/ft = $4,725.00
      (3)   In the event a meter is subsequently enlarged, the difference
between the Connection Fee for the two (2) meter sizes shall be paid before the
Village will issue a permit for the new larger/smaller meter. No refunds of
fees will be made.
      (4)   Moneys received from the fees shall be deposited into the
Enterprise Improvement Fund and used for the payment of the costs to operate
and maintain the sewer system and to make capital improvements to the sewer
system.
         There is no Connection Fee or Inspection Fee for fire suppression.
   (c)   All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of
a sanitary sewer to the Village lines shall be paid solely by the property
owner. The owner shall indemnify and hold harmless the Village from any loss or
damage that may be directly or indirectly caused by the installation of such
sewer connection.
  
   (d)   The Inspection Fee includes the cost of an inspection up to two (2)
hours by the Village or its duly authorized representative. Should more than
two (2) hours of inspection be required because of failure of the owner, his
contractor, or authorized representative to install, repair, alter, or perform
other work necessary to install the connection and service line in accordance
with these regulations, an additional fee as established by the Village shall
be charged for the time required to comply with these regulations. Such
additional fees shall be paid prior to the final approval of the service line
for which the permit was issued.
   (e)   In the event the Village determines any property has been connected to
the sewage system without a permit, the Village may disconnect such property
until a permit is applied for and issued. In the event a property is
disconnected and subsequently reconnected under this section, the owner shall
be subject to the Village's disconnection and/or reconnection charges. Such
charges shall be added to the customer's sewer service bill.
   (f)   A separate and independent building Connection Fee, Inspection Fee,
and VOSH Lineal Foot Frontage Fee shall be paid for every building/structure.
   (g)   Old or existing sewers may be used in connection with new buildings
only when they are found on examination and tested by an authorized
representative of the Village to meet the requirements of this chapter. This
inspection will be at the owner's expense not to exceed the out-of-pocket cost
of the Village. If there is an increase in water capacity, then the owner will
pay the increased Connection Fee.
   (h)   The building sewer shall be constructed of a pipe not less than six
(6) inches, internal diameter, and shall be as per the City of Columbus
Construction and Materials Specifications Section 901, current edition, and
also meeting the ASTM specifications using proper bends or curves for all
changes in alignment or grade. All joints and connections shall be gasketed per
ASTM specifications and shall be made gas-tight and water-tight. The Village or
its duly authorized representative may require the sewer installer to
demonstrate the tightness of the joints by such tests as deemed necessary and
require additional jointing material or concrete collars at any or all joints.
   (i)   The building sewer shall have a minimum fall of one-fourth inch per
linear foot of sewer from the building to the public sewer. The Village may, by
special permission in each case authorize the building sewer to be constructed
with a fall as little as one-eighth inch per linear foot if they determine such
procedure to be necessary. The interior of each length of pipe shall be made
perfectly clean from offsets, fins, and projections before the next length is
connected thereto. The grade for building sewers shall be established by
electronic equipment.
   (j)   Whenever possible, the sewer shall be brought to the building at an
elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid within five
(5) feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall
be sufficient to afford protection from frost. The sewer shall be laid at
uniform grade in straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction
shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings. Under no conditions
shall a 90 degree bend pipe fitting be installed into any public or private
sanitary sewer line.
   (k)   In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried to such drain shall
be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer.
   (l)   All excavations required for the installation of a building sewer
shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the Village or its duly
authorized representative. Where the base of the trench is uneven or stony,
sand and/or gravel shall be used for bedding. No backfill shall be placed until
the work has been inspected by an authorized representative of the Village.
   (m)   All joints and connections shall be made gas-tight and water-tight.
All sewer joints shall be as specified under subsection (h) hereof. "Mission"
or "Fernco" type flexible couplings may be acceptable in joining dissimilar
materials, subject to approval by the Village.
   (n)   In the case of existing buildings the Village shall bring the service
connection from the public sewer to a point within five (5) feet of the private
property line. For both existing structures and new construction, only
contractors authorized by the Village may connect to the sanitary sewer system
using approved materials after a permit is issued. No permit will be issued
until an approved Certificate of Zoning Compliance is granted. The wyes and/or
service connections shall be located at the convenience of the Village. The
Village shall consider the requests of the property owners, but shall be the
final authority as to location.
   (o)   An applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Village or
its duly authorized representative at least two (2) business days in advance of
when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public
sewer. The connection shall not be made until approved by a duly authorized
representative of the Village and under their supervision.
   (p)   All excavations for building sewer installations shall be adequately
guarded with barricades, steel plates and lights to protect the public from
hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in
the course of the work shall be restored to its prior condition or better in a
manner satisfactory to the Village.
   (q)   All permits for sewer connections, whether made at the initial
installation or subsequent to the operation of the system, shall be made on
forms furnished by the Village; and shall be prepared in triplicate, one copy
going to the property owner at the time of making the application and two
copies being retained by the Village.
   All sewers shall be inspected and approved by the Village or its authorized
representative after installation but before covering with backfill. The
inspections shall be requested at least two (2) business days before the
inspection is desired. Upon inspection, and after the inspector has satisfied
himself that the installation has been made according to the requirements of
this chapter, and that all possible sources of storm water have been eliminated
from the sewer, he shall make a sketch of the installation on the form retained
by the Village at the time the permit was issued and if such installation
complies with the provisions of this chapter, shall sign the same, giving one
copy to the property owner, and one copy shall be retained for the permanent
files of the Village for its record. Only after the inspector has signed the
permit may the service line be connected to the sewer and the trench filled.
 
   (r)   All vents shall be constructed so as to prevent foreign objects from
being introduced into the sanitary sewers. Tees will not be permitted in any
part of the sewer service connection. In order to protect the Village's sewer
system, the plumbing for all buildings to be connected to the system shall be
installed in accordance with the minimum requirements of the Health Department,
and any applicable standards established by the State of Ohio. This requirement
is primarily intended to apply to new building construction; however, the
inspector or Board or Administrator may require corrective work on the plumbing
systems of any existing buildings where serious violations of accepted good
practices in plumbing are observed. Such corrective action shall be completed
prior to connection of the building sewer from the affected structure to the
Village sewer system.
 
   (s)   A means for rodding or examination of the building sewer, such as
clean outs, shall be provided within five (5) feet of the point of entry to the
building or in the judgement of the Village other access is available, the same
may be acceptable.
 
   (t)   No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior
foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or
groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected
directly or indirectly to a public sewer system.
   (u)   Building sewers shall not be constructed closer than five (5) feet to
any exterior wall, cellar, basement, or cistern nor shall they have less than
three (3) feet of earth or stone cover.
 
   (v)   Where the building sewer will cross unstable soil or close to a tree
where roots may enter the joints, extra cast iron pipe may be required. PVC
pipe meeting AWWA C-900 standard or cast iron pipe shall be required when the
building sewer is within ten feet of a water service line, well, spring,
cistern or other sources of water supply.
 
   (w)   The permit holder shall repair or restore all drains, tile or service
lines damaged or disturbed by him/her during the construction of the building
sewer to the satisfaction of the Village.
 
   (x)   Following construction of the sewer, the property owner shall own,
maintain, repair or replace the sewer from the building/structure foundation to
the publicly owned sewer.
 
   (y)   If the Village receives a service call for a property to investigate a
sewage backup and performs services to clean a sewer line, which the property
owner is responsible, the Village shall charge the owner for labor, material
and equipment costs incurred. Such charges may be placed on the owner's sewer
service bill.
 
   (z)   Building sewers and connections shall meet the requirements of this
ordinance and Exhibit I attached herewith. The materials and/or equipment used
during construction shall conform to the applicable ASTM specifications as
directed by the Village.

EXHIBIT I
VILLAGE OF SHAWNEE HILLS
SANITARY HOUSE SERVICE CONNECTION SPECIFICATIONS
GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The required work consists of disconnecting house and building sanitary sewer
lines from existing on site wastewater treatment systems. New sanitary house
service connections will be constructed connecting existing house or building
sanitary drain lines (located near the building face) to house service
connection points previously terminated at road right-of-way, easement lines or
to the main sewer line if no connection has been made available. More
specifically this project may include, but is not limited to the following work
activities: clearing and grubbing; trench excavation; removal of all materials
or structures necessary for installing pipe; pipe with bedding installation;
concrete backing or encasement; compacted granular or other specified backfill;
constructing and subsequently removing all necessary pipe, fittings, cleanout
and appurtenances of the types specified; joining the existing sewer and
plumbing connections of the types specified; the emptying and demolition, or
sanitization, of existing septic tanks; restoration of disturbed facilities and
surfaces, and maintenance of traffic, drainage and existing structures.
PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
General Requirements
Unless otherwise noted, all work shall comply with the current Ohio Plumbing
Code and the City of Columbus Construction and Materials Specifications,
current edition.
Drain Tile
There are numerous unidentified storm drains and drainage tile throughout the
Village of Shawnee Hills. The Contractor shall repair and/or replace all buried
drainage conduits which are damaged during sewer excavation and installation.
Schedule 40 PVC, SDR 35 ASTM D 3034 46 psi, or better pipe must be used for
drain repair. No corrugated plastic or metal pipe shall be used for drain
repair. All drain lines hit and repaired must be noted as to type and location
and this information must be turned in to the Village at time of inspection.
Inspection
Homeowners must arrange to have all their house connection work inspected. This
inspection must take place before any trenches are backfilled. Arrangements for
inspection are to be made with the City of Columbus. Requests for inspection
must be made at least two (2) business days prior to the time the inspection is
needed. Inspections will be done Monday – Friday 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Weekend
inspections are by special arrangement only. If any work fails an inspection, a
re- inspection fee may be charged.
Construction Time Period
All house connection work must be completed within ninety (90) days of the
Hook-Up Notice.
Scheduling of Work
No work shall take place before the hour of 7:00 a.m. or after 10:00 p.m.
unless deemed an emergency and authorized by the Village.
Excavation
The Contractor shall excavate all materials of whatever nature, including rock.
All excavation, except as otherwise required, permitted or ordered in writing
by the Village or its representative shall be in open trench. Minimum trench
width shall be two (2) feet plus the diameter of the service line.
Slope
A minimum slope of ¼” per feet shall be provided for all household connection
lines. A slope of 1/8” per foot may be allowed only by special permission of
the Village and where circumstances warrant a smaller slope.
Bedding
Pipe shall be installed as per the City of Columbus Standard Drawing AA-S149.
Pipe Material and Installation
The pipe shall be six (6) inches and meet the specifications of the City of
Columbus Construction and Materials Specifications Section 901 current edition.
In the presence of a previously installed wye connection, sanitary house
service lines are to be installed from a field located point marked with a 2” x
2” stake or other clearly apparent marker at the road right-of-way line to the
existing house service line between the septic tank and the house wall. In the
absence of an installed wye, a Village authorized contractor shall install a
wye connection to the main line. The connection will be made as per the City of
Columbus Construction and Materials Specifications Section
901 current edition. Any questions as to tie in points shall be decided by the
Village or its duly authorized representatives.
Pipe Joints
The joints for sanitary house service connection lines shall conform to the
requirements of ASTM D 3212 for PVC pipe.
Cleanouts
Cleanouts shall be constructed according to the attached drawings and shall be
of schedule 40 PVC. Cleanouts shall be provided for all houses within five (5)
feet of the foundation wall unless otherwise approved by the Village or its
designated representative.
Backfill
In non-paved areas, trenches are to be backfilled with native or excavated
material. The backfill material shall be free of large stones, branches, and/or
other debris. Where excavated material available for compacting proves to be
unsuitable or the Contractor finds it impractical to use the excavated material
to meet the requirements of this item, the Contractor shall procure suitable
backfill material elsewhere and dispose of the unsuitable material. Compaction
will consist of running the excavating equipment along the backfilled ditch
line in a manner that will minimize long term settling. At all time sufficient
material cover will be maintained to prevent damage to all pipe and fittings.
Should weather conditions or timing require it, backfill in nonpaved areas may
be mounded in the ditch line until weather and soil conditions are better
suited for grading. Backfill in pavement areas and within the influence line of
the pavement shall consist of full depth compacted granular material and per
Section 912 of the City of Columbus Construction and Materials Specifications
current edition.
Surface Restoration
Upon completion of sanitary house service connection installation, the
Contractor shall regrade the work site to its original contours. The site will
be free of large stones, branches, construction debris and/or any other
undesirable materials. The site shall be restored to a condition equal to or
better then the condition prior to the work being performed. Site reseeding or
sodding will be the responsibility of the property owner. Site restoration may
be postponed until weather conditions are favorable. All site restoration shall
be completed within six (6) months of connection.
Interruption of Homeowner Service
At no time will a house be left without sewer service after the 10:00 p.m. work
stoppage time.
Work Area
All work shall be performed in a manner that will minimize the damage to the
homeowners’ property. Support equipment traffic (dump trucks, end loaders, pick
up trucks, etc) should be routed in the immediate areas of the excavation if
possible.
Pavement Replacement Within Village Right of Way
This item shall consist of removal and replacement of roadway pavements
necessary for the installation of the sanitary house service connection.
Permanent roadway replacement include the following pavement types:
   Type III A – Asphalt Driveways
   Type III B – Concrete Driveways
   Type III C – Gravel Driveways
   Roadway Pavement Replacement as per the Village standards
The Village or its appointed representative shall select the type of pavement
replacement to be provided to most nearly duplicate the pavement removed.
Pavement shall be removed, and base cut back to one (1) foot beyond the edge of
excavation. The edges shall be cut vertical and trimmed to provide a straight
line juncture between the existing and new pavement. No ragged edges shall be
permitted. All surfaces shall be finished to match nearly as possible the
adjacent surfaces. Wearing surface less than two (2) feet in width to curbs
resulting from excavation shall be removed and replaced.
Concrete Sidewalk
This item shall consist of removal and replacement of concrete sidewalk
necessary for the installation of the sanitary house service connection.
Materials used in the concrete sidewalk mix shall conform to the ODOT item
“608.03” for concrete sidewalks.
Sandstone and Limestone Sidewalk
Where sandstone and limestone sidewalks are encountered all reasonable effort
must be taken to protect these items. Temporary removal to allow excavation is
encouraged. When stones are replaced they must be set in a stable non-settling
base and in their original positions.
Septic Tank Demolition
The homeowner shall be responsible for arranging to completely empty (clean)
existing tanks and dispose of septage in a legal manner. The contractor shall
demolish the top and walls of the existing septic tanks to at least one foot
below grade, and backfill the resulting void to a level 1 foot below the
original ground line with approved excavated material. The following material
may be used for septic tank backfill: #57 or #8 crushed stone, sand, or ODOT
210. Demolition of septic tanks must be done in such a manner as to minimize
voids, pockets, or any other condition that would lead to settling problems.
The Contractor shall locate and open septic tanks soon enough before hookup
work begins to allow smooth coordination of emptying.
Unless the homeowner requests (in writing) otherwise, the working mechanisms of
aerators are to be removed and disposed of by the contractor prior to
demolition and backfilling. The electrical power to all aerators are to be
disconnected prior to any work and terminated as to prevent a safety hazard.
Safety
At all times working conditions must be maintained. All excavations left
unattended shall be covered or barricaded to prevent mishaps. Equipment not in
use shall be parked away from the right-of-ways and streets.
Stockpiling of Material
No construction material may be stored on Village right-of-ways. All stored
material must remain entirely on the homeowners’ property and be removed by the
end of construction.

1113.11 TREE PRESERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (a)   Statement of Intent. Trees are an essential element of the rural-
village character of Shawnee Hills as defined in the Long Range Master Plan for
land use. Trees are also important to the Village as they contribute to
stormwater management, reduce erosion and provide habitat for wildlife.
Therefore, it is the intention of the Village to preserve healthy trees over 6"
in diameter when measured 24" from the ground. It is the intent of this section
to promote and protect public safety, convenience, comfort, prosperity and
general welfare of the Village.
(Ord. 13-97. Passed 6-9-97.)
   (b)    Trees Affected by the Tree Preservation Overlay District. All trees
over 6" in diameter when measured 24" from the ground shall not be cut down or
otherwise be compromised for any reason without written approval from the
Village Administrator and/or his/her designee, with advise from the Village
Forester or written approval from the Planning and Zoning Board according to
the procedure described in this section.
(Ord. 20-2010. Passed 10-25-10.)
   (c)   Area of Applicability. The Tree Preservation Overlay District is to
cover all areas of the Village in order to protect the aesthetic and
environmental significance of the trees in all of the Village’s Zoning
Districts.
(Ord. 13-97. Passed 6-9-97.)
   (d)   Authority for Village Decisions Affecting Trees on Public and Private
Property. The Village Administrator and/or his/her designee, with advice from
the Village Forester, shall have the authority to approve or prohibit
activities related to and affecting trees within the Tree Preservation Overlay
District.
   (e)   Procedures for Obtaining Approval for Removing, Pruning, or Relocating
a Tree.
      (1)   Subject to the process described herein and the determination(s)
set forth in subsection (g)(2) below, the decisions to treat, remove, or retain
trees on private property shall be the property owner's. Property Owners should
consider many variables when evaluating options, including tree size, location,
and condition; access to the tree; potential targets should the tree fall;
property value; shade, heating and cooling values; treatment techniques,
efficacy, and costs' proximity of EAB infestation; and intangible costs. Anyone
wishing to remove (cut down), prune (the shortening or removal of any tree limb
greater than twelve inches in diameter as measured at any location on the
limb), relocate or otherwise compromise the welfare of a tree as defined in the
Tree Preservation Overlay District shall notify the Village Administrator of
his or her plans prior to commencing any activity affecting the tree(s).
      (2)   The Village Administrator and/or his/her designee and the Village
Forester shall meet with the person(s) wishing to remove, prune, relocate or
otherwise compromise a tree and personally visit the site. The Village Forester
shall review construction plans and other plans related to removing, pruning,
or moving trees.
      (3)   If, after discussing the removal, pruning, or relocation of any
tree within the Village with the Village Forester and the property owner, the
Village Administrator believes the removal, pruning, and/or relocation of a
tree is necessary and reasonable, he or she shall provide written authorization
for pruning, relocating, or removing any tree within the Village to the
property owner and to the Planning and Zoning Board within fifteen days of the
applicant's request for review under this section.
      (4)   Village residents may address their opinions regarding any tree-
related plans to the Village Administrator and/or Village Forester.
      (5)   Decisions of the Village Administrator made under this Section
shall be appealable to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
         (Ord. 20-2010. Passed 10-25-10.)
   (f)   Tree Topping Prohibited. No trees shall be topped. Topping is the
removal of the upper portion (from one-quarter to one-half) of a tree.
(Ord. 13-97. Passed 6-9-97.)
   (g)    Removal and Replacement of Diseased, Dead or Damaged Trees; Trees
that Interfere with Public Utilities and other Improvements.
      (1)   Trees that are diseased, dead or damaged by forces of nature, such
as storms and high winds, may be removed with the approval of the Village
Administrator and/or his/her designee. All diseased, dead or damaged trees that
are removed with the Village Administrator's and/or his/her designee's approval
must be replaced by the property owner with a tree of at least 2" in diameter
measure 24" from the ground and be of a species approved by the Village
Forester.
      (2)   Any tree or parts thereof, which the Village Administrator, with
the advice of the Village Forester, has determined is diseased, dangerous,
causing damage to, or obstructing any sewer line, electric power line, gas
line, water line, or other public improvement, shall be removed upon the
written notice of the Village Administrator and/or his/her designee. If any
tree(s) are suspect of being infected with emerald ash borer or any other
disease/insect must first be positively identified by the Village Forester.
Once so identified, the tree must be immediately treated or removed. The
Village Administrator and/or his/her designee shall give to the property owner
written notice of the determination and an order to remove or treat said tree
within thirty (30) days. Should the property owner fail to comply with a
removal order within the specified time, upon approval of the Village Council,
the Village Administrator may employ the necessary labor and equipment to
perform such task, together with any cleanup work required. Any expenses
incurred shall, when approved by Council, be paid out of any money in the
treasury of the Village not otherwise appropriated. It shall be lawful for the
Village, its employees, or agents to enter the property to remove such trees
and to bill the property owner for the actual cost of the work performed. If
such charges are not paid within thirty days after mailing of the notice, then
the council shall make a written return to the County Auditor of its action
under this chapter, with a statement of the approved charges, the amount paid
for the performing of labor, the fees of the officers who made the services of
the notice and return and a proper description of the premises be entered upon

General Fund.
      (3)   Trees removed for any non-emergency reason without review and
written approval by the Village Administrator and/or his/her designee, as
discussed in paragraph (e) above, will result in penalties as later described
in this section. An emergency for the purposes of this section is a situation
in which there is an immediate threat to life or property due to a sudden
circumstance.

from Asia, was identified in Ohio in 2003.
         A.   There are numerous ash trees within the Village of Shawnee Hills,
and currently no formal inventory exists. Ash density varies by street.
However, the Emerald Ash Borer has been found in the Village.
         B.   The best way to control against the insect is through education,
the proper identification of its presence and the proper disposal of infested
wood. Property owners are urged to monitor the EAB's movements and to contact
the Village Forester with questions via the Village Office.
(Ord. 20-2010. Passed 10-25-10.)
   (h)   New Construction Around Trees.
      (1)   Before any site clearing or other construction activity begins, all
trees, either individually or as a group or groups, shall be enclosed with at
least three foot high orange construction fencing to prevent any access to the
tree(s). Unless otherwise approved by the Village Forester. Fencing should be
placed six feet from the base of the tree. Such fencing shall not be removed
until the construction is complete. Such trees to which this section applies
shall not be disturbed any time before or after construction except for
necessary access as approved by the Village Forester.
      (2)   No development, clearing, construction or work shall be performed
within six feet of trees protected by this section except as deemed necessary
by the Village Forester. If a tree or trees are disturbed at any time,
including but not limited to utility construction and/or easement, building or
grading construction, by the developer, such disturbances that occur shall be
restored to a condition approved by the Village Forester.
      (3)   All construction projects within six feet of a tree shall be
conducted with evidence that the following elements are being monitored in
regard to the welfare of the tree(s).

Building Inspector may place a stop work order on the construction until such
time as the Village Forester has approved remedial measures bringing the
construction activity into compliance with this section.
      (2)   Violations of this section shall be calculated and fines shall be
assessed on a per tree basis.
      (3)   Any resident or other person who violated any provisions of this
section or fails to comply with any of its requirements, including violations
of conditions and safeguards established in connection with this section,
shall, upon conviction thereof, be found guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall be subject to a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) and, in

1117.01 CONFLICT.
   Planned Unit Development Zoning Districts may be established by application
in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the requirements
contained herein which shall take precedence over all other conflicting
regulations contained in the Zoning Code and/or platting ordinances. (Ord. 12-
2015. Passed 4-27-15.)
1117.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is established as an optional
development tool to permit flexibility in the regulation of land development;
to encourage innovation in land use, form of ownership and variety of design,
layout and type of structures constructed; to achieve economy and efficiency in
the use of land; to preserve significant natural, historical and architectural
features and open space; to promote efficient provision of public services and
utilities; to minimize adverse traffic impacts; to provide better housing,
employment and business opportunities particularly suited to residents; to
encourage development of convenient recreational facilities; and to encourage
the use and improvement of existing sites when the uniform regulations
contained in other zoning districts alone do not provide adequate protection
and safeguards for the property and surrounding areas. It is the further intent
of the PUD regulations to promote a higher quality of development than can be
achieved from conventional zoning requirements in furtherance of the vision and
goals of the Village of Shawnee Hills. (Ord. 12-2015. Passed 4-27-15.)
1117.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   "Planned Unit Development (PUD)." A "PUD" means an area of land in which one
use or a variety of uses may be accommodated in a pre-planned environment under
more flexible standards than those restrictions that would normally apply under
this Zoning Code. The process in a PUD shall consist of a Preliminary
Development Plan which shall constitute the act of zoning; and a Final
Development Plan which shall consist of a detailed development plan for all, a
portion of the area, or subareas within the Preliminary Development Plan.
(Ord. 12-2015. Passed 4-27-15.)
1117.04 USES.
   Within the Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zoning District, permitted uses
shall include all uses allowable under the Zoning Code or a compatible
combination of any or all of these uses provided the proposed location of any
of the uses will not adversely affect adjacent property and/or public health,
safety and general welfare. All zoning requirements for the PUD applicable to
the proposed use shall be applicable to all uses in the PUD, unless modified in
accordance with Section
1117.05.
(Ord. 12-2015. Passed 4-27-15.)
1117.05 MODIFICATION OF MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   District regulations applicable to a land use in the PUD may be
altered from the requirements set forth in the Zoning Code, including but not
limited to, lot width, building setbacks, height, lot coverage, signs, and
parking. The PUD applicant shall identify, in the Preliminary and Final
Development Plans, all intended and needed deviations from the zoning
requirements. Modifications may be approved by the Village Council during the
preliminary plan review stage, after Planning Commission approval and
recommendation. These modifications will be permitted only if they result in a
higher quality and more sustainable development consistent with the purpose of
this Chapter.
   (b)   In addition to these modifications of minimum requirements, Village
Council, after Planning Commission approval and recommendation, may permit an
increase in the total number of residential units allowed with the PUD where it
is demonstrated the PUD:
      (1)   Uses low-impact design and or best practices design principles to
minimize storm water run-off;
      (2)   Preserves the best natural features of the site;
      (3)   Creates, improves, or maintains open space for the residents,
employees, and other visitors to the PUD; and
      (4)   Contains at least 20% of the area as preserved open space. If the
site contains, or is adjacent to a river, stream, or other body of water, the
Village may require that all, or a portion of, the open space abut the river,
stream, or body of water. (Ord. 12-2015. Passed 4-27-15.)
1117.06 GENERAL PROCEDURES.
   Procedures and conditions set forth for determination of Planned Unit
Development Districts and development(s) therein shall be strictly followed
except when the Planning Commission and Council have approved a written
statement submitted with the rezoning application, by the applicant clearly
showing that such procedures or conditions do not apply in the specific case.
(Ord. 12-2015. Passed 4-27-15.)
1117.07 OWNERSHIP.
   A Planned Unit Development shall be in joint or common ownership or control
at the time the rezoning application is made for a Planned Unit Development
District, or where joint or common ownership and/or control does not exist,
each owner within the Planned Unit Development shall sign the application for
rezoning. Any transfer of land within the Development resulting in ownership
within the development by two or more parties after an application has been
filed shall not alter the applicability of the regulations contained herein. A
Development Plan approved hereunder shall be binding upon the applicant(s),
their successors and assigns and shall limit and control the issuance of
validity of all Certificates of Zoning approval.

1117.10  PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD).
   The following procedures shall be used to secure approval of a Planned Unit
Development (PUD) and the appropriate changes of zoning resulting therefrom.
   (a)    The Preliminary Development Plan together with an application and
application fee shall be filed with the Code Enforcement Officer. The
Preliminary Development Plan and accompanying documents shall then be forwarded
to the Planning Commission for study and recommendation. Copies of the
Preliminary Development Plan also shall be forwarded to the Municipal Engineer,
Code Enforcement Officer, and Village Administrator for a comprehensive staff
report, which report shall have been received and reviewed by the Planning
Commission prior to the Commission's recommendations being made to Council.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall have a reasonable time, not less than
thirty (30) days, to consider the Preliminary Development Plan at a public
hearing and to report its recommendations to Council. The Code Enforcement
Officer, or his designee, shall notify all owners of neighboring properties as
set out in the applicant's affidavit, of the time and place of the Commission's
public hearing at which such Preliminary Development Plan will be considered.
Such notices shall be served by first class mail posted at least ten (10) days
before the date of the proposed public hearing.
      When Council receives the Planning Commission's report and
recommendation, Council shall establish a date for public hearing on the
Preliminary Development Plan, giving notice in accordance with the provisions
of Section
1129.04. Such public hearing by Council shall be held within ninety (90) days
after the receipt of the Planning Commission's report and recommendation unless
such time period is extended by mutual agreement of the parties.
      The Planning Commission's report and recommendation on the Preliminary
Development Plan, as well as the Preliminary Development Plan and a draft
rezoning ordinance, shall be available for public inspection for the period of
thirty (30) days immediately preceding Council's public hearing. Adoption of
the ordinance including the Preliminary Development Plan shall constitute a
rezoning of the property included in the Preliminary Development Plan subject
to the applicant's compliance with the provisions of subsections (c) through
(f) hereof prior to the development or the construction of improvements
contained in the preliminary plan and any conditions established by Council.
   (c)   Within two (2) years following Council's approval of the Preliminary
Development Plan, a Final Development Plan may be submitted for all or any part
of the approved Preliminary Development Plan. Upon good cause shown by the
applicant and by a majority vote of the Planning Commission, the Commission may
extend the two-year period if the request is submitted prior to the expiration
date. Failure to submit a Final Development Plan within such two-year period
(or any such extended period) and then have it approved timely thereafter shall
invalidate any prior zoning approval given, forfeit fee payments, and revert
the property to its previous zoning classification.
      Final Development Plans are intended to be detailed representations of
and in conformance with all aspects of the approved Preliminary Development
Plan. Following receipt of a Final Development Plan and accompanying documents
from the Code Enforcement Officer, the Planning Commission shall review such
plan and determine whether it complies with regulations of this chapter, that
it represents a detailed and precise expansion and delineation of the
previously approved Preliminary Development Plan, that it complies with all
conditions which may have been given at the time of approval of the Preliminary
Development Plan, or that before it can be considered, it requires an amendment
of the Preliminary Development Plan.
      No details of any Final Development Plan shall necessitate revision of
portions of the approved Preliminary Development Plan. If revision of any
portion of the Preliminary Development Plan is required, a revised Preliminary
Development Plan shall be approved by the Planning Commission in accordance
with the provisions of this Code before approval is granted to the Final
Development Plan. Council shall be required to approve the change at a public
hearing for which notice shall be given in conformance with Section
1129.04.
      The Code Enforcement Officer, or his designee, shall notify all owners of
neighboring properties as set out in the applicant's affidavit, of the time and
place of the Commission's public hearing at which such Final Development Plan
will be considered. Such notices shall be served by first class mail posted at
least ten (10) days before the date of the proposed hearing. (Ord. 29-2022.
Passed 1-23-22.)
   (d)   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Former subsection (d) was repealed by Ordinance 29-
2022, passed January 23, 2023.)
   (e)   If the Planning Commission finds that the Final Development Plan
complies in all respects with the regulations of this chapter and the
previously approved Preliminary Development Plan, the Commission shall approve
the plan and the Commission chair, vice chair or designee shall affix his/her
signature and approval date thereto attesting to such approval. Following
approval of the Final Development Plan and the attestation of such action by
the Commission chair, vice chair or designee, the applicant shall provide one
copy of all plans as part of the Final Development Plan for records of the
Village.
   (f)   A final subdivision plat prepared in accordance with applicable
requirements of the subdivision regulations for the area covered by the Final
Development Plan shall be prepared for Council approval prior to appropriate
recording.
      (Ord. 12-2015. Passed 4-27-15.)
1117.11 RECORDING AND TRANSFER.
   When a final plat is approved by Council, the owner shall file and record
the same in the Office of the County Recorder within 12 months unless such time
is, for good cause shown, extended by resolution of Council. If not recorded
within this time, the approval of Council shall become null and void. If
construction is not begun within two years of approval of the Final Development
Plan, all approvals and permits shall be invalidated and canceled. Original
tracings will become the permanent record of the County Recorder. One copy of
this tracing, showing the date and place of recording, shall be supplied by the
owner to Council as local public records. Such two year period may be extended
by the Commission for good cause.
(Ord. 12-2015. Passed 4-27-15.)
1117.12 AMENDMENTS TO PUD.
   Amendments to an approved PUD, whether under this Chapter or former Section
1113.12, shall be permitted only under the following circumstances:
   (a)   Notify Code Enforcement Officer. The holder of an approved PUD
preliminary and/or final development plan shall notify the Code Enforcement
Officer of any desired amendment to the PUD.
   (b)   Minor Change Determination. Minor changes may be approved by the Code
Enforcement Officer upon determining the proposed amendment(s) will not alter
the basic design and character of the PUD, nor any specified modifications
imposed as part of the original approval. Minor changes shall include, but are
not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Reduction of the size of any building and/or sign;
      (2)   Movement of buildings and/or signs by no more than ten feet;
      (3)   Landscaping approved in the final development plan that is replaced
by similar landscaping to an equal or greater extent;
      (4)   Changes in floor plans which do not alter the exterior of the
building, character of the use, or increase the amount of required parking;
      (5)   Internal rearrangement of a parking lot that does not affect the
number of parking spaces or alter access locations or design; or
      (6)   Changes required or requested by the Village or other county, state
or federal regulatory agency in order to conform to other laws or regulations.
   (c)   Major Change Determination. A proposed change determined by the Code
Enforcement Officer to be a major, not minor, shall be submitted as an
amendment to the PUD and shall be processed in the same manner as the original
PUD application for the preliminary and/or final development plan.
      (Ord. 21-2015. Passed 7-29-15.)
1117.13 APPEAL.
   If the Planning Commission disapproves the Final Development Plan, the
applicant shall have thirty (30) days in which to file an appeal with the
Council for review. Such appeal shall be in writing, filed within thirty (30)
days of the disapproval, and shall be filed with the Code Enforcement Officer.
Council shall then act within a reasonable time. Council cannot reverse or
modify Planning Commission's decision without a vote of three-fourth of its
members.

1121.04 LANDSCAPING.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the landscaping regulations shall be to
promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare through the
preservation and protection of the environment by recognizing the vital
importance of tree growth to the ecological system. It is further the purpose
of this section to specifically promote the preservation and replacement of
trees and major vegetation removed in the course of land development, and to
promote the proper utilization of landscaping as a buffer between certain land
uses to minimize the possibility of nuisances. Through the proper use of
landscaping, nuisances can be avoided between abutting land uses and
distractions eliminated for traffic passing by and through a particular use.
For the purpose of this Zoning Ordinance, "landscaping" means the treatment of
the ground surface with natural greenery and plant material, including seeding
and sod.
   (b)   Plan.
      (1)   All applications for a subdivision, zoning permit, variance,
conditional use permit or in other such cases where a site plan or development
plan is to be filed, a landscape plan must be shown. The owner or applicant
shall indicate and show proof of preserving major vegetation either by
generally locating major tree growth as related to development and construction
plans on the landscape plan or boundary survey or by tree spot as determined by
the Village Mayor or his designee.
      (2)   All trees having a trunk diameter of six inches or greater as
measured twenty-four inches from the ground level shall be preserved unless
such trees are exempted as follows:
         A.   Trees within public rights-of-way or utility easements, which
impair use of the easement.
         B.   Trees within the ground coverage of proposed structures or within
twelve feet from the perimeter of such structure(s).
         C.   Trees within the driveway to service a single-family home.
         D.   Trees that in the judgment of the Village Mayor or his designee
are damaged, diseased, which interfere with utility lines or are an
inappropriate or undesirable species for that specific location.
   It is encouraged that exempted trees subject to destruction are preserved by
relocation and replanting of such trees on a lot.
      (3)   For new development or construction, if new tree plantings are
required for conformance to the landscaping requirements of this section, the
applicant or owner shall indicate on the landscape plan the location and size
of such tree plantings. If such landscape plan is approved by the Village Mayor
or his designee, the applicant or owner shall plant such trees as may be
required within one year after the issuance of a building permit.
   (c)   Screening Requirements.
      (1)   Screening of service courts and loading dock areas.
         A.   For applicable uses under the commercial and industrial districts
both planned and standard all areas used for service, loading and unloading
activities shall be adequately screened if adjacent to or abutting a
residential district.
         B.   Such screening can consist of walls, fence structures,
landscaping or, an acceptable combination of these elements, provided that the
height of any wall or fence structure is at minimum seven feet and at maximum
twelve feet.
         C.   Such screening shall cover a minimum of seventy-five percent
(75%) of the area of the visual face formed by the property line between
adjacent residential uses extended vertically to a height of nine feet from
ground level, and extended horizontally between the side lot lines of the
property. In addition, such screening, during full foliage, shall have a
minimum opaqueness of seventy-five percent (75%).The use of year round
vegetation, shall be no closer than three feet to any property line.
      (2)   Screening of trash containers; receptacles.
         A.   For applicable uses under the commercial and industrial district,
both planned and standard, all trash containers or receptacles shall be
sufficiently screened or enclosed. Trash containers designed to service more
than one residential unit or to service a non-residential restructure or
structures shall be screened by walls, a fence structure or landscaping or an
acceptable combination of these elements.
         B.   The height of such walls, fence structures of landscaping shall
be a minimum of six feet. The maximum height of walls and fence structures
shall not exceed ten feet. All screening, during full foliage, shall have a
minimum opaqueness of eighty percent (80%). The use of year round vegetation
such as pines or evergreens is encouraged.
         C.   For every six inch tree removed in the course of development or
construction that is otherwise not exempted from regulation, the owner or
applicant shall plant a tree having a trunk diameter of no less than one and
one half inches within one year from the date a building permit was granted.
For every six inch tree removed, and if no replacement trees are planted within
this one year period, the Village Mayor or his designee may find the owner or
applicant in violation of this chapter and assess a fine of fifty dollars
($50.00) per violation. Such fee shall be used by the Village to plant trees on
public property or rights of way. In the case of dispute between the applicant
or owner and the Village Forester relative to whether a specific tree is
exempted or non-exempted from these regulations, the Village Mayor or his
designee may require that an accurate tree spot be made by the applicant for
determination of violation.
   (d)   Standards.
      (1)   Preservation of wooded areas. It is encouraged that efforts be made
to preserve natural vegetation areas. Consideration shall be given to laying
out streets, lots, structures and parking areas to avoid the unnecessary
destruction of heavily wooded areas or outstanding tree specimens. It is
further encouraged that whenever possible, heavily wooded areas be designated
as park reserves.
      (2)   Tree planting requirements. For all new development the following
landscape requirements shall apply:

1128.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.
   (b)   Findings of Fact. Although the Village of Shawnee Hills does not have
any special flood hazard areas identified at this time that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base; the Village wants to update its flood damage reduction regulations so
that it is better prepared in case an emergency arises and be eligible to
receive federal funds. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the
flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the
purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
 
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Shawnee Hills as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by Village of Shawnee Hills.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map for Delaware County, Ohio and incorporated
areas and the Flood Insurance Study for Delaware County, Ohio and incorporated
areas both effective April 16, 2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Shawnee Hills as required by Section
1128.04(e) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Municipal Building, 40 W Reindeer Dr., Shawnee
Hills, Ohio 43065.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Shawnee Hills, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 05-2009. Passed 3-23-09.)
1128.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter for
these regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have
in common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,

filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zone: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Village of Shawnee Hills's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the "Start of Construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Shawnee
Hills Flood Insurance Rate Map, April 16, 2009, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets

such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the
Village of Shawnee Hills, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Shawnee Hills have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Shawnee Hills' Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the
Village of Shawnee Hills boundaries, include within such notification a copy of
a map of the Village of Shawnee Hills suitable for reproduction, clearly
showing the new corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of
Shawnee Hills has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory
authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1128.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board for a public hearing
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the Village of
Shawnee Hills.
      (2)   Public Hearing.  
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in practical difficulties due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (3)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(2)1. to 11. have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeals to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
      (4)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g. water, sewer, garbage, etc.);
      (5)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restrictions;
      (6)   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated

met.
         B.   The proposed development is in accord with appropriate plans for
the area.
         C.   The proposed development will be in keeping with the existing
land use character and physical development potential of the area.

the Zoning District and the applicable Development Standards are met, but plot
plan modification is required:
            1.   To be in accord with appropriate plan for the area.
            2.   To prevent undesirable effects on adjacent property and the
surrounding area.
         B.   Such modification may be a limitation on the extent or intensity
of development, a requirement for additional screening by fence or landscaping,
a change in the method or plan for lighting, control of access, or other
conditions of development as may be required. Recommendations regarding the
modification of plans or other appropriate actions shall be stated with the
reasons for each recommendation.
      (4)   Disapproval. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall only disapprove an
application for a Conditional Use for any one of the following reasons:
         A.   The proposed use is not a Conditional Use of the Zoning District,
or the applicable Development Standards are not and cannot be met.
         B.   The proposed development is not in accord with appropriate plans
of the area.
         C.   The proposed development will have undesirable effects on the
surrounding area and is not in keeping with the existing land use character and

      B.   "Variance" means a modification of the literal provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance granted when strict enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance would
cause undue hardship owing to circumstances unique to the individual property
on which the variance is granted. The crucial points of a variance are undue
hardship and unique circumstances. A variance is not justified unless both
elements are present in the case. The "Conditional Use" differs from the
"variance" in several respects. A conditional use does not require "undue
hardship" in order to be allowable. The conditional uses that are found in this
Zoning Ordinance appeal as "special approval" or review by the Planning
Commission. These land uses could not be logically allocated to one zone or
another, or the effects of such uses could not be definitely foreseen as of a
given time.
   (120)   "Zero lot line" means a condition where regulations for side yards
can be modified or waived under the Planned Unit Development District to allow
two structures or dwellings to share a common wall that is placed on the side
lot line that separates two individual lots in a subdivided plat.
   (121)   "Zoning Certificate" means an official statement certifying that a
proposed building or use complies with all the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (122)   "Zoning District" is a portion of the incorporated area of the
Village within which certain regulations and requirements or various
combinations thereof apply under the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (123)   "Zoning District Map" means the Zoning District Map or maps of the
Village, together with all amendments subsequently adopted by Ordinance.
   (124)   "Zoning Permit" means a document issued by the Building Inspector
authorizing the use of lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and the
characteristics of the uses.
   (125)   "Zoning Ordinance" refers to the Zoning Ordinance of the Village of
Shawnee Hills, Ohio.

Village employee(s) that the building is vacant.
   (b)    Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to establish a program for

determine the responsibilities of owners of vacant buildings, to speed the
rehabilitation of vacant buildings, and to shift the cost burden from the
general Village residents to the owners of vacant buildings.
(Ord. 22-2018. Passed 9-10-18.)
   (c)    Vacant Building Registration.
      (1)   The owner shall register with the Code Enforcement Officer not
later than 90 days after any building located in an area zoned for, or abutting
an area zoned for, residential or commercial use in the Village becomes a
vacant building or not later than 30 days of being notified by the Code
Enforcement Officer of the requirement to register based on evidence of
vacancy, whichever event occurs first. For the purposes of this registration,
the Owner must register separately each part and/or address of building which
is unoccupied and/or unsecured, and this registration must be made annually
thereafter if the vacant building status continues. The registration shall be
accompanied by the applicable vacant building fee.
         (Ord. 08-2019. Passed 5-13-19.)
      (2)   The registration shall be submitted on forms provided by the Code

relating to the property and conformance to all requirements under this
chapter;
         C.   The names and addresses of all known lien holders and all other

      (3)   The owner shall submit a vacant building plan which must meet the
approval of the Code Enforcement Officer. The plan, at a minimum, must contain
information from one of the following three choices:
         A.   If the building is to be demolished, a demolition plan indicating
the proposed time frame for demolition which includes starting within 30 days
of acceptance of the proposed demolition timeline and does not exceed one year
in accordance with the Ohio Building Code; or
         B.   If the building is to remain vacant, a plan for ensuring the
building is secured along with the procedure that will be used to maintain the
property, and a statement of the reasons why the building will be left vacant
(e.g., building is for sale, etc.); or
         C.   If the building is to be returned to appropriate occupancy or
use, a rehabilitation plan for the building and grounds. The rehabilitation
plan shall not exceed 12 months from the time the owner obtains permits, unless
the Code Enforcement Officer grants an extension upon receipt of a written
statement from the owner detailing the reasons for the extension. Any repairs,
improvements or alterations to the property must comply with any applicable
zoning, housing, historic preservation, or building codes and the property must
be secured during the rehabilitation.
      (4)   All applicable laws and codes shall be complied with by the owner.
The owner shall notify the Code Enforcement Officer of any changes in
information of their vacant building registration within 30 days of the change.

revision(s) must be in writing and must be approved in writing by the Code
Enforcement Officer.
      (5)   The owner and subsequent owner shall keep the building secured and
safe and the building and grounds properly maintained in accordance with all
applicable property maintenance codes.
      (6)   Any new owner shall register or re-register the vacant building
with the Code Enforcement Officer within 30 days of any transfer of an
ownership interest in the vacant building if the building continues to remain
vacant after transfer. The new owner shall comply with the approved plan and
timetable submitted by the previous owner until any proposed changes are
submitted and are approved by the Code Enforcement Officer.
      (7)   The failure of the owner of the vacant building to obtain a deed
for the property or to file the deed with the County Recorder shall not excuse
the property owner from registering the vacant building under this section.
      (8)   The registration process under this section must be completed
annually for every vacant building for as long as the building remains vacant.
   (d)    Escrow.  Each demolition of a vacant building requires that the owner
hold in escrow with the Village a deposit of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for
a residential building and seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) for a
commercial building. If the amount to be set up in escrow cannot be paid in
full, the Village will place a lien on the property for the amount previously
specified. The Village will use these funds to demolish the building/dwelling
if it is not completed by the property owner. Escrow funds will be released
upon completion of the work or transfer of ownership, provided that all fees
have been paid in full. New owners must sign a form accepting responsibility
for completing the demolition.
   (e)    Inspections. The Code Enforcement Officer shall inspect any premises
in the Village for the purpose of enforcing and assuring compliance with the
provisions of this section. Upon the request of the Code Enforcement Officer,
an owner may provide access to all interior portions of an unoccupied building
in order to permit a complete inspection. Nothing contained herein, however,
shall diminish the owner's right to insist upon the procurement of a search
warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction by the Code Enforcement Officer
in order to enable such inspection. The Code Enforcement Officer shall be
required to obtain a search warrant whenever an owner refuses to permit a
warrantless inspection of the premises. The following shall apply:
      (1)   Vacant properties will be externally inspected by the Code
Enforcement Officer a minimum of twice per year to ensure compliance with
property maintenance codes;
      (2)   Vacant properties will be both internally and externally inspected
at the start of each registration period (new and renewal) and when the
registration is terminated by the property owner;
      (3)   Vacant properties will be both internally and externally inspected
upon acquisition of the property by a new owner;
      (4)   The timing and frequency of inspections in addition to those listed
under this section shall be conducted at the sole discretion of the Code
Enforcement Officer.
   (f)    Vacant Building Fees. The fees established herein shall be reasonably
related to the administrative costs for registering and processing the vacant
building owner registration form and for the costs incurred by the Village in
monitoring the vacant building site. The annually increased fee amounts shall
be reasonably related to the costs incurred by the Village for demolition and
hazard abatement of or repairs to vacant buildings, as well as the continued
normal administrative costs stated above.
(Ord. 22-2018. Passed 9-10-18.)
      (1)   The owner of a vacant residential building shall pay a fee of two
hundred dollars ($200.00) for each residential unit with the building which is
unoccupied and/or unsecured for the first year. For every consecutive year that
the building remains vacant thereafter, the fee for each residential unit that
is vacant will be assessed at double the previous year's fee amount for a
maximum annual fee equaling the five-year fee of three thousand two hundred
dollars ($3,200.00) to be used for the fifth and for all consecutive,
subsequent years of vacancy.

hundred dollars ($400.00) for each part and/or address of building which is
unoccupied and/or unsecured, for the first year. For every consecutive year

which is unoccupied and/or unsecured will be assessed at double the previous
year's fee for a maximum annual fee equaling the five-year fee of six thousand
four hundred dollars ($6,400.00) to be used for the fifth and for all
consecutive, subsequent years of vacancy.
         (Ord. 08-2019. Passed 5-13-19.)
      (3)   The first annual fee shall be paid at the time the building is
registered. If the fee is not paid, the owner shall be subject to late fees
assessed under this section and applicable penalties under this chapter.
      (4)   The fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any building
permits unless the property is granted an exemption by the Code Enforcement
Officer. The fee shall be prorated and a refund may be issued if the building
is no longer deemed vacant under the provisions of this section within 180 days
of its registration.
      (5)   All delinquent fees shall be paid by the owner prior to any
transfer of an ownership interest in the vacant building. A lien may be placed
on the property to collect delinquent fees.
      (6)   Late fees shall be paid in addition to the annual registration fee
and shall be equal to one-fourth of the applicable annual fee amount.
   (g)   Exemptions.
       (1)   A building under active construction/renovation and having a valid
building permit(s) shall be exempt from registration until the expiration of
the longest running, currently active building permit.
      (2)   A building which has suffered fire damage or damage caused by
extreme weather conditions shall be exempt from the registration requirement
for a period of 90 days after the date of the fire or extreme weather event if
the property owner submits a request for exemption in writing to the Code
Enforcement Officer. This request shall include the name and address of the
owner, and a statement of intent to repair and reoccupy the building in an
expedient manner or intent to demolish the building.
      (3)   A building that is for sale and listed with a licensed State of
Ohio realtor shall be exempted for a period of 7 months from the start of
vacancy, provided that the owner submits proof to the Code Enforcement Officer
of such listing and "for sale" status.
      (4)   Any owner of a vacant building may request an exemption from the
provisions of this section by filing a written application with the Code
Enforcement Officer who shall timely consider same. In determining whether a
request for exemption should be granted, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
consider the following: the applicant's prior record as it pertains to any
violations of the Village's Building Code; the amount of vacant property the
applicant currently has within the Village; and the length of time that the
building for which the exemption is sought has been vacant.
   (h)    Appeals.  Any owner who is served a notice requiring vacant property
registration may, within 10 calendar days of receipt of such notice, apply for
an exemption under this section or appeal the findings of the Code Enforcement
Officer as set forth under Section
1307.11.
