   AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE AND ADOPT THE 2006 TROY CODIFIED ORDINANCES
   WHEREAS, a determination has been made that the ordinances of the City of
Troy, Ohio of a permanent and general nature should be recodified, and
   WHEREAS, the City has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish such recodification, and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the City of Troy, Ohio, as
follows:
   SECTION I. That the ordinances of the City of Troy, Ohio, of a general and
permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the City of Troy, Ohio 2005.
   SECTION II. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section V of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to July 18, 2005, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance. However, the enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be
construed to affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any
legislation provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an
action or proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such
enactment shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an
act committed in violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an
indictment or prosecution thereof. For such purposes, any such legislative
provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and recodification.
   SECTION III. That each section of the Codified Ordinances without an
ordinance or resolution history at the end thereof indicates that the section
contains new material which is hereby enacted by this adopting ordinance. A
summary of new material contained in the Codified Ordinances shall be published
by the Clerk of Council.
   SECTION IV. That through authentication and approval of this Ordinance the
Mayor and Clerk of Council shall certify that the permanent and general
ordinances of the Municipality as codified herein are correctly set forth and
constitute the Codified Ordinances of the City of Troy, Ohio, 2005.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Troy was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Troy Codified Ordinances is indicated.

originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action

   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.09 DATES OF HOLIDAYS.

   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is

probationary periods (original and promotional) shall be subject to the rules

(Ord. 42-2012. Passed 12-17-12.)

141.04  GROUP LIFE INSURANCE.
   The City, in addition to the salaries and benefits set forth in the
compensation ordinances, shall pay all premiums for fifty thousand dollars
($50,000) worth of group life insurance per employee. Such life insurance

benefits as provided by the insurance carrier. Such life insurance program
shall be subject to any conditions imposed by the carrier over which the City
has no control.
(Ord. 42-2012. Passed 12-17-12.)
 
141.05  HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFIT; DENTAL PLAN BENEFIT.
   (a)    Health Insurance. The City, in addition to the salaries and wages set
forth in compensation ordinances, shall provide group health insurance coverage
for the benefit of its employees with a carrier as selected by the City. Such
insurance shall be subject to conditions imposed by the carrier over which the
City has no control. The plan selected shall be known as the standard plan.
      (1)   The Director of Public Service and Safety is authorized to contract
with a third party to administer health savings accounts or health
reimbursement accounts.
      (2)   The current Insurance plans and employee contribution rates will
continue unchanged through August 31, 2022, except the City will make an
additional one-time contribution of $500 single and $1000 family to the Health
Savings Account of employees on the Standard Plan during the plan year
beginning September 1, 2021.
      (3)   Effective September 1, 2022, the City will make available to
employees the same health insurance options as the City makes available to the
Director of Public Service and Safety and to other non-represented employees,
provided that, for employees participating in a High Deductible Health Plan,
the City will contribute a minimum of 25% of the deductible to the. Health
Savings Account of employees for the plan years beginning September 1, 2022,
September 1, 2023 and September 1, 2024.
      (4)   The City will, for each insurance year, maintain the Standard Plan
in place the previous insurance year so long as the per-employee premium cost
does not increase more than the percentage increase in the statewide cost of a
family insurance plan as reported by SERB in its most recent (as of April 1)
report on health care costs in Ohio's public sector. If the increase would be
more than the percentage increase derived from the SERB report, the City may
select a different plan as the City's Standard Plan which will keep the
increase from exceeding the percentage increase derived from the SERB report
while keeping coverage as comparable as possible.
      (5)   Employees shall pay 13% of the health insurance premium for the
standard plan for the plan year beginning September 1, 2022. 14% of the health
insurance premium for the standard plan for the plan year beginning September
1, 2023 and 15% of the health insurance premium for the standard plan year
beginning September 1, 2024. The City shall pay the balance of the premium.
Employee contributions shall be made through payroll deduction as a condition
of coverage.
      (6)   The City will offer a more expensive plan, if available, as an
alternative to the standard plan; if the City does so, employees who select
that plan will pay an amount equal to their premium contribution for the
standard plan plus the difference in cost between the standard plan premium and
the more expensive plan premium.
      (7)   The City also may offer a less expensive plan as an alternative to
the standard plan; if the City does so, employees who select that plan will pay
an amount equal to their premium contribution for the standard plan minus the
difference in cost between the standard plan and the less expensive plan (but
not less than zero). (Ord. 69-2021. Passed 12-6-21.)
   (b)   Opt Out Program. Through August 31, 2016, non-bargaining unit
employees who are eligible for the health insurance benefit who opt not to take
that benefit shall pay paid annually an amount equal to 25% of the current
premium net of the 12% co-pay, with such benefit paid in equal installments per
pay period.
   Effective September 1, 2016, non-bargaining unit employees who are eligible
for the health insurance benefit who opt not to take that benefit shall be paid
annually $2,400.00 for waiving family coverage or $800.00 for waiving single
coverage. This amount will be paid in equal installments per pay period. In the
event there are 27 pay periods in a calendar year, one pay period will be
skipped.
   An employee who opts out of the health insurance benefit cannot be a
dependent on another City of Troy health insurance plan.
   This provision shall not commence each year until five (5) or more eligible
non-bargaining unit employees opt out of the health insurance benefit. This
annual benefit will run with the plan year.
   If there are factors that eliminate other coverage, the employee may opt
back in subject to the insurance plan eligibility and the opt-out amount will
be pro-rated.
   If in any plan year the number of non-bargaining unit employees that opt-out
drops below the number of five (5), there will be no Opt Out Program incentive
paid. If there are factors that eliminate other coverage, the employee may opt
back in subject to the insurance plan eligibility, and the opt-out amount will
be pro-rated.
   Participation will be subject to the employee providing the City with
required evidence of other coverage.
   (c)   Dental Plan Benefit. The City will maintain a dental plan benefit. The
City reserves all rights as to the determination of the insurance carrier. The
City will pay for 50% of the cost of each employee’s dental plan coverage,
including dependent coverage if applicable. The employee shall pay the
remaining 50% through payroll deduction as a condition of coverage. The City
will have no obligation to provide this benefit if the number of employees who
elect to participate falls below the carrier’s minimum participation
requirement, if any.
   (d)   Affordable Care Act Impact. The City reserves the right to modify the
health insurance provisions of this section to the minimum extent necessary to
avoid the imposition of any penalty, tax, or fine under the Affordable Care
Act, its implementing regulations, or any subsequent health insurance laws or
regulations enacted.

141.15 DUTY INJURY LEAVES.
   (a)   Eligibility. All employees of the City shall be entitled to injury
leave with pay for a period of up to ninety calendar days after the date of the
injury giving rise to such leave. To be eligible for such injury leave, the
injury shall have occurred while the employee was on duty and acting in the
line of duty for the City and shall result in a disability preventing
performance of duty. No injury leave shall be granted except upon application
by the eligible employee, or someone acting upon such employee’s behalf when
the injury prevents personal application, with such application to be
accompanied by the supporting statement of a licensed doctor setting forth the
nature of the injury. Once an employee has been cleared by a physician to
return to duty, an aggravation or re-injury which occurs while the employee is
on duty and acting non-negligently in the line of duty, shall constitute a
separate incident for the purpose of this section. Such described injury shall
warrant duty injury leave as described above.
   Should an employee who has been cleared by a physician to return to duty and
is returned, claim an aggravation or re-injury which occurs while the employee
is on duty and acting non- negligently in the line of duty, that shall
constitute a separate incident for the purpose of this section and shall be
submitted for consideration under the provisions of this section.
   (b)   Application/Process. Recognizing the issuance of temporary total
disability benefits by the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation for periods of time
covered by duty injury leave serves only to increase the expense to the City
without providing any additional benefit to the employee, the parties agree
that the City may elect to inform the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation that an
employee will receive full pay while on duty injury leave, so that temporary
total disability benefits will not be issued for that period of time.
   To receive duty injury leave, employees must provide their supervisor with
an application, which must include supporting documentation from a licensed
physician, and the City must approve the application. The supporting
documentation must describe the nature of the injujry, the extent of the
disability, and the estimated return to work date. Before approving an
application, the City may require a separate medical examination by a licensed
physician selected by the City and at the City’s expense.
   Employees must concurrently file a claim for Workers’ Compensation. The City
will notify the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation that it is paying an employee
Duty Injury Leave pay. An employee may not simultaneously receive Duty Injury
Leave pay and temporary total disability benefits from the Bureau of Workers’
Compensation. If the claim is finally rejected by the Bureau of Workers’
Compensation, Industrial Commission or court, any duty injury time shall revert
to sick leave or leave without pay. If the claim is ultimately allowed, and the
City previously denied Duty Injury Leave on the ground that the injury and
illness did not occur in the line of duty as a City employee, the City shall
grant Duty Injury Leave provided the illness or injury also resulted in an
inability to perform assigned duties.
   If the City grants Duty Injury Leave, the City shall inform the Bureau of
Workers’ Compensation that the employee will receive full pay while on Duty
Injury Leave, so that temporary total disability benefits will not be issued
for that period of time. If temporary total disability benefits are issued for
a period of time during which the employee receives Duty Injury Leave, the
employee shall sign over the BWC check to the City Auditor.
   An injured employee may, at the City’s option, perform limited duty within
the employee’s medical restrictions. If such duty is available, the employee
may be assigned such duty and Duty Injury Leave will be denied.
   (c)   Processing. The City has no control over the Bureau of Workers’
Compensation and cannot be responsible for the length of time it takes the
Bureau of Workers’ Compensation to process a claim and issue benefits.
   (d)   Extension. If the employee is not able to return to work at the end of
ninety days, such duty injury leave may be extended an additional thirty days,
by resolution of Council, subject, however, to the same terms and conditions of
eligibility as hereinabove set forth. Injured employees seeking an extension
under this provision are encouraged to make the request/provide medical
evidence no less than 20 days prior to the end of the ninety day period.
   (e)   Verification. For an absence to be considered due to a duty injury,
each absence must be verified by satisfactory medical evidence. This applies to
initial claims and reactivated prior claims.
   (f)   Notice to City. As a condition of duty injury pay, all forms
associated with duty injury (initial or reactivated) must be filed through the
City or a copy of such form must be filed with the City at the same time the
forms are filed with the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation. To assure prompt
consideration of a duty injury claim, at the time of termination due to death,
retirement under the applicable State Pension Law with an immediate pension, or
job abolishment, the employee shall promptly file all duty injury forms with
the City and, to the extent possible, the City will assist in the expediting of
claims.

created, received, or sent under the jurisdiction of the City and document the
organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other
activities of the City. The records maintained by the City and the ability to

   (b)   It is the policy of the City of Troy that records will be organized
and maintained so that they are readily available for inspection and copying.
(Ord. 62-2007. Passed 10-1-07.)
   143.04 RECORD REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least Identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the Public Records Custodian must
contact the requester for clarification, and should assist the requester In
revising the request by informing the requests of the manner in which the
office keeps its records.
   (b)   (1)   The Public Records Custodian may ask the requester to put a
verbal request in writing, may ask for the requester to give identifying
information, or may inquire about the intended use of the information; but a
written request is not mandatory, identifying information is not required and
the intended use does not have to be disclosed. However, providing such
information would benefit the requester by enhancing the ability of the Public
Records Custodian to identify, locate and deliver the public records requested.
      (2)   Public records can be accessed by one of the following methods:
         A.   A request to view public records in person;
         B.   A request for copies of public records that the requester will
personally pick up from the Public Records Custodian; or
         C.   A request for copies of public records that the requester wants
to have mailed or otherwise transmitted to the requester.
      (3)   Public records must be made available for inspection promptly.
Copies of public records must be made available within a reasonable period of
time. “Prompt” and “reasonable” take into account the volume of records
requested; the proximity of the location where the records are stored; and the
necessity for any legal review of the records requested.
         A.    Request to View Public Records. The requester may make a request
to view public records. The Public Records Custodian shall prepare the public
records for inspection “promptly,” as required by the Ohio Revised Code. The
actual time required to comply with the request may depend on the circumstances
(such as the location of the records, the manner kept or the volume of records
requested).
         B.    Copies of Public Records. The requester may make a request io
the Public Records Custodian to have copias of public records made.   
         C.    Transmitting Copies of Public Records. A requester may request
that copies of public records betransmilled by U.S. Mail or by any other means
of transmission that is available and is conducive to transmilling the public
records. The cost of transmission must be paid by the requester before the
public records will be provided. While the City is under no obligation to
provide records in electronic format, it is the policy of the City to provide
information to the public in the most practical and convenient manner,
considering all of the circumstances. Therefore, if the City receives a request
for information to be made available in an electronic format, such request will
be forwarded to the Public Records Custodian for a determination as to whether
such information will be generated and released in an electronic format.
   (c)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes, budgets, salary information, forms and
applications, and personnel rosters. If fewer than 20 pages of copies are
requested or if the records are readily available in an electronic format that
can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be made as quickly as the
equipment allows.
   (d)   All requests for public records must either be satisfied or be
acknowledged in writing by the public office within three business days
following the office's receipt of the request. If a request is deemed
significantly beyond "routine," such as seeking a voluminous number of copies
or requiring extensive research, the acknowledgment must include the following:
      (1)   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
      (2)   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
      (3)   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (e)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. ff there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority.
      (Ord. 62-2007. Passed 10-1-07.)
   143.05  FEES AND PAYMENT.
   (a)   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of
making copies or printing pictures and shall also pay the actual cost (e.g.
postage) of delivery and other supplies used in mailing, delivery or
transmission of the public record. Payment for public records requests may be
required prior to the actual copying or printing of records.
   (b)   Copies made on letter or legal size paper are five cents ($0.05) per
page, If the Public Records Custodian uses an outside copying service to make
the copies, the requester will be required to pay the cost of the entire
copying job, as billed by the copying service. Copies that are requested in
some format other than normal letter or legal paper will be "at cost," without
taking into account employee time spent preparing the copies. (For example,
public records in electronic format placed on a CD will be assessed the cost of
the CD, plus the cost, if any, of creating the electronic copies.)
   (c)   Public records will only be copied by the Public Records Custodian or
other authorized officers, employees or representatives. The Public Records
Custodian may use an outside copying service to make the copies, at the Public
Records Custodian's discretion. Under no circumstances will the requester be
permitted to make the copies himself or herself. The manner of copying is at
the discretion of the Public Records Custodian. Requests to copy a certain
number of public records on a given page, by “reducing” copy size or otherwise,
may be met at the discretion of the Public Records Custodian.
   (d)   Ohio law may provide for specific fees to be charged for certain
records (e.g. police accident reports four dollars ( $4.00) each, with
photographs at an addttional oost, pursuant to R.C. §5502.12).
(Ord. 62-2007. Passed 10-1-07.)
   143.06  DENIAL OF A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
    Under certain circumstances, some records may not be “public records” under
Ohio law or are exempt from disclosure under federal law. In these situations,
the public record request will be denied on that basis. A denial that is
responding to a written public reoortls request will also be given in writing.
Written reasons for denial will not be required for verbal public records
requests. Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority, unless federal or state law authorized or requires
the redaction.
   (a)   Redaction. When a public record contains information that is not
within the definition of a “public record” as defined by law, or is exempted by
law, the Public Records Custodian will make available that portion of the pubic
record that does meet the definition of a “public record”. The Public Reoortls
Custodian shall make a copy of the public record, perform the redaction, then
make a copy of that sheet and make the second copy available to the requester.
The requested will not be charged for the first copy made. If practical, the
first copy will be retained by the Public Records Custodian.
   (b)   Requests That Are Ambiguous, Overly Broad, or Are Difficult to
Identify the Public Records Requested. At times, a requester may make a public
records request from which the Public Records Custodian cannot determine which
public records are being sought. In such circumstances, the Public Records
Custodian will inform the requester that the public record request is denied,
but will give the requester an opportunity to more accurately describe the
public records sought. If the requester is seeking public records organized in
a certain way, but the public records are not organized in that way, the Public
Records Custodian will inform the requester of the manner that the public
records of the office under discussion are maintained and accessed. The
requester may then submit a public records request that more accurately
reflects the actual organization of the public records sought.
      (Ord. 62-2007. Passed 10-1-07.)
   143.07 COMPLIANCE.
   The Public Records Custodian reserves the right to consult with legal
counsel prior to the release of any public records to comply with laws
regarding the release of certain records.
(Ord. 62-2007. Passed 10-1-07.)
   143.08  FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   The City of Troy recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure
to properly respond to a public records request.
(Ord. 62-2007. Passed 10-1-07.)

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Domicile" means the true, fixed and permanent home of the
taxpayer to which whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return.
      (2)    An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for

the tax administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in

   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
section
171.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)    In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit
to the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) or (B)(1)(c) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
          (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month.       
         (c)   Unless otherwise required by resolution, ordinance, rule or
decision of the Tax Administrator, taxes required to be deducted and withheld
shall be remitted semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted on behalf of the Municipality
in the preceding calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-
nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required
to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the
preceding calendar year exceeded on thousand dollars. The payment under
division (B)(1)(c) of this section shall be made so that the payment is
received by the Tax Administrator not later than one of the following:
            (i)   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld during the first fifteen days of a month, the third
banking day after the fifteenth day of that month.
            (ii)   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first
day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last
day of that month.
         (d)    An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
171.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal

qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

at the location for more than twenty days.

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
 171.051 of this Chapter.

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)    Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)    If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
 171.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
 171.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such

amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)    The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the

persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)    A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)    For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
section
171.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section. (Ord. 40-15. Passed 11-16-15.)

include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:

      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

171.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division

      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

inquiry, review, court- martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
       (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be

real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.

taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
171.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.

computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least

included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than

all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass- through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
171.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of

an affiliated group.

taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first
month of the following taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for
the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the
fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety percent of the
tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
       (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
171.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section
171.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one- half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one- half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
171.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors. (Ord.
16-2018. Passed 3-19-18.)
171.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
171.081  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)    Where a resident of the Municipality Is subject to a municipal income
tax in another municipality, he shall not pay a total municipal income tax on
the other income greater than the tax imposed at the higher rate.
   (B)   (1)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Municipality who
receives salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service compensation
for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the Municipality, if
he has paid a municipal income tax on the same income taxable under this
Chapter to another municipality, shall be allowed a credit against the tax
imposed by this Chapter of the amount so paid by him or on his behalf to such
other municipality. The credit shall not exceed the tax assessed by this
Chapter on such income earned in such other municipality or municipalities
where such tax is paid.
      (2)    For individual taxpayers with income reported on Schedules C. E or
F who reside in the Municipality, the credit for taxes paid to other
municipalities shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    The taxpayer shall first determine the percentage of income
reported on federal Schedules C, E and F and, earned in and taxed by another
municipality compared to the total income reported on Schedules C, E and F
attributable to taxing and non-taxing jurisdictions. This percentage shall be
considered the "municipality contribution”
         (b)    The allowable credit shall equal the total Income reported on
Schedules C, E and F multiplied by the municipality contribution determined
under (a) multiplied by the lower of (i) the tax rate under this Chapter or
(ii) the rate at which such income was actually taxed.
         (c)    The taxpayer shall make the calculation for each other
municipality for which he is claiming a credit. (Ord. 61-2016. Passed 1-3-17.)
171.082  REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)    If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)    With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)    A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 40-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
171.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
171.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 61-2016. Passed 1-3-17.)
171.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
171.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
171.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
171.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
171.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
40-15. Passed 11-16-15.)

      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date

         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
171.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
171.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
 171.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
171.051 of this Chapter.

filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
171.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
 171.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.

section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to

Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this

tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.

      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a

amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the

facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section
 171.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
171.18 of this Chapter.

postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section

Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to

identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
171.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 40-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
171.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)    Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B) (1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. (Ord. 40-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
171.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and shall not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but shall not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)    The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)    No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B) Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax Administrator
shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the taxpayer's right
to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may appeal the
assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed, and to whom
the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 40-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
171.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
171.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section 171.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
 171.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to
which the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that
the amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less
than the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the
appellant's assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the
overpayment as provided by Section
171.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 40-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
171.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Ohio Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on

tenants of residential, commercial or industrial premises, shall file with the
Tax Administrator, a report showing the name(s) and address (and phone number,

their agent.
       (2)    If there is an oral lease or rental agreement, the person(s) who
entered into the oral lease or rental agreement with the owner or their agent.

this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than

171.30 FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF
CHAPTER.
   (A)   A taxpayer may elect to be subject to section
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances in lieu of the provisions set forth in
the remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of
the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in
171.03(47) of the Troy Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the
election;
      (2)   The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Ohio Revised Code, sections

termination of the election.
         (b)   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, and is instead subject to the
provisions set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (C)   The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer sections
171.30 to

      (1)   Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)   Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the
duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (D)   The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Ohio Revised Code and Section
171.03 of the Troy Codified Ordinances. (Ord. 15-2018. Passed 3-5-18.)
171.31 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States
relating to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and
the use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United
States relating to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the
term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code, unless the term is defined in
Chapter 5703 of the Ohio Revised Code, in which case the definition in that
chapter shall control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue
Code includes other laws of the United States related to federal income taxes.
If a term is defined in both this section and section
171.03 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall
control for all uses of that term in sections
171.03 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances.
   As used in sections
171.03 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)   "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
City of Troy under section
171.32 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017
net operating loss carryforward available to the person for the City of Troy.
   (B)   "Adjusted federal taxable income" for a person required to file as a C
corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation as
described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Ohio Revised Code and
section
171.03 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
       (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five percent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division E(3)(b) of
section
171.36 of the Troy Codified Ordinances.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division E(3)(b) of section
171.36 of the Troy Codified Ordinances.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in division
171.01 of section
171.03 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded
partnership that has made the election described in division
171.01 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted
federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
171.03(47) of the Troy Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not
include natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or
trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a
taxpayer.
   (D)   "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal
income taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist
of an aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax
purposes. The tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as
the taxable year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for
federal income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable
years for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership,
or for a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)   "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
171.40 of the Troy Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 15-2018. Passed 3-5-18.)
   
171.32 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City of Troy and that has made the election under section
171.40 of the Troy Codified Ordinances.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of the section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City of Troy shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the City of Troy for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City of Troy during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.

   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City of Troy, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may
require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the
income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or
more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the City
of Troy;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
171.40 of the Troy Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City of
Troy as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the City of Troy
from a stock of goods located within the City of Troy.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the City of Troy from a
location outside the City of Troy, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
City of Troy and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City of Troy to the extent that such services are performed in the City of
Troy.

property shall be sitused to the City of Troy based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in the City of Troy.
   (E)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City of Troy in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the City of Troy based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the City of Troy to the commissions received from the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under
171.03(II)(L) of the Troy Codified Ordinances by the City of Troy or
substantially similar provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal
corporation, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to
the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City of Troy. In no case
shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to
the City of Troy any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would
be required to pay tax where the amount related to the stock option not
exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City of Troy
under this section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity. (Ord. 15-2018. Passed 3-5-18.)

the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)   An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this

commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)   If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with sections
171.011 to 171.014 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, the commissioner may

   (B)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of

have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to the
City of Troy. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax return for

deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in

the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
171.32 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and
gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to the City of Troy. If the entity's net profit or

gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to the City of Troy. If the entity's net profit or
loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate
taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in section
171.32 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and
gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to the City of Troy;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections

the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
171.32 of the Troy Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit
from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.

severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Ohio Revised Code
to the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member
for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an
affiliated group.

before the date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed,
collected, and paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code from

year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as

having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the

or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes

declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

and remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the
amounts prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be

as described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment

presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
the City of Troy in accordance with section 718.83 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year. (Ord. 15-2018. Passed 3-5-18.)
171.39 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Ohio Revised
Code, the following penalties shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
171.30  to
171.45  of the Troy Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return
within the time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may
impose a penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)   For each of the first two failures, five percent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten percent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
171.30 of the Troy Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax
required to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty
equal to fifteen percent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon
which the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains
information that on its face indicates that the return is substantially
incorrect, and the filing of the return in that manner is due to a position
that is frivolous or a desire that is apparent from the return to delay or
impede the administration of sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars
may be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding
the greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred percent of the tax required
to be shown on the return.
       (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund
under section
171.41 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding
the greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred percent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
171.40 of the Troy Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation
for the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
the City of Troy in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability is
required to be distributed to the City of Troy under section 718.83 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
(Ord. 15-2018. Passed 3-5-18.)
171.40 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
171.41 of the Troy Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall
be no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a
return subject to assessment as required by sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Ohio Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (C)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Ohio Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until
the assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Ohio Revised Code, whichever comes
first. If the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney
general for collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Ohio
Revised Code from the date of certification until the date it is paid in its
entirety. Interest shall be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be
collected by issuing an assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the City
of Troy income tax fund and distributed to the City of Troy corporation to
which the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)   If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Ohio Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the
clerk. The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the
taxpayer assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division
(B) of this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the
commissioner and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the
assessment. Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the
commissioner's consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
171.41 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as
provided by that section.
(Ord. 15-2018. Passed 3-5-18.)
171.41 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed
with the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
171.40 of the Troy Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the
form prescribed by the tax commissioner.
 
   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the application is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Ohio Revised Code. If the amount is greater
than ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify the City of Troy of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to the City of Troy corporation, which shall be deducted from the
City of Troy's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (C)   Any person of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Ohio
Revised Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day
the refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.  
(Ord. 15-2018. Passed 3-5-18.)
171.42 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
section
171.30 of the Troy Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
171.40 of the Troy Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any
additional tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and
interest. The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject
to assessment that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
171.41 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms
to the requirements of that section. An application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in section
171.41 of the Troy Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 15-2018. Passed 3-5-18.)
171.43 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)   The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the
accuracy of any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax
due as required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner
or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
171.30 to
171.45 of the Troy Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability for the income tax
levied by the City of Troy.
   (C)   The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.
(Ord. 15-2018. Passed 3-5-18.)

credit is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the

      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the City of Troy and taxpayer under section
171.064 to
171.065 of the Troy Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or conditions

Troy from prosecuting any and all other offenses that may apply. (Ord. 15-2018.
Passed 3-5-18.)

   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the

   303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property. If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated

towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the

municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,

violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the

operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that

control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn

from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,
or a combination of them.
            2.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or

      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a

court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court    may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,

that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,

affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a

under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it

proceed with due caution and, if possible with due regard to the road, weather,
and traffic conditions, shall change lanes into a lane that is not adjacent to

Commission to conduct motor vehicle inspections in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4923.04 and 4923.06 or a highway maintenance vehicle.

would be unsafe, the driver shall proceed with due caution, reduce the speed of
the motor vehicle, and maintain a safe speed for the road, weather and traffic

subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section when so required by subsection (a) of
this section.
   (d)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of
the offense, the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to
one predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section
is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate

offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense. (ORC 4511.213)

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be

license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)

   501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
 
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.

   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section. If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution. Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution. If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of                      Maximum

First degree                 $ 5000.00

Misdemeanor not specifically 2000.00
classified
Minor misdemeanor not        1000.00
specifically classified
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this

repairing or maintaining an existing fence that is not in compliance with
subsection (f) or (g) listed above, with a fence at the same location on the
lot and maintaining the same height and material previously used.
   (l)   There shall be no more than one (1) fence between adjacent property
owners on or adjacent to the adjoining property lines. A second fence shall be

      (4)   On any side where a legally preexisting fence was constructed off
of the property line prior to the enactment of subsection (l)(4), provided that
there is a minimum of five (5) feet between adjacent fences. The applicant
shall make every effort to avoid a second fence where feasible.
A dog run or kennel enclosure is defined as an enclosed area within the rear
yard that does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the rear yard.
   (m)   No fence shall be erected unless it contains at least one (1) access
gate.

with a self-closing and self-latching device for keeping the gate or door
securely closed at all times when not in actual use, and all gates or doors
opening through such enclosure shall be designed to permit locking and shall be
kept located when the pool is not in actual use or is left unattended. This
requirement shall be applicable to all new swimming pools or family pools
hereafter constructed, other than indoor pools, and shall apply to all existing
pools which have a minimum depth of twenty-four inches of water. No existing
pool enclosure shall be removed, replaced, or changed in a manner that reduces
its effectiveness as a safety barrier. Above- ground swimming pools with
ladders/steps that can be removed or locked to prohibit access shall be exempt
from the provisions of subsection (p). Spas or hot tubs with a safety cover
that complies with ASTM F 1346 shall be exempt from the provisions of

fence receives a fence permit from the Planning Division. Applications for such
a permit shall include a drawing showing the shape and dimension of the
property upon which the fence is being erected; height, location, type of
material of the proposed fence; the location of all buildings on the lot; and
any other information deemed necessary by the Planning Division. The Director
of Public Service and Safety shall establish a fee for the permit and the
format of the application form, which shall require each applicant to certify
that the fence does not encroach upon another owner’s lot or parcel of land.
The City shall furnish inspection as it deems necessary to determine that the
fence is constructed in accordance with plans submitted for the permit and the
requirements of this section. Any inspection provided shall not be construed to
mean that the City has determined that the fence is on the appropriate lot, nor
relieve any property owner of their duty imposed by law.
   (r)   All fences, except fences located within the Agricultural,
Agricultural- Residential, or R-1 zoning districts, shall be placed upon the
lot lines, or as near as practicable, unless the rear lot line abuts a public
right-of-way, with the exception that fences may be allowed to intrude into the
required rear and side yards to provide for enclosure for the fenced in area.
Fences located in the front yard setback are not required to be on the property
line.

variance from the terms of this section only in those specific instances
enumerated herein and then only when the BZA has made findings of fact, based

provisions of this section will result in practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardship for the owner, lessee, or occupant of land or structures.

otherwise agreed by the applicant. Public notice of such hearing shall be
published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City not
less than five (5) nor more than twenty (20) days before such hearing. Such
notice shall contain the date, time, and place of the hearing, a brief
description of the relief sought. Written notice shall be given at least five

         B.   To vary the applicable height regulations.
      (5)   Standards.
         A.   The BZA shall not grant a variance as authorized in Section
521.07(s)(4) unless it shall, in each case, make specific findings of fact
directly based upon the particular evidence presented to it, which support
conclusions that:
            1.   The variance requested arises from a condition which is
unique, that is, a condition which is not ordinarily found in the same zoning
district and the condition is created by the regulations of this section and
not by an action or actions of the property owner or the applicant.
            2.   The granting of the variance will not adversely affect the
rights of adjacent property owners or residents.
            3.   The strict application of the provisions of this section from
which a variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the
property owner represented in the application.
            4.   The variance desired will not adversely affect the public
health, safety, morals, convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general welfare.
            5.   The variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit
and intent of this section.
         B.   In determining whether the evidence supports the conclusions
required by this section as set out above, the BZA shall consider and
specifically detail in the findings of fact the extent to which the evidence
demonstrates that:
            1.   The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
condition of the specific property involved would result in a practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship upon or for the owner, lessee, or occupant,
as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the provisions of this section
were literally enforced.
            2.   The request for a variance is not based exclusively upon a
desire of the owner, lessee, or occupant, or applicant to realize economic
gain.
            3.   The granting of the variance will not be materially
detrimental or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood
in which the subject property is located.
            4.   The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of
light or air to adjacent property, substantially increase the congestion in the
public streets, increase the danger of fire, endanger the public safety, or
substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.
      (6)   Conditions and Restrictions. In granting a variance, the BZA may
impose such conditions, safeguards and restrictions upon the premises benefited
by the variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards set out in
Section
521.07(s)(5) so as to reduce or minimize any potential injurious effect of such
variance upon other property in the neighborhood, and to carry out the general
purpose and intent of this section.
      (7)   Decisions and Records. The BZA shall render a written decision on
an application for a variance without unreasonable delay after the close of a
hearing, but in all cases, within thirty (30) days from the close of the
hearing. The Secretary of the BZA shall maintain complete records of all
actions of the BZA with respect to applications for variances from the section.
      (8)   Period of Validity. No variance granted by the BZA shall be valid
for a period longer than six (6) months from the date on which the BZA grants
the variance, unless within such six (6) month period a Fence Permit is
obtained and construction is started. The Planning Division, upon written
application, may grant an extension not exceeding six (6) months.
   (t)   Fences constructed for security purposes at governmental installations
and if allowed or mandated by state or federal law may exceed height, setback
and mate`rial requirements, such as barbed wire and razor wire or other similar
materials, with written consent from the City Engineer.
   (u)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, punishable as provided in Section
 501.99 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Troy, Ohio and each day such
a violation is continued shall constitute a separate offense. If the offender
has previously been convicted of a violation of this section, then a subsequent

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of

involved in the offense.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
   545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

   703.01 DEFINITIONS.
   When used in this chapter and unless otherwise distinctly expressed, the
following words and phrases shall have the meanings set out herein:
   (a)    "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (b)    "Director of Collections" means the Director of Collections of the
City of Troy, Ohio.
   (c)    "Hotel" or "motel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained,
advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more
rooms are used for the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms are in
one or several structures.
   (d)    "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (e)    "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in
money, whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash,
credits and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for
which the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (f)    "Operator" means the person who is the proprietor of the hotel or
motel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, licensee, mortgagee in
possession, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions
through a managing agent of any type or character, other than an employee, the
managing agent shall be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and
shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with
the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent
shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.
   (g)    "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms, or space or portion thereof, in any hotel or
motel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or
right to use or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office
space, banquet or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space
shall not be considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless
the person exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or
possess all or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging
or sleeping purposes.
      (Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.02 RATE OF TAX.
   (a)    For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the City for the use of the general fund of the City, there is hereby levied a
tax of three percent (3%) on all rents received by a hotel or motel for lodging
furnished to transient guests.
   (b)    Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City,
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City.
   (c)    The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel or
motel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guest ceasing to occupy space in the hotel
or motel. If, for any reason, the tax due is not paid to the operator of the
hotel or motel, the Director of Collections may require that such tax shall be
paid directly to the Director of Collections.
(Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.03 EXEMPTIONS.
   No tax shall be imposed under this chapter:
   (a)    Upon rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
Constitution or laws of Ohio or the United States; or
   (b)    Upon rents paid by the State of Ohio or any of its political
subdivisions.
   No exemption claimed under subsections (a) and (b) hereof shall be granted
except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under
penalty or perjury upon a form prescribed by the Director of Collections. All
claims of exemption shall be made in the manner prescribed by the Director of
Collections.
(Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.04 TAX-EXEMPT STATUS FALSIFIED.
   (a)    No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as
required by this chapter, or present to the operator false evidence indicating
that the lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax.
   (b)    If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest shall
furnish to the operator, and the operator shall obtain from the transient
guest, a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject
to the tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed the tax
applies.
(Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.05 TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)    The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy or any bill or statement or charge made for such occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)    No operator of a hotel or motel shall advertise or state in any
manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will
be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the
rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner
hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.06 REGISTRATION.
   (a)    Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter, or
within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator
of any hotel or motel renting lodging to transient guests shall register such
hotel or motel with the Director of Collections and obtain from him a
"Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate" to be at all times posted in a
conspicuous place on the premises. Such certificate shall, among other things,
state the following:
      (1)    The name of the operator;
      (2)    The address of the hotel or motel;
      (3)    The date upon which the certificate was issued;
      (4)    "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that
the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the
Hotel-Motel Tax Ordinance by registering with the Director of Collections of
the City of Troy for the purpose of collecting from transient guests the Hotel-
Motel Tax and remitting such tax to the Director of Collections. This
certificate does not constitute a permit."
         (Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.07 RECORDS; INSPECTION; DESTRUCTION.
   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices, and such other pertinent
documents. If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
operator's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was not exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction,
if exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be
opened during business hours to the inspection of the Director of Collections,
and shall be preserved for a period of four years, unless the Director, in
writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or by any orders
requesting that such records be kept for a longer period of time.
(Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.08 REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   Each operator shall, on or before the tenth day of the month, for the
preceding month's business, or at the close of any longer reporting period
which may be established by the Director of Collections, make a return to the
Director on forms provided by him of the total rents charged and received and
the amount of tax collected by transient occupancies. All claims for exemption
from tax filed by occupants with the operator during the reporting period shall
be filed with the report. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of
the tax collected shall be remitted to the Director. The Director may establish
shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary
in order to insure collection of the tax, and he may require further
information in the return, if such information is pertinent to the collection
of the tax. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business
for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall
be held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to
the Director. All returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be
treated as confidential by the Director and shall not be released by him except
upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of
the United States, the State of Ohio, the County of Miami, or the City for
official use only.
(Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.09 PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)    Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten
percent (10%) of the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)    Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittances on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which
the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty
equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount of the tax and previous penalty in
addition to the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed. An
additional penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the total tax and penalty of
the previous thirty-day period shall be added for each successive thirty-day
period that the account remains delinquent.
   (c)    Fraud. If the Director of Collections determines that the nonpayment
of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to
twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in
addition to the penalties stated in subsections (a) and (b) hereof.
   (d)    Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one-half of one percent (1%) per month, or fraction thereof, on the
amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent until paid.
   (e)    Penalties During Pendency of Hearing or Appeal. No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed ruling the pendency of any
hearing provided for herein, nor during the pendency of any appeal to the Board
of Tax Appeals provided for herein.
(Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.10 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF TAX BY DIRECTOR.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such tax and to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Director of Collections shall
proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on
which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Director shall
procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base
the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator
who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and
remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the
tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such
determination is made, the Director shall give a notice of the amount so
assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known
place of business. Such operator may, within ten days after the serving or
mailing of such notice, make application in writing to the Director for a
hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is
not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any,
determined by the Director shall become final and conclusive and immediately
due and payable. If such application is made, the Director shall give not less
than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator
to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount
specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At
such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified
tax, interest and penalties should not be fixed. After such hearing, the
Director shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter
give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such
determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount
determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is
taken as provided in Section
703.11.
(Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.11 APPEAL.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Director of Collections with
respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal
to the Board of Tax Appeals by filing a notice of appeal with it within fifteen
days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Board shall
fix a time and place for hearing such appeal and shall give notice in writing
to such operator at his last known place of business. The findings of the Board
shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the
manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to
be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.12 ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   Any tax required to be paid by a transient guest under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient guest to the City.
Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the City shall
be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the City. Any person owing money to
the City under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action
brought in the name of the City for the recovery of such amount.
(Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.13 VIOLATIONS; MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)    Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
fined of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or be imprisoned for a
period of not more than six months, or both.
   (b)    Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as
required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or
refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the Director
of Collections, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim, is guilty
of a misdemeanor, and is punishable as aforesaid. Any person required to make,
render, sign or verify any report or claim who makes a false or fraudulent
report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount
due required by this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is
punishable as aforesaid.
(Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.14 REFUNDS.
   (a)    Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid
or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or
received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) hereof, provided a claim in writing therefor, stating
under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded,
is filed with the Director of Collections within three years of the date of
payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Director.
   (b)    An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Director that the person from whom the tax has been collected
was not a transient guest; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a
credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently payable
by the transient to the operator.
   (c)    A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by
filing of a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only
when the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Director, or when
the transient guest having paid to the operator, establishes to the
satisfaction of the Director that the transient guest has been unable to obtain
a refund from the operator who collected the tax.
   (d)    No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless
the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.
(Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.15 SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, subdivision, paragraph, sentence, clause or
phrase of this chapter or any part thereof is for any reason held
unconstitutional, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining
portions of this chapter or any part thereof.
(Ord. 27-88. Passed 6-6-88.)
   703.16 MONEYS RECEIVED; WHERE CREDITED.

or which offers to furnish and provide such system under and pursuant to the

   711.04 USES PERMITTED BY GRANTEE.

CATV system in the City; and the acceptance of any franchise hereunder shall
operate, as between grantee and the City, as an abandonment of any and all of
such rights, privileges, powers, immunities and authorities within the City, to
the effect that, as between grantee and the City, any and all construction,
operation and maintenance by any grantee of any CATV system in the City shall
be, and shall be deemed and construed in all instances and respects to be,
under and pursuant to such franchise, and not under or pursuant to any other

provisions contained herein shall be construed to prevent the City from
granting any identical or similar franchise to any other person, firm or

constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power

provided insofar as the grantee has power to accomplish this.
   (d)    Failure on the part of the grantee to commence and diligently pursue
each of the foregoing requirements and to complete each of the matters set

filed with the Auditor and shall contain the following information:
      (1)    The name and address of the applicant. If the applicant is a
partnership, the name and address of each partner shall also be set forth. If
the applicant is a corporation, the application shall also state the names and
addresses of its directors, main offices, major stockholders and associates,
and the names and addresses of parent and subsidiary companies.
      (2)    A statement that the applicant gives full assurance that the
proposed CATV system and its various components will be constructed, maintained
and/or operated in a manner acceptable to the provision of the Federal
Communications Commission's Technical Standards.
      (3)    A general description of the public streets, public places and
proposed public streets within which the applicant proposes or seeks authority
to construct, install or maintain any CATV equipment or facilities and a
detailed description of the equipment or facilities proposed to be constructed,
installed or maintained therein.
      (4)    A map specifically showing and delineating the proposed service
area or areas within which the applicant proposes to provide CATV services and
for which a franchise is requested.
      (5)    A statement or schedule in a form approved by the Director of
proposed rates and charges to subscribers for installation and services, and a
copy of proposed service agreement between the grantee and its subscribers
shall accompany the application. For unusual circumstances, such as underground
cable required, or more than 150 feet of distance from cable to connection of
service to subscribers, an additional installation charge over that normally
charged for installation as specified in the applicant's proposal may be
charged, with easements to be supplied by subscribers. For remote, relatively
inaccessible subscribers within the City, service may be made available on the
basis of cost of materials, labor and easements if required by the grantee,
unless unusual circumstances exist.
      (6)    A copy of any contract, if existing, between the applicant and any
public utility providing for the use of facilities of such public utility, such
as poles, lines or conduits.
      (7)    A statement setting forth all agreements and understandings,
whether written, oral or implied, existing between the applicant and any
person, firm or corporation with respect to the proposed franchise or the
proposed CATV operation. If a franchise is granted to a person, firm or
corporation posing as a front or as the representative of another person, firm
or corporation, and such information is not disclosed in the original
application, such franchise shall be deemed void and of no force and effect
whatsoever.
      (8)    A financial statement prepared by a certified public accountant or
person otherwise satisfactory to Council, showing the applicant's financial
status and his financial ability to complete the construction and installation
of the proposed CATV system.
      (9)    Council may at any time demand, and the applicant shall provide,
such supplementary, additional or other information as Council may deem
reasonably necessary to determine whether the requested franchise should be
granted.
   (b)    Upon consideration of any such application, Council may refuse to
grant the requested franchise or Council may, by ordinance, grant a franchise
for a CATV system to any such applicant as may appear from such application to
be in its opinion best qualified to render proper and efficient CATV service to
television viewers and subscribers in the City. Council's decision in the
matter shall be final.
   The grantee, by its acceptance of the franchise, specifically grants and
agrees that its application to provide cable television services to the City,
is thereby incorporated by reference and made a part of the franchise. Grantee
thereby agrees to provide all services set forth in its application. In the
event of a conflict between such application and the provisions of this
chapter, that provision which provides the greatest benefit to the City, in the
opinion of Council, shall prevail.
   Failure to provide the services promised in grantee's application as
incorporated herein shall be deemed a material violation of this chapter for
which the provisions of Section
711.05 shall apply.
   (c)    Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall include the
following condition:
   "The CATV system herein franchised shall be used and operated solely and
exclusively for the purpose expressly authorized by ordinance of the City and

   Inclusion of the foregoing statement in any such franchise shall not be
deemed to limit the authority of the City to include any other reasonable
condition, limitation or restriction which it may deem necessary to impose in
connection with such franchise pursuant to the authority conferred by this
chapter.

and parochial school building, including any college or university which may

   (a)   Not sooner than forty-five nor later than sixty days after the end of

subscribers that potentially receive the advertising under the contract or
arrangement.

         E.   Charges for services other than video service, reasonably
identifiable on books or records the video service provider keeps in the

bundled with amounts billed to video service subscribers, including, but not
limited to any revenue received by a video service provider or its affiliates

directory or internet advertising, including yellow pages, white pages, banner
advertising, and electronic publishing;

provider under a franchise in effect in the City, the percentage of gross
revenue payable in that calendar quarter by the video service provider to the
City shall be the same percentage of gross revenue payable in that calendar
quarter pursuant to that franchise, not to exceed five percent.    
      (2)   Otherwise, the percentage shall be five (5) percent of a video
service provider’s gross revenues, as calculated in accordance with this
chapter.
   (d)   A video service provider that pays a video service provider fee
pursuant to this section may identify and collect the amount of that fee as a
separate line item on the regular bill of each of its video service subscribers
that has a service address within any portion of the City.

the amount of video service provider fee due based on the audit results may be

(Ord. 3-06. Passed 2-6-06.)
   747.10 HEARING; LICENSE DENIAL, SUSPENSION, REVOCATION; PROMPT JUDICIAL
REVIEW, APPEAL.
   (a)   If the Enforcement Officer determines that facts exists for denial,
suspension, or revocation of a license under this chapter, the Enforcement
Officer shall notify the applicant or licensee (respondent) in writing of the
intent to deny, suspend, or revoke the license, including the grounds therefor,
by personal delivery, or by certified mail. The notification shall be directed
to the most current business address on file with the Enforcement Officer.
Within five working days of receipt of such notice, the respondent may provide
to the Director of Public Service and Safety, in writing, a response that shall
include a statement of reasons why the license or permit should not be denied,
suspended, or revoked. Within three days of the receipt of respondent’s written
response, the Director of Public Service and Safety shall notify respondent in
writing of the hearing date on respondent’s denial, suspension, or revocation
proceeding.
      (1)   Within ten working days of the receipt of respondents written
response, the Director of Public Service and Safety shall conduct a hearing at
which respondent shall have the opportunity to be represented by counsel and
present evidence and witnesses on his or her behalf. If a response is not
received by the Director of Public Service and Safety in the time stated or, if
after the hearing, the Director of Public Service and Safety finds that grounds
as specified in this chapter exist for denial, suspension, or revocation, then
such denial, suspension, or revocation shall become final five days after the
Director of Public Service and Safety sends, by certified mail, written notice
that the license has been denied, suspended, or revoked. Such notice shall
include a statement advising the applicant or licensee of the right to appeal
such decision to a court of competent jurisdiction.
      (2)   If the Director of Public Service and Safety finds that no grounds

after the hearing, the Director of Public Service and Safety shall withdraw the
intent to deny, suspend, or revoke the license, and shall so notify the
respondent in writing by certified mail of such action and shall
contemporaneously issue the license.
   (b)   Prompt Judicial Review. The City is aware of the Constitutional
requirement to provide prompt judicial review to persons affected by this
Chapter. Since the City cannot legally mandate the timing of judicial review in
these matters, the City has created a right to a temporary permit or the
continuation of a permit to maintain the status quo for these persons while
they seek quasi-judicial and judicial review to prevent the suppression of
speech or expression protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution.
   (c)   (1)   If the Director of Public Service and Safety issues a denial,
suspension, or revocation of a permit or application for a permit under this
Chapter, the Director of Public Service and Safety shall notify the applicant
or permittee (respondent) in writing of the denial, suspension or revocation of
the permit or application, including the grounds therefore, within three
business days of such decision. The notification shall be directed as provided
in subsection (a) hereof. The notification shall include information regarding

permit or application should not be denied, suspended or revoked. A response
shall be deemed to have been received when delivered to the Troy City Hall at
100 South Market Street, Troy, Ohio during regular business hours. If no
response is received by the Board of Zoning Appeals within said ten (10) days,
the action shall become final. If a written notice is received by the Board of
Zoning Appeals within said ten (10) days, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
notify the respondent by overnight mail at the address provided or by telefax
to the phone number provided of the hearing date within three (3) business days
of the receipt of such written response.
         B.   Within ten (10) days of the receipt of such written response, the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall conduct a hearing at which respondent shall have

respondent may appear and be heard in person, or by his/her attorney, in
opposition to the decision and do any of the following: (a) present his/her
positions, arguments and contentions; (b) offer and examine witnesses and
present evidence in support; (c) cross-examine witnesses purporting to refute
evidence and testimony offered in opposition to his/her position, arguments and
contentions; and (e) proffer any such evidence into record, if the admission is
denied by the Board of Zoning Appeals. Testimony shall be given under oath. The
Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power available to the respondent. The
Board of Zoning Appeals shall have a complete record of the adjudicated kept,
including any evidence admitted or proffered. If after the hearing the Board of
Zoning Appeals finds, by simple majority vote, that grounds as specified in
this Chapter exist for denial, suspension or revocation, then such action shall
become final and notice of such final action shall be sent to the applicant or
permittee, by written decision. If the Board of Zoning Appeals finds, by a
simple majority vote of the members present at the hearing, that no grounds
exist for denial, suspension or revocation of a permit then the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall overturn the denial, suspension or revocation of the permit or
application. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall notify the respondent in writing
by delivery, overnight mail, telefax or by certified mail of such action.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall send their decision within five business
days after the hearing. The notice of the final decision shall contain: (1) The
case number or other identifier, the applicant and a brief description of the
matter before the Board of Zoning Appeals; (2) A designation as a final
decision; (3) A clear pronouncement of the Board of Zoning Appeals’ decision
including conclusions of the fact supporting the final order; (4) The
signatures of the members of the Board of Zoning Appeals; and (5) The date the
decision was mailed, faxed, or delivered.
         C.   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall conduct any hearing pursuant to
this section relating to an application for a sexually oriented business permit
or sexually oriented business employee or independent contractor permit, and
approve or deny the appeal within thirty days after notice is received by the
Board of Zoning Appeals from the respondent of an appeal. The respondent may,
however, request a rescheduling or continuance of the hearing date set by the
Board of Zoning Appeals, in which case the hearing date shall be extended for a
reasonable period, and the thirty day time period for the Board of Zoning
Appeals to decide the appeal shall be extended by the number of days the
hearing is postponed due to the respondent’s request.
      (2)   A suspension or revocation shall not be final and in effect if an
appeal is filed until the later of the Board of Zoning Appeals’ decision on the
appeal becoming final and expiration of any time period for initial appeal to
court from a denial of the appeal by the Board of Zoning Appeals, or if an
appeal is taken to court, the entering of a judgment on the appeal by a court
of competent jurisdiction. The existing permit shall remain in effect during
such period.
      (3)   If the Board of Zoning Appeals has received a written appeal
objecting to a denial of a permit/application, then the Director of Public
Service and Safety shall immediately grant or continue a temporary permit to
operate or work at the sexually oriented business. The temporary permit shall
continue in effect until the later of Board of Zoning Appeals’ decision on the
final appeal being final and expiration of any time period for initial appeal
to court from denial by the Board of Zoning Appeals of the appeal, or if an
appeal is taken to court, the entering of a judgment on the appeal by a court
of competent jurisdiction. Operations under such temporary permit shall be
subject to all provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   When a decision to deny, suspend or revoke a permit has been
appealed and that decision becomes final, the applicant or permittee whose
application for a permit has been denied or whose permit has been suspended or
revoked shall have the right to appeal such action to a court of competent
jurisdiction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2506.

   749.01  PURPOSE.
   Signs and the sign industry represent an important part of the public
communication and identification system within the Troy community. Also,
advertising by means of signs is recognized as a legitimate part of business
enterprise. Of equal importance is accomplishing this communication,
identification, and advertising in a manner that will not detract from existing
business and residential investment and in a manner consistent with local
values of community appearance and traffic and pedestrian safety. The City of
Troy has historically evidenced a concern in keeping the City beautiful.
Uncontrolled use of signs can lead to visual clutter, thus reducing the
effectiveness of the individual messages and, in some cases, rendering
individual signs useless. Thus, there is a public benefit, a public value, and
an element of the public safety in controlling the location, type, and size of
signs within the City. The sign regulations of this Sign Code are intended to
take into consideration the community appearance as well as safety effects of
signs upon the environment in which they are located. This regulation also
intends to protect and safeguard the First Amendment of the United States
Constitution.
   (a)   Findings.
      (1)   City Council members recognize that signs not only serve commercial
purposes but that they offer an easy method for providing site-specific
information and an inexpensive way for people to express their opinions on
matters of public interest and their support for particular causes or events.
For that reason, City Council members find that it is both necessary and
appropriate to provide more liberally for noncommercial signs than for
commercial ones, but that noncommercial signs, like commercial ones, should be
subject to significant limitations in size and height.
      (2)   The current Troy Zoning Ordinance was approved on January 1, 2000,
after considerable public discussion, which included a sign code.
      (3)   Throughout the time that the City has administered and maintained a
sign ordinance, signs espousing political candidates and causes and expressing
individual opinions on matters of public policy have appeared throughout the
community with no record of municipal interference with such signs based on
their content and with no litigation over the use of signs to express personal
opinions.
      (4)   Sign regulation in Troy is part of a comprehensive program of
planning and zoning controls.
      (5)   Safety of traffic and pedestrians is also an important
consideration to the City Council of Troy in amending its sign ordinance.
      (6)   Based on evidence and based on their personal observations as
drivers and passengers, the City Council finds that there is evidence that
billboards and other signs distract drivers for at least brief periods of time
from their driving tasks and that such distraction may have an effect on
traffic safety.
      (7)   Although the evidence regarding traffic safety is mixed, City
Council members are well aware that the intent of billboard advertisers is to
attract the attention of drivers, thus distracting them from their driving task
and creating an increased risk of accidents.
      (8)   The City Council finds that there is a relationship between traffic
safety and the regulation of signs and a particular relationship between
traffic safety and large signs such as billboards.
      (9)   Main Street in Troy is also Ohio State Route 41, which carries in
excess of ten thousand vehicles through the heart of the City.
      (10)   Market Street in Troy is also Ohio State Route 55, which carries
in excess of ten thousand vehicles through the heart of the City.
      (11)   Because much of the traffic on S.R. 41 and S.R. 55 exits from I-75
in Troy, vehicles are often used to traveling at relatively high rates of
speed, creating a potentially dangerous situation for pedestrians in the
downtown area.
      (12)   A major north-south arterial in Troy is County Road 25A, which
also functions as a secondary road for I-75, carrying tens of thousands of
vehicles per day on Main Street and Market Street.
      (13)   Although there is less pedestrian activity along County Road 25A
than along main thoroughfares, there are many intersections with local and
collector streets, creating a more complex driving environment than is found on
frontage roads.
      (14)   Troy has other exits from I-75 which draw traffic from and feeds
traffic to County Road 25A.
      (15)   Commercial and light industrial activity focused around I-75,
County Road 25A, major thoroughfares and the two Interstate 75 exits create a
significant demand for commercial advertising, a demand that the City must
balance with its goal of maintaining local traffic conditions that are safe for
drivers and pedestrians alike.
      (16)   For all of these reasons, the City Council finds that it is both
necessary and appropriate as part of its overall zoning and sign provisions and
other code provisions designed to preserve and protect the public health,
safety and welfare in the physical development of the community to adopt a Sign
Code.
      (17)   City Council and the Planning Commission held public meetings to
review the draft to the Sign Code.
         (Ord. 7-2009. Passed 2-2-09.)

   749.07 COMPUTATION OF SIGN AREA AND SIGN HEIGHT.
   (a)   Computation of Area of Individual Signs. The area of a sign shall be
computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or
geometric combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the
writing, representation, emblem, and/or other display, together with any
material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or
used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it
is placed.
      (1)   Panels. The area of the surface, or surfaces, of an opaque or
translucent panel used or intended for displaying a message.
      (2)   Irregular Shapes. For a sign comprised of irregularly shaped
elements, the area of such sign shall be computed as a combination of not more
than four (4) rectangles which form or approximate the perimeter of all the
elements in the display.
      (3)   Combining Individual Elements. For a sign comprised of individual
letters, figures, or elements on a wall or similar surface, the area of such
sign shall be calculated by determining the geometric form or combination of
forms which comprise all the display area, including the space between the
elements.
      (4)   Window or Door Panels. The area of the surface of any opaque panel
used or intended for displaying a permanent message that is affixed to windows
or doors.
   (b)   Structural Support Not Included In Sign Area. The supporting structure
or bracing of a sign shall not be computed as part of the sign area, unless
such supporting structure or bracing is made a part of the sign's message by
including a symbol, logo, or other three- dimensional figure. If such is the
case, a combination of regular geometric shapes which can encompass the area of
said symbol or figure shall be included as part of the total sign area
computation.
   (c)   Computation of Area of Multi-faced Signs. The sign area for a sign
with more than one (1) face shall be computed by adding together the area of
all sign faces.
   (d)   Computation of Height of Freestanding Sign. The height of a
freestanding sign shall be computed as follows:
      (1)   Sign Without Mounding. The height of a freestanding sign shall be
calculated by measuring the vertical distance between the top part of such sign
or its structure, whichever is highest, to the elevation of the ground directly
beneath the center of the sign. The elevation of the ground directly beneath
the center of the sign shall be construed to be the lower of the existing grade
prior to construction or the newly established grade after construction,
exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the
purpose of locating the sign.
      (2)   Sign With Mounding. In cases in which the newly established grade
within the required front yard consists of man-made berms, hills, or other
similar ground formations with sides steeper than one (l) foot rise to four (4)
foot horizontal, the Zoning Administrator shall utilize the elevation of the
street curb nearest to the location of the sign for determining sign height. If
no street curb exists, the elevation of the edge of pavement nearest the sign
location shall be used.
   (e)   Computation of Height of Building Signs. The height of an awning,
canopy, projecting, wall, or window sign shall be determined by measuring the
vertical distance between the top part of a sign panel or individual letter or
characters, whichever is highest, to the elevation of the ground underneath
such sign.
   (f)   Structural Support Included In Sign Height. Any material whose major
function is to provide structural support for a sign shall be considered part
of the sign for purposes of determining sign height. (Ord. 7-2009. Passed 2-2-
09.)

zoning lot, the owner of such lot shall secure a sign permit prior to such
construction, placement, erection, or modification of such sign. Sign permits
shall be issued for individual zoning lots. The property owner shall maintain
in force, at all times, a sign permit for such sign.
   (b)   Applications. All applications for sign permits of any kind shall be
submitted to the Zoning Administrator on an application form provided by the

accompanied by the applicable fees, which shall be established by the Troy City
Council from time to time by resolution.
   (d)   Completeness. Within ten (10) days of receiving an application for a
sign permit, the Zoning Administrator shall review it for completeness. If the
Zoning Administrator finds that it is complete, the application shall then be
processed. If the Zoning Administrator finds that it is incomplete, the Zoning
Administrator shall notify the applicant of the reasons the application was
deemed incomplete.
   (e)   Action. Within twenty (20) days of the submission of a complete
application for a sign permit, the Zoning Administrator shall either:
      (1)   Issue the sign permit, if the sign conforms in every respect with
the requirements of this Sign Code; or
      (2)   Reject the sign permit if such sign fails in any way to conform to
the requirements of this Sign Code. In case of rejection, the Zoning
Administrator shall specify the section or sections of the Sign Code with which
the sign application is inconsistent.
      (3)   If the Zoning Administrator rejects the sign permit, the applicant
may appeal the rejection to the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to the Zoning
Code.

owner or agent shall contact the Miami County Building Regulations Department
to apply for and obtain all necessary building permits for the sign

   (b)   Illegal Signs Not Non-conforming Signs. Any sign not lawfully existing
prior to the enactment of this Sign Code and which could not be erected in

any legal status by the enactment of this Sign Code.

   749.18 REMOVAL OF SIGNS.
   (a)   Removal of Obsolete Signs. Thirty (30) days after becoming an obsolete

becoming an obsolete sign, all obsolete signs shall be taken down and removed,
including all legible parts of the sign structure, or in the case of painted
wall signs, painted over to obliterate the obsolete message. This shall be
accomplished by the owner of the property upon which such sign is located.
After written citation and notice from the Zoning Administrator, and failure by
such sign owner or property owner to comply with such notice within fourteen
(14) days, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to cause removal of the sign
and/or sign structure, and any expense incident thereto shall be paid by the
owner of the property upon which such sign is located.
 
   (b)   Unsafe or Illegal Signs. If the Zoning Administrator or designee finds
that any sign or structure regulated herein is unsafe or illegal, written
notice or citation shall be given to the owner of the property upon which the
sign is located, noting such violation of this Sign Code and time specified to
remedy such violation. If the property owner fails to remove the sign, repair
the sign, or obtain required permits so as to comply with the requirements set
forth in the citation or notice, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to
cause removal of the sign and any expense incidental thereto shall be paid by
the owner of the property upon which the sign is located. Each day such
violation or failure to comply is continued after notification thereof shall
constitute a separate offense.
 
   (c)   Temporary Signs with Lapsed Permits. All temporary signs that were
constructed, painted, installed, or maintained in conformance with a temporary
sign permit under this Sign Code, and such permit has lapsed and has not been
renewed, shall be forthwith removed by the owner of the property on which such
sign is located. Upon failure of the owner to remove such signs, the Zoning

   (a)   A variance for location of the sign only, may be granted by the Board
of Zoning Appeals (BZA) where the strict interpretation of this chapter would
create an unusual and unnecessary hardship on the property owner or occupant
due to the unique location or physical characteristics of the property, if such
variance would not adversely affect the public interest in any substantial
manner, and if the relevant physical characteristics of the property were not
caused by a current or previous owner or occupant.
   (b)   The BZA shall not have the authority to approve any sign with a
message area exceeding that permitted by this chapter, or to permit the total
message area to exceed the allowable message area permitted by this chapter.

of this chapter, no application for a variance allowing such sign shall be

place.

variance, no subsequent application requesting the same variance shall be filed
by the applicant, whether or not the same person, firm or corporation, until
the expiration of twelve (12) months after disapproval.

Any Person owning, operating or maintaining a System without a Certificate of

and/or non- complying portion of such System; and/or prosecuting the violator.
   (f)   Future Uses. In allowing Facilities to be placed in the Rights-of-Way,
the City is not liable for any damages caused thereby to any Provider’s
Facilities that are already in place. No Provider is entitled to rely on the
provisions of this Chapter as creating a special duty or relationship to any
Provider. (Ord. 74-07. Passed 11-19-07.)
   903.05 DISCONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS, ABANDONED AND UNUSED FACILITIES.
   (a)   A Provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing operation of any
System in the City shall:
      (1)   Provide information satisfactory to the City that the Provider’s
obligations for its System in the Rights-of-Way under this Chapter and any
other chapters in the Codified Ordinances or other Laws that have been lawfully
assumed by another Applicant and/or Provider; or
      (2)   Submit a written proposal to re-use its Facilities in a manner that
promotes the City’s goals of providing innovative and economic solutions to
efficiently and economically utilize a potentially limited Rights-of-Way
capacity. Said proposal must be approved by the City Engineer; or
      (3)   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of Facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.
Said proposal must be approved by the City Engineer; or

proceeds under this clause, the City may, at its option:
         A.   Purchase the Facilities; or

reimburse the City for its reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the Facilities.
   (b)   Facilities of a Provider who fails to comply with this Section and
which remain Unused Facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned
Facilities are deemed to be a public nuisance. The City may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at Law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
abating the nuisance; or taking possession of the Facilities and restoring them
to a useable condition subject to the finding of the PUCO pursuant to the
requirements of O.R.C. Sections 4905.20 and 4905.21; or requiring removal of
the Facilities by the Provider or by the Provider’s surety. If the City
determines to require a Provider to remove Unused Facilities in any Rights-of-
Way, the City shall use reasonable efforts to direct that this removal occur in
conjunction with other scheduled excavation of the Rights-of-Way. If the City
abates the nuisance it may take all action necessary to recover its costs to
abate said nuisance, including but not limited to, those methods set forth in
O.R.C. Section 715.261.
(Ord. 74-07. Passed 11-19-07.)
   903.06  NATURE OF ISSUANCE.
   Certificate of Registration shall not convey equitable or legal title in the
Rights-of-Way. A Certificate of Registration is only the nonexclusive, limited
right to occupy Rights-of-Way in the City for the limited purposes and for the
limited period stated in the Certificate of Registration and in accordance with
this Chapter
903 and any associated Permit. For those Providers with a valid gas or electric
franchise, the provisions of a Certificate of Registration shall be deemed as
regulatory in nature and shall not be interpreted to limit the right to occupy
the Rights-of-Way which may have been granted by such franchise. The rights to
occupy the Right-of-Way itself may not be subdivided or subleased; provided,
however, that two or more Providers may collocate Facilities in the same area
of the Rights-of-Way so long as each such Provider complies with the provisions
of this Chapter. Collocating Providers may file a joint application for a
Right-of-Way Permit. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider
from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before
collocating its Facilities on Facilities of others, including the City’s
Facilities. A Certificate of Registration does not prevent a Provider from
leasing space in or on the Provider’s System, so long as the sharing of
Facilities does not cause a violation of Law, including the provisions of this
Chapter. A Certificate of Registration does not excuse a Provider from
complying with any provisions of this Chapter and other applicable Law.
(Ord. 74-07. Passed 11-19-07.)
   903.07  OTHER APPROVALS, PERMITS AND AGREEMENTS.
   In addition to a Certificate of Registration, Providers shall obtain any and
all regulatory approvals, permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for
the offering or provision of such Services from the appropriate federal, state
and local authorities and upon the City’s request, shall provide copies of such
documents to the City. Further, a Certificate of Registration issued pursuant
to this Chapter shall not entitle a Provider to use, alter, convert to, or
interfere with, the Facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines,
wires, fiber, cable, or any other real or personal property of any kind
whatsoever under the management or control of the City.
(Ord. 74-07. Passed 11-19-07.)

or not to renew.” Within thirty (30) days after receipt by the City of said
notice, and in no event later than five (5) days prior to said cancellation,
the Provider (or Applicant) shall obtain and provide to the Director a
certificate of insurance evidencing appropriate replacement insurance policies.

   Charges for water service, sewer rental, and recycling service shall be
consolidated on a single utility bill. The Director of Public Service and

obtaining readings is divided equally.
(Ord. 35-91. Passed 11-4-91.)
   909.03 RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY UTILITY BILL.
   The property owner is responsible for the payment of any and all charges
billed for water service, sewer rental and recycling service used at the

of service notice. Payment or provision for payment of all amounts appearing in
arrears including the service charge will occur prior to service being

period from date of signing the agreement.

delinquency scheduled for payment prior to July 1, 2020, the Director of Public
Service and Safety may grant an extension of time with a written payment
agreement for a period of time not to exceed 180 days and may issue grants to
delinquent utility customers if grant funding or reimbursement is available
from State or Federal sources, provided that the delinquency was substantially
related to the Covid-19 Pandemic. (Ord. 26-2020. Passed 5-18-20.)

         The Director, at his/her sole discretion, may grant a variance to a
permitted industrial user for the discharge of wastewater to the sanitary sewer
system with a pH greater than 11.0 S.U. but less than or equal to 12.0 S.U.,
under the following conditions:
         A.    The industrial user agrees to install and operate, at its cost,
equipment to continuously monitor and record the pH of the industrial user
wastewater at the point where it exits the industrial user's facility (the exit
point). The location of the exit point must be approved by the City in writing.
The industrial user shall submit such recordings to the pretreatment
coordinator within seven (7) days after the end of the month during which the
recordings are generated; and
         B.    The industrial user agrees to pay the City for all costs
incurred in televising the receiving sewers at the time of granting the
variance and at intervals thereafter as determined by the City; and
         C.    Industrial users with an average daily flow of less than 25,000
gallons per day may discharge to a pH of 12.0 S.U. for no longer than 30
minutes in a 24 hour period and no more than a total of 12 hours per calendar
month or industrial users with an average daily flow of greater than or equal
to 25,000 gallons per day may discharge to a pH of 12.0 S.U. for no longer than

month.
   No pH variance shall be issued for wastewater with a pH less than 6.0 S.U.
or greater than 12.0 S.U. Granting of a pH variance to an industrial user shall
in no way relieve the industrial user of any liability for damage to and/or the
integrity of the receiving sewer. Damage to or deterioration of the receiving
sewer due to the pH variance will be the financial responsibility of the
industrial user. Any pH variance may be revoked by the Director at any time and
for any reason. Each variance is specific to the industrial user and the
industrial user's location referred to in the request for variance. pH
variances are not transferable or assignable.
         (Ord. 50-2016. Passed 10-17-16.)

and/or pollution prevention will modify the discharge to such a degree as to be
acceptable; and/or
      (3)    Require pretreatment, handling facilities, flow equalization, or
other measures necessary to assure compliance with this chapter; and/or
      (4)    Require a person or local government unit making, causing or
allowing the discharge to pay a surcharge to cover the added cost of handling
and treating excess loads imposed on the City POTW by such discharge.
   (h)    If the Director requires pretreatment or equalization of waste flows
prior to discharge into the POTW, the plans, specifications and other pertinent
data or information relating to such pretreatment or flow control facilities
shall be submitted for review and approval. Approval shall in no way exempt the
discharge from compliance with any applicable code, ordinance, rule or
regulation of the City or any other government unit having jurisdiction. No
construction shall commence without written approval. No substantial
alterations or additions to such pretreatment or flow control facilities shall
be made without written approval of the Director.

particular tests and analyses to be made, the method and frequency of sampling
and other specific details for scheduling related thereto shall be established
by the Director to meet the requirements of the POTW operation, administrative,
and billing procedures. The Director shall be free to alter such scheduling at
any time.
   (l)    No person shall be relieved of his responsibility and shall be liable
for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the City due to an accidental
discharge. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharges of
prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this chapter at the owner
or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the City for
review, and approval before construction of the facility. No user who commences
contribution to the City after the effective date of this chapter shall be
permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge
procedures have been approved by the City. Review and approval of such plans
and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter or its subsequent revisions. (Ord. 24-2009. Passed
9-8-09.)
(1)    Notification of City. In the case of an accidental discharge, a slug
load discharge, changes in operations and/or conditions that could affect the
potential of a slug load discharge, or any other discharge that could cause
interference or pass through the POTW, it is the responsibility of the user to
immediately notify the City of the incident. The notification shall include
location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, time, and
corrective actions taken to remedy the problem(s). Within five days following
an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the City a detailed written
report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any
expense, loss or damage, fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may
be imposed.
         (Ord. 6-2018. Passed 2-5-18.)
      (2)    Notification Procedures. A notice shall be permanently posted on
the User's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to
call in the event of an accidental discharge. Employers shall insure that all
employees are advised of the emergency notification procedure. The Director
shall evaluate at least once during the period covered by each IU Discharge
Permit whether a user needs a plan to control slug and accidental discharges as
listed at 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v).
   (m)    No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently
break, damage, destroy, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or
equipment which is a part of the POTW.
   (n)    Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
      (1)    Existing sources shall comply with categorical pretreatment

applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall be considered existing IUs
except where such sources meet the definition of a new source.
      (4)    New sources shall install and have in operating condition, and
shall start-up all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable
pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest
feasible time, but not to exceed ninety days after notice, new sources must
meet all applicable pretreatment standards.
      (5)    Categorical pretreatment standards are required to be met at the
end of the regulated process or at the point of discharge from an industrial
pretreatment system prior to mixing with any other waste stream and before
discharge to the POTW.
   (o)    Dilution Prohibition. No IU user shall increase the use of process
water, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a
pretreatment standard, or any other pollutant specific limitation.
   (p)    State or Other Requirements. The most stringent of any discharge
limitations shall apply to all users, whether such limits are set by City,
State, Federal, or other regulatory agencies or entities.
   (q)    Special Agreements. No statement contained in this chapter shall be
construed as prohibiting any special agreement or arrangement between the City
and any person whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may
be accepted by the City for treatment whether with or without pretreatment,
provided that such agreement does not violate Categorical Pretreatment
Standards, and further provided that there is no interference or pass through
of the POTW by reason of the discharge of such wastes, and finally that no
extra costs are incurred by the City without reimbursement by the user.
   (r)    All or certain industrial wastes shall be excluded when conditions
are such that NPDES permit conditions cannot be met by City.
   (s)    Surcharges may be imposed by the City for any compatible pollutant
discharged to the POTW.
   (t)   No new connection may be made unless there is flow capacity available
in all downstream sewers, lift stations, force mains, and there is sufficient
wastewater treatment capacity.
   (u)    Calculation of equivalent mass and concentration limits.
      (1)    When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
Director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as a
mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual IUs.
      (2)    Equivalent limitations shall be deemed pretreatment standards for
the purposes of Section 307(d) of the Act. IUs will be required to comply with
the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards
from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
         (Ord. 24-2009. Passed 9-8-09.)
   915.06 APPROVAL OF SEWER PLANS.

guarantee that these facilities or equipment will function in the manner
described by their constructor or manufacturer, nor shall it relieve a person
of the responsibility of enlarging or otherwise modifying such facilities to
comply with this chapter or its revisions. An IU shall have an approved permit-
to-install from the Ohio EPA in their possession prior to the construction and
operation of new or modified wastewater collection, conveyance, storage,
treatment or disposal facilities. This includes facilities that handle sewage
or industrial sludge and non-discharging facilities, such as holding tanks.
      (Ord. 50-2016. Passed 10-17-16.)
 
   (d)    Discharge Permits. Any IU or any new discharger prior to connecting
to the sewer shall provide the City with sufficient information to determine if
that user is a Major Industrial User, and shall be required to obtain an IU
discharge permit. A discharge permit shall be valid for no more than five
years. If process changes are made that, in the opinion of the Director, alter
the wastewater constituents and characteristics significantly, a new
application shall be filed accordingly. Each permit shall be renewed by new
application prior to the permit's expiration. IU Discharge Permit applications
are available from the City Engineering Department. The reapplication for
renewal will be subject to fees set in Section
915.09. Nothing in a permit shall constitute an exception to the prohibitions
and limitations on wastewater admissibility as set forth herein. Contributors
are subject to all applicable fees, rates, and charges set forth in this
chapter. In support of the application, the IU shall submit, in units and terms
appropriate for evaluation, the following information:

representative of the IU.
   The City will evaluate the data furnished by the user and may require
additional information. After evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished,
the City may issue an IU Discharge Permit subject to terms and conditions
provided herein. A discharge permit may be issued to users which are not
classified as significant, informing them of general prohibitive standards,
limitations, accidental spill notification requirements, residue disposal
requirements, and potential for being sampled by the City, and other
requirements.
   (e)    Permit Modifications. The City reserves the right to amend any IU
Wastewater Discharge Permit issued hereunder in order to assure compliance by
the City with applicable laws and regulations. Within nine months of the
promulgation of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the Discharge
Permit of IUs subject to such standards shall be revised to require compliance
within the time frame prescribed by such standard. Where a user, subject to a
Categorical Pretreatment Standard, has not previously submitted an application
for a Wastewater Discharge Permit, the user shall apply for a Permit within 180
days after the promulgation of the applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. All categorical pretreatment standards adopted after the promulgation
of this section shall become part of this chapter. The user shall be informed
of any proposed changes in his permit at least thirty days prior to the
effective date of change. Any changes or new condition in the permit shall
include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
   (f)    Permit Conditions.  IU Discharge Permits shall be expressly subject
to all provisions of this chapter and all other applicable regulations, user
charges and fees established by the City. Permits may contain the following:
      (1)    Statement of the permit's duration and transferability;
      (2)    Limits on the average and maximum wastewater constituents and
characteristics;
      (3)    Limits on average and maximum rate and time of discharge or
requirements for flow regulations and equalization.
      (4)    Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and
sampling facilities; flow measuring, recording, sampling equipment; size of
manhole openings, depths, or other measurements.
      (5)    Specifications for monitoring programs which may include sampling
locations, frequency of sampling, number, types, and standards for tests and
reporting schedule;
      (6)    Compliance schedules and compliance schedule reports;
      (7)    Requirements for submission of technical reports or discharge
reports;
      (8)    Requirements for maintaining and retaining records relating to
wastewater discharge as specified by the City, and affording City access
thereto;
      (9)    Requirements for notification of the City of any new introduction
of wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character
of the wastewater constituents being introduced into the wastewater treatment
system;
      (10)    Requirements for notification of slug and accidental discharges;
      (11)    Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the City to ensure
compliance with this chapter including civil and criminal penalties;
      (12)    Requirements for the IU to prepare and submit an accidental spill
prevention plan as well as for reporting of spills of prohibited materials.
      (13)   Requirements for the IU to implement BMP’s when indicated;
   The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the
City during the term of the permit.
   (g)   Permit Transfer. Wastewater Discharge Permits are issued to a specific
user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be
reassigned, transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises,
or a new or changed operation.
   (h)    Reporting Requirements for Permittee. 
      (1)    Compliance schedule reports. IUs which are not in compliance with
this chapter must develop a compliance schedule which will allow the IU to come
into compliance with this chapter. The schedule should contain increments of
progress (hiring engineers, starting construction) which correspond to specific
dates for their completion. These represent major events leading to the
operation of pretreatment facilities to comply with this chapter. All IUs
subject to these conditions must submit a progress report to the City no later
than fourteen days following each date in the compliance schedule. This report
shall state whether the IU complied with the increment of progress to be met on
that date, the reason for delay if the date was not met, and the steps being
taken to return to compliance. In no event can more than nine months elapse
between progress reports. Compliance schedules shall be developed in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.12(b).
      (2)    Self monitoring report. All SIUs may be required to conduct self-
monitoring and submit self-monitoring reports to the City to assess and assure
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements as specified
in each user’s discharge permit. The SIU may be granted a monitoring waiver if
it can demonstrate through sampling and other technical factors that the
pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is
present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in
the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. The SIU has the option
to request that Troy perform all required self monitoring in lieu of the SIU.
Sampling for all periodic reports must be performed during the time period
covered by the report.
      (3)    Baseline monitoring report. At least ninety days prior to
commencement of discharge, new sources and sources that become IUs subsequent
to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to
submit to the Director a Baseline Monitoring Report, containing the information
required in 40 CFR 403.12(B)(1)-(5), and a permit application in accordance
with subsection (e) hereof.
      (4)    Compliance report. Within ninety days following the date for final
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new
source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW,
any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Director a report containing the information listed in 40 CFR 403.12. For IUs
subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established by the Director,
this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long term
production rate. For all other IUs subject to categorical pretreatment
standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of
production, the report shall include the user's actual production during the
appropriate sampling period. The report shall state whether the applicable
Pretreatment Requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional O&M and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the IU into compliance
with the applicable Pretreatment Requirements. This statement shall be signed
by an authorized representative of the Industrial User.
      (5)    Reporting, sampling and analyses.
         A.   Reports of IU’s shall contain the results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and nature and concentration, or
production and mass where requested by the Director, of pollutants contained
therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The
frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the IU’s discharge permit. Where
the Director has imposed compliance with a Best Management Practice or
pollution prevention alternative, the IU shall submit documentation as required
to determine compliance with the IU’s discharge permit. Where the Director has
allowed a monitoring waiver for a specific parameter, the IU shall submit a
certification statement with each report indicating that there has been no
increase in the levels of that parameter due to the activities of the IU. Where
the Director has imposed mass limitations on IU’s as provided for by Section
915.05(u), the report shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated. All
analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the
Administrator pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR 136
and amendments thereto and with any other test procedures approved by the
Administrator. Where the IU has been classified as a Non-Significant
Categorical Industrial User the IU must submit an annual certification
statement, with appropriate justification, that indicates the facility:
            1.   Meets the requirements of a Non-Significant Categorical
Industrial User;
            2.   Is meeting all pretreatment standards and requirements; and
            3.   Did not discharge more than 100 gallons of total categorical
wastewater on any day.
         B.   Notification of Violation and Resampling. If self monitoring
performed by an IU indicates a violation, the IU shall notify the Director
within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall
also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the Director within thirty days after becoming aware of the initial
violation. If a violation is detected through sampling and analysis conducted
by the POTW in lieu of the industrial user, the POTW shall perform the repeat
sampling and analysis within thirty days of becoming aware of the violation
unless it notifies the IU of the violation and requires the IU to perform the
repeat sampling and analysis.
         C.    If an IU monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by
the Director, using the procedures prescribed above, the results of that
monitoring shall be included in the report.
          D.    Each major SIU shall comply with the hazardous waste
notification requirement found at 40 CFR 403.12(p).
 
   (i)    (Reserved for future use.)
 
   (j)    Permit Fees. Permit fees for major contributors shall be established
for an initial permit application and a permit reapplication as set forth in
this chapter.
 
    (k)    Surveillance of SIUs. Surveillance of SIUs for the purposes of
verifying industry self-monitoring information and compliance with this chapter
will be done at such intervals as determined by the Director to be necessary to
determine compliance with applicable pretreatment requirements and regulations.
   (1)    Monitoring of SIUs. An SIU shall install at its own expense suitable
control manhole, together with such necessary appurtenances in or on each
building lateral to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastewater, and such sampling devices as may be reasonably necessary, unless
otherwise instructed by the Director. Such manholes and sampling and testing
devices shall be provided and maintained to the Director's satisfaction at the
expense of the user, but shall be under the control of the City. Monitoring
equipment shall, unless otherwise and specified by the City, include a device
for automatically measuring and recording flow and provisions for taking
samples as required. There shall be ample room in or near the sampling facility
to allow for safe access for the purpose of determining compliance with this
chapter. The facilities shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with
all applicable local construction codes and specifications.
   (m)    Laboratory Procedures and Analysis. Laboratory procedures used in the
examination of industrial wastes shall be those set forth in 40 CFR 136.
Alternative methods for certain analyses may be used subject to mutual
agreement provided they meet USEPA requirements and subsection (i) above. The
City shall charge to the user, the standard initial analyses of the user's
wastes as well as other nonstandard tests as required by the user's specific
process waste loading. All such analyses shall be binding in determining
strength of wastes surcharges and other matters dependent upon the character
and concentration of wastes.
(Ord. 24-2009. Passed 9-8-09.)
 
   (n)    Representative Sample. Compliance with this chapter shall be based
on, in part, the analysis of a representative sample of an IU's wastewater
discharge.
      (1)   Except as indicated in Section (2) and (3) below, the User must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Director, the samples must be representative of
the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified
in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples
collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as
follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited
in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease,
the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Director as appropriate. In
addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous
Limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in TCO 915.07 (h) (3) (4), a minimum of four (4)
grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data
are available, the Director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports
required by paragraph 915.07 (h) (2) and (5) A., the Industrial User is
required to collect the number of grab and/or composite samples necessary to
assess and assure compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and
Requirements.
         (Ord. 6-2018. Passed 2-5-18.)
   (o)    Data Inspection and Review. All data collected pertaining to
industrial wastes including records kept by each IU shall be subject to
inspection and review by the City upon request.
   (p)    Confidential Information. Information and data furnished to the City
with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be available to the
public or other government agency without restriction unless the discharger
specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
City that the release of such information would divulge trade secrets or
proprietary information. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not
be recognized as confidential information. Information accepted by the City as
confidential shall be made available to governmental agencies upon written
request.
   (q)    Industrial Pretreatment Residues. Sludge from an industrial or
commercial pretreatment system or liquid wastes and industrial sludges
transported by waste haulers shall not be placed into the POTW. Such sludge and
wastes shall be disposed of by a licensed hauler in a site approved by the OEPA
in accordance with requirements of Section 402(b) and 405 of the Act and
Sections 3001, 3004, and 4004 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended by the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA, PL 94-580).
   (r)    Signatory Requirements for IU Reports. Any IU submitting a report
required by Section
915.07 shall include the following certification statement as set forth in 40
CFR 403.6 (a)(2)(ii): "I certify under penalty of law that this document and
all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance
with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted and is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations." The report shall be signed by an
authorized representative, or duly authorized representative as noted in 40 CFR
403.12(1).
(Ord. 24-2009. Passed 9-8-09.)
   915.08 APPLICATION OF SEWER SERVICE CHARGES.
   (a)    Every person whose premises are served by a sewer connection which
discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids, either
directly or indirectly into the POTW, will be charged for the sewer service and
for the treatment of such discharges.
   (b)    The sewer service charge will be applied to each and every premises
having a sanitary sewer connection as of the beginning of the next regularly
scheduled billing period following the completion of the building sewer
connection.
   (c)    The sewer service charge shall consist of a minimum charge and a
commodity charge. The minimum charge shall be based on the size of the water
meter(s) used at the premises served. The commodity charge shall be based on
the quantity of water used, as measured by the water meter(s). The meter(s)
shall be acceptable in design and type to the City.
   (d)    When a premises is served by more than one water meter a minimum and
commodity charge will be made for each meter.
   (e)   When a premise is supplied in whole or in part with water from wells
or any source other than the public water supply, and which discharges to the
POTW, such wells or other source shall be registered in writing to the City.
The owner of the premise shall install and maintain at his expense a meter or
meters acceptable to the City on all such supplies and the quantity of water
used shall determine the sewer service charge as measured by the meter or
meters. The meter size shall determine the minimum charges and tap-in charge.
   (f)   When a person can show to the satisfaction of the Director that a
portion of the water measured by the water meter does not enter the POTW, the
person may apply for the installation of an auxiliary water meter. The Director
has the authority to require additional metering to be installed at the
applicant's expense, so as to measure the quantity of water actually entering
the POTW. Such meters shall be installed and maintained at the expense of the
property owner. Venturi meters, flumes, weirs and other methods of measuring
flow shall be used only when authorized by the Director. Existing auxiliary
meters may be continued in use on a conditional basis. Such meters are subject
to a test and replacement when so ordered by the Director. All costs shall be
the property owner's responsibility. Where an auxiliary meter has been
installed, such a meter shall not be removed without the approval of the
Director. All meters shall be installed in accordance with the standards, rules
and regulations of the City.
   (g)   When a well or wells are used as a supplementary water supply and are
used for a period not exceeding six months in any calendar year, the minimum
portion of the sewer service charge may be waived by the Director for the
period of nonusage subject to such requirements has he may deem necessary.
   
   (h)   Where the City makes an adjustment in the water charges as a result of
water leakage, an appropriate adjustment in the sewer service charges may be
made.
   (i)   (Reserved for future use.)
   
   (j)   Exemptions from the sewer service minimum charges for unused service
branches, stand-by service branches and new service branches under construction
shall be made in the same manner as exemptions from water minimum charges for
theses services as is currently in effect at any particular time.
   (k)   Fire protection service branches shall be exempt from all sewer
service charges, except when overflow, test waste, or other nonfirefighting
flows enter the POTW.

(Ord. 50-2022. Passed 9-19-22.)
 
 
   (d)    The foregoing rate schedules shall be considered as the base rates
for any lot, parcel of land, building or premises situated within the corporate
limits of the City and having any connection with or accessible to the POTW or
otherwise discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other
liquids, directly or indirectly into the POTW.
   (e)    Maximum billings for sewer charges for individual residential units
for the summer months of June, July, August and September will not exceed the
average billing of such charges for the preceding eight months at the
residential unit. An occupant shall have lived at such unit's location
throughout said preceding eight month period to qualify for such summer
average.
   (f)    For any lot, parcel of land, building or premises situated outside
the corporate limits of the City and having any connection to the POTW or
otherwise discharging sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly into the POTW, the minimum and commodity
charges shall be determined in the same manner as set forth in Section
915.08, but the rates established in subsections (b) and (c) above shall be
increased by twenty-five percent (25%).
   (g)    The charges pursuant to this chapter shall be collected by the
Billing and Collection Office. The Director shall make and enforce such rules
as may be deemed necessary for the regulation, collection, rebating and
refunding of such sanitary sewer service charges. The charges shall be payable
monthly at the end of the billing period at the same time as water bills. The
period, within which payment shall be made in order to be classified as a
prompt payment, shall be determined by the Director and shall be expressed
through the rules which he is authorized by this chapter to make for the
purpose herein. In addition to the charge determined according to the rates
specified herein, a further charge of ten percent of such amount shall be added
in each case of failure to make prompt payment and the total thus obtained
shall be the sewer charge for late payment.
   (h)    A minimum charge shall be levied and assessed upon any lot, building
or premises connected with the City sanitary sewer system. Should the measured
service exceed the minimum quantity, the corresponding commodity charges shall
be applied in addition to the minimum.
   (i)    Each charge levied by or pursuant to this chapter is hereby made a
lien upon the corresponding lot, land or premises served by a connection to the
POTW. If the same is not paid within ninety days after it is due and payable,
it shall be certified by the Director to the County Auditor, who shall place
the same on the tax duplicate of the County with the interest and penalties
allowed by law and be collected as other taxes are collected.
   (j)    The funds received from the collection of the charges authorized by
this section shall be deposited with the City Treasurer and shall be accounted
for and be known as the Sanitary Sewer Fund and, when appropriated by Council,
shall be available for the payment of the cost and expense of management,
operation, maintenance, repair and improvement of the POTW. Any surplus in such
fund shall be used for the payment of the interest on bonds issued and
outstanding or which may be issued to provide funds with which to pay the cost
of constructing, enlargement, or replacement of the POTW, and to retire such
bonds when they mature.
   (k)    All government entities, as owners of benefitted property, shall pay
for the use of the POTW, rates, charges and rentals as detailed above. (Ord. 2-
00. Passed 2-22-00.)
   (1)    Any person who desires permission to connect to and use the POTW
shall pay a connection or tap-in charge according to the following schedule:
      (1)    Each applicant for sanitary sewer service, other than an applicant
for a replacement connection or tap, shall pay the City a sewer tap-in charge
as provided by resolution from time to time.
         (Ord. 28-2009. Passed 11-16-09.)
      (2)    Any applicant whose property abuts an existing sanitary sewer line
paid for by the City and which property did not participate in the cost of such
facility shall pay an additional connection charge of one thousand dollars
($1000.00) per connection.
      (3)    There shall be no additional connection or tap-in charge for a
replacement connection or tap. However, a permit shall be applied for and
inspection of connections must be made by City.
      (4)    Applications shall be made to the Director according to such forms
and with such information as shall be required by the Director. Applications
can only be made and signed by a licensed master plumber.
      (5)    All connection charges paid shall be placed in the Sanitary Sewer
Fund.
         (Ord. 2-00. Passed 2-22-00.)
   915.11 INSPECTION AND CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)    All building sewers which will connect either directly or indirectly
into the POTW shall be inspected by and subjected to testing under the
supervision of the City or its designated representatives. Building sewers or
laterals shall comply with City construction regulations. See Section
915.04(g) for more specific lateral construction requirements.
   (b)    No sewer shall be acceptable to or accepted by the City without its
written approval.
(Ord. 8-96. Passed 2-5-96.)
   915.12 POWERS AND AUTHORITY.
   (a)    Entrance onto Property. A user shall allow the Director to enter upon
the premises of the user during any reasonable hour for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, and records examination and copying to determine
compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Where the user has security
measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before
entry, the user shall make necessary arrangements so that the Director will be
permitted entry without delay. The City shall have the right to set up on the
discharger's property necessary devices to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring, metering operations, or all of these.
   (b)    The Director shall have the authority to initiate and issue
enforcement actions for violations of this chapter.
(Ord. 8-96. Passed 2-5-96.)
   915.13 FAILURE TO COMPLY.
   (a)    Sewer Service Suspension. The City may suspend the sewer service and/
or an IU Discharge Permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of
the City, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or
may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes a
violation of any condition of the City's NPDES Permit. Any person notified of a
suspension of the sewer service and/or the IU Discharge Permit shall
immediately stop or eliminate the discharge of wastewater to the POTW. In the
event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the City shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize danger to the POTW or
endangerment to any individual. The City shall reinstate the IU Discharge
Permit and/or the sewer service upon proof of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any further occurrence shall be submitted to the City prior to
reinstating sewer service.
   (b)    Revocation of Permit. Any user who violates the conditions of this
chapter, refuses reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring, violates conditions of a discharge permit or any
final judicial order entered with respect thereto, or violates applicable State
and Federal regulations, is subject to having the user's discharge permit
revoked.
   (c)    Notice of Violation. Whenever the Director finds that any user has
violated or is violating this chapter, IU Discharge Permit, or any prohibition,
limitation or requirements contained herein, the City may serve upon such
person written notice either personally or by regular mail, stating the nature
of the violation. Within ten days of the date of receipt of the notice, a
written response shall be submitted by the User to the Director advising of its
position with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties may meet to
ascertain the veracity of the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan
for the satisfactory correction thereof.
   (d)    Show Cause Hearing. Where any violation of this chapter is not
corrected by timely compliance, the Director may order the user to show cause
before the City why the proposed permit revocation or other additional
enforcement actions should not be taken. A written notice shall be served
specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the City regarding the
violation; why the enforcement action is taken; the proposed enforcement
action; and directing the user to show cause why such action(s) should not be
taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served no less than ten days before
the hearing.
   Service may be made on any agent, officer, or authorized representative of
the user. The proceedings at the hearing shall be considered by the City which
shall then enter appropriate orders with respect to the activities of the user,
and serve such orders onto the user in writing. Appeal of such orders may be
taken by the user in accordance with applicable law.
   (e)    Judicial Proceedings. Following the entry of an order by the City
with respect to the conduct of a user contrary to the provisions of this
chapter, the Director of Law may, following the authorization of such action by
the City, commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in
the appropriate court.
   (f)    Right of Appeal. Any user or any interested party aggrieved by the
denial of an application for a discharge permit, by the terms and conditions
imposed with respect to any discharge permit, or by any enforcement
determination made pursuant to this chapter, may file an appeal with the
Director. Appeals shall be perfected within thirty days to the Director by
filing a written notice. The appeal must state the action or actions appealed
from, and must contain a short, plain statement of the reason or reasons why
the person believed the action to be incorrect. The Director may respond to the
appeal in writing or schedule a hearing within fifteen days of receiving said
appeal. The Director's decision on the appeal is final. Appeal of any final
judicial order entered pursuant to this chapter may be taken in accordance with
local and state law.
   (g)    Operating Upsets. Any user which experiences an upset in operations
which places the user in a temporary state of non-compliance with this chapter
or a permit issued pursuant hereto shall inform the City immediately. Where
such information is given orally, a written follow-up report shall be filed by
the user within five days.
   (h)    Bypass. Bypassing is prohibited and the Director may take enforcement
action against a user for a bypass unless:
      (1)    Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
      (2)    There was no feasible alternative to the bypass; however, this
condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been
installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgement to prevent bypass
which occurred during periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance;
and
      (3)    The industrial user submitted proper notice of bypass.
         A.   The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed above. If an IU knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the Director, if possible at least ten days before
the date of bypass. An IU shall submit oral notice of an anticipated bypass
that exceeds pretreatment limits to the POTW and Director within twenty-four
hours from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
as described in 40 CFR, 403.17(c) shall also be provided within five days of
the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. An IU may allow any bypass to
occur which does not cause pretreatment limits to be violated, but only if it
is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are
not subject to the provisions listed above.
   (i)    SNC Publication. The City shall publish a list in the largest daily
newspaper served by the POTW by the date specified in the City's current NPDES
permit of all IUs who are in significant noncompliance with pretreatment
requirements as defined at Section
915.01(b)(72).
   (j)    Enforcement Response Plan. The City shall develop and implement an
enforcement response plan (ERP) approved by the OEPA. The purpose of this ERP
shall be to identify IU noncompliances with this chapter or applicable permit
requirements, select an appropriate enforcement response, and resolve
noncompliance in a timely, fair and consistent manner. This plan may include
enforcement actions such as, but not limited to, the following: courtesy phone
call; notice of violation; administrative order; administrative fine; sewer
and/or potable water service termination; civil or criminal penalties; referral
to OEPA; and publication in the largest daily newspaper within the City's
service area.
(Ord. 8-96. Passed 2-5-96.)
   915.14 RECORDS RETENTION.
   All users subject to this chapter shall retain and preserve for no less than
three years any
records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and all
summaries thereof, relating to monitoring, sampling and analyses made by or on
behalf of a user in connection with its discharge. The records retention
requirement shall also include any records, as required by the Director, of
Best Management Practices pertaining to the users discharge. All records which
pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative adjustment or any
other enforcement obligation activities brought by the City pursuant hereto
shall be retained and preserved by the User until all enforcement activities
have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and all
appeals have expired.
(Ord. 6-2018. Passed 2-5-18.)
   915.15 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision, paragraph, word, or section of this chapter is invalidated
by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions, paragraphs,
words, or sections shall not be affected and shall continue in full force and
effect.
(Ord. 8-96. Passed 2-5-96.)
   915.99 ADMINISTRATIVE, CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.
   (a)    Administrative Fine. Whoever violates any provision of this chapter
may be assessed an administrative fine by the Director in accordance with State
and Federal law and this chapter not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00)
nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Each day of occurrence shall be
considered a separate offense.
   (b)    Injunctive Relief. Whenever an IU has violated or continues to
violate the provisions of this chapter or permit or order issued hereunder, the
Director, through counsel may petition the Court for the issuance of a
preliminary or permanent injunction or both, as may be appropriate, which
restrains or compels the activities on the part of the IU.
   (c)    Civil Penalties.
      (1)    Any industrial user who has violated or continues to violate this
chapter or any order or permit issued hereunder, shall be liable to the City
for a civil penalty in accordance with State and Federal law plus actual
damages incurred by the POTW per violation per day for as long as the violation
continues. In addition to the above described penalty and damages, the City may
recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated
with the enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
      (2)    The Director shall petition the Court to impose, assess, and
recover such sums. In determining amount of liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the industrial user's violation, corrective
actions by the industrial user, the compliance history of the user, and any
other factor as justice requires.
   (d)    Criminal Penalties.
      (1)    Any industrial user who willfully or negligently violates any
provision of this chapter or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a first degree misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not
to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation or imprisonment for not
more than six months or both.
      (2)    Any industrial user who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan or
other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or
wastewater permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders
inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter shall,
upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000) per violation or imprisonment for not more than six months or both.
   (e)    The above penalties shall in no way relieve any person from being
liable for any expense, loss or damage occasioned the City by reason of such
violation.
   (f)    Prior to the application of any of the above prescribed penalties,
the person found in violation will be notified, in writing, by the City
advising the person of the action to be taken. The person may be granted a
period of time in which to effect the remedial measures. Thereafter, further
violations shall be subject to enforcement action.
   (g)    Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to preclude the
institution of any legal action nor relieve any user from any responsibility,
liability, or penalty established pursuant to any applicable Federal, State or
local law or regulation. This shall include the possible imposition of criminal
and/or civil penalties, including the authority of the City to collect costs of
damage to the POTW as a result of any user failing to obey the terms and
conditions of this chapter and any permit issued pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 8-96. Passed 2-5-96.)
CHAPTER 917
Sale of City Utilities
917.01    Prohibition against expenditure of surplus proceeds of sale of public
utility.
   917.01 PROHIBITION AGAINST EXPENDITURE OF SURPLUS PROCEEDS OF SALE OF PUBLIC
UTILITY.
   In the event that any municipally owned public utility is sold, the proceeds
of sale shall be applied as follows:
   (a)    Such proceeds of sale shall be paid into the Sinking Fund or Bond
Retirement Fund to the extent necessary to provide for the retirement of the
outstanding indebtedness incurred in the construction or acquisition of such
public utility sold.
   (b)    The balance of such proceeds shall be paid into a special fund for
the construction or acquisition of permanent improvements and shall be invested
as provided by law. The earnings or interest of such invested proceeds shall be
paid into the General Fund or such other funds as Council may, from time to
time, direct. The principal of such invested proceeds shall be expended only as
may be, from time to time, approved by a majority of the electors of the City
on a proposed expenditure from such funds.
   (c)    Council may, by ordinance, propose expenditure from the special fund
for the construction or acquisition of permanent improvements; provided,
however, that any such ordinance shall require the submission of such question
to the electors of the City under subsection (d) hereof and its approval by a
majority of such electors.
   (d)    Council shall, by ordinance, propose expenditure from such funds upon
petition of such of the electors of the City who constitute ten percent of the
number of electors who voted for governor at the last regular or general
election. The question shall be submitted to the electors in substantially the
following form:
      "Shall expenditure be made from the invested funds from the sale of (name
of public utility or utilities sold) for the purpose of (purpose of proposed
expenditure)."
      The question shall be submitted to the electors at the next regular or
general election if one shall occur not less than sixty, nor more than 120 days
after its passage; otherwise, Council, may, upon a majority vote, provide for a
special election upon such issue. In the event a majority of the electors
voting upon such question approve the proposed expenditure, the proposed
expenditure shall be made.
         In the event a majority of electors voting upon such question do not
approve the proposed expenditure, it shall not be made.

are divided into the following categories:
         A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map
and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
         B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
         C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does

written report evaluating the Preliminary Plan's conformance with the adopted
subdivision design standards, the City's Comprehensive Plan, the City's Zoning
Code, Preliminary Plan requirements, and/or any other reports or plans that may
have been adopted. The City's Authorized Agent shall submit this report to the
Planning Commission when it reviews the Preliminary Plan. Before presentation
to the Planning Commission, the Preliminary Plan shall be reviewed by the
subdivision review staff and the Park Board. Pertinent information regarding
the application shall also be forwarded to any county, state or federal
agencies responsible for issuing permits.
(Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)

footprints may be required;
   (g)   The layout, proposed names and right-of-way widths of all proposed
streets, alleys, sidewalks and easements (including but not limited to water,
sanitary sewer, stormwater and drainage). Such proposed names shall not be so
similar to the name of other streets as to cause confusion, or be considered,
in the discretion of the City's Authorized Agent, to be inappropriate.
   (h)   Where a newly constructed street will extend an existing street, the
existing street name shall be used rather than assigning a different name to
the new section.
   (i)   The layout, numbers and approximate dimensions of proposed lots and
the total number of lots for the proposed subdivision.
   (j)   All parcels of land temporarily reserved or intended to be dedicated

   (o)    A vicinity sketch showing the subdivision as it relates to the
surrounding area at any scale. (Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)
   1117.05 LOTS.
   The following requirements shall be taken into consideration when submitting
the Preliminary Plan:
   (a)   In addition to meeting all minimum standards identified in the City's
Zoning Code, the size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for
the location of the proposed subdivision and for the type of the development
planned.
   (b)   Excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided unless
authorized by the Planning Commission. A proportion of not less than three to
one (3 to 1), nor more than three and one-half to one (3-1/2 to 1) shall
normally be considered as appropriate.
   (c)   Every lot shall abut on a publicly dedicated street or public/private
access easement.
   (d)   Dual access on double frontage residential lots shall not be
permitted.
   (e)   Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles to the right-of-
way line of the street on which the lot faces or radial to the curve.
   (f)   In order to minimize curb cuts and improve traffic safety, lots which
front on arterial streets shall establish access from a side street or alleyway
whenever feasible.
   (g)   For lots on a cul-de-sac, lot frontage shall be not less than forty
(40) feet at the right-of-way line and not less than the minimum lot width
required by the Zoning Code at the front yard minimum setback line and at the
rear yard minimum setback line.
   (h)   All lots in a subdivision must meet the applicable zoning requirements
and be buildable lots. Detention and retention areas may be excluded from this
requirement. (Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)
   1117.06  COMMON OPEN SPACE/PARKLAND.
   (a)   The subdivision layout should conform to the City's Comprehensive
Plan, Zoning Code and any other officially adopted long-range plans of the
City.
   (b)   Where deemed appropriate by the Planning Commission, open space
consisting of at least three percent (3%) of total acreage proposed for
development, which is suitably located for future use as parks, playgrounds,
and/or other recreational purposes for local or neighborhood use, shall be
provided for in the proposed subdivision. The Planning Commission may agree to
accept private open space in lieu of public parkland or fees-in-lieu-of. If
such open space is not dedicated to the City, it shall be reserved for the
common use of all property owners in the proposed subdivision by covenant on
the final record plat or in individual deeds. Such private open space shall be
maintained and operated by the Homeowners or Property Owners Association. Any
portion of the water retention or detention areas that is in excess of the
design requirements in the stormwater regulations may be included in
calculating the open space requirement; provided those needs serve more than
just the basic stormwater needs of the development.
   (c)   Where no open space is provided and no public parkland is dedicated,
the developer shall pay fees-in-lieu of. This fee shall be determined by City
Council.
   (d)    Public Parkland.  Land dedicated as public parkland shall be left
free of all building debris and shall be graded and seeded in a manner
acceptable to the City's Authorized Agent.
(Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)
   1117.07  TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES.
   (a)   Traffic Impact Studies (TIS) can be a valuable planning tool for the
City. When requested by the subdivision review staff or City Engineer, a
traffic impact study allows the City to better understand the impact a proposed
development will have on adjacent roads, intersections, and site access
driveways before the Planning Commission or City Council approves the
development. This type of planning provides the ability to make modifications
to the proposed plans and/or plan for the mitigation of the traffic impact
prior to the development being constructed. Studies shall be commissioned by
the City to a Traffic Engineer approved by both the City and the developer, and
paid for solely by the developer.
   (b)   Important questions that may be answered by a TIS:
      (1)   Are the number of access points the minimal necessary to serve the
project without negatively impacting the flow of traffic along arterial
streets?
      (2)   Are the proposed access points a sufficient distance from
intersections to minimize conflicts?
      (3)   Are proposed access points adequately spaced from other access
points along the street?
      (4)   Should left turns be restricted by signs, channeled driveways, or
the installation of a median?
      (5)   Have other methods of access, such as shared driveways, frontage
roads or access off a side street been evaluated?
      (6)   Is the sight distance adequate at proposed access points?
      (7)   Are deceleration lanes necessary?
      (8)   Is the throat length at the driveway sufficient to minimize
conflicts within the site?
      (9)   Can trucks and waste-hauling vehicles easily access the site and
circulate to and from loading areas?
      (10)   Is the design sensitive to pedestrian or bicycle needs?
   (c)   The TIS guidelines presented in this section will perform the
following functions:
      (1)   Establish standards of study;
      (2)   Ensure that important traffic concerns are addressed;
      (3)   Provide staff with a check list for the review process;
      (4)   Promote an increased understanding of traffic impact issues for
those involved in the development process.
   (d)   A full or partial TIS will be required for any proposed development
when the City Engineer has determined, after receiving input from the
subdivision review staff, that street capacity and/or safety are concerns, or
when a proposed development will generate 100 or more added new peak hour trips
to or from the site during the adjacent roadway's peak hours or the
development's peak hour.
   (e)   The use of the 100-vehicle threshold is reasonable because in an hour
an additional 100 vehicles can:
      (1)   Change the level of service at an intersection;
      (2)   Require the addition of turn lanes to accommodate site traffic
while not impacting through traffic;
      (3)   Lead to a need for additional traffic control measures such as stop
signs, blinking lights, and/or traffic signalization;
      (4)   For residential developments, 100 peak hour traffic trips are
likely to be generated by:
         A.   150 single-family detached homes;
         B.   245 apartments; or
         C.   295 town home condominiums.
      (5)   For commercial development, 100 peak hour traffic trips are likely
to be generated by:
         A.   A 15,000 square foot shopping center;
         B.   A 37,000 square foot medical/dental office;
         C.   A 55,000 square foot general office building;
         D.   A 115,000 square foot light industrial use;
         E.   A 250,000 square foot manufacturing use;
         F.   An 85,000 square foot research and development facility;
         G.   A 4,400 square foot bank with a drive-thru;
         H.   A convenience store with five (5) gasoline pumps; or
         I.   A 5,200 square foot restaurant with a drive-through window.
   (f)   In some cases, a proposed development may generate fewer trips than
the threshold indicated above, but a safety or capacity issue in the area of
the proposed development may require a full or partial impact study for the
following reasons:
      (1)   High accident intersection or section of roadway;
      (2)   Proximity of proposed site drives to other site drives or
intersections;
      (3)   Sensitivity of adjacent neighborhoods;
      (4)   Existing or projected level of service of street(s) adjacent to the
proposed development which is unacceptable;
      (5)   High traffic volumes on adjacent roadway(s) that may impact
movement into and out of the site.
         (Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)
   1117.08 PRELIMINARY DRAINAGE.
   (a)   All proposed subdivisions shall have a storm system designed to serve
the area being developed. It shall be compatible with any adjacent storm
drainage system. The storm drainage system shall be designed in such a manner
so as to minimize the effects on all downstream properties. The preliminary
drainage plan shall show the general suitability of the proposed development to
support a stormwater management system.
   (b)   The preliminary drainage plan shall be due at the time of preliminary
plan submittal and shall reflect a two (2) foot topographical contour map which
consists of two (2) parts:
      (1)   The major system is comprised of the 100-year flood route. This
system shall be laid out in a manner which directs all excess stormwater into a
detention or retention area.
      (2)   The minor system is comprised of storm sewers, inlets, etc.
   (c)   This plan shall also include the following information:
      (1)   Detention or retention facilities that are required for each
subdivision.
      (2)   The approximate location of any 100-year flood boundary areas.
   (d)   The City's Authorized Agent may require additional information from
the developer if the site warrants such.
   (e)   The existing contours, normally with intervals of two (2) feet,
referenced to United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) Datum, as required by
the City's Authorized Agent.
(Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)
   1117.09  APPROVAL/DISAPPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY PLAN.
   (a)   At the scheduled review meeting(s), the Planning Commission may take
action as follows:
      (1)   Approve. The Commission may approve the Preliminary Plan and
authorize the developer to proceed with preparation of the construction
drawings and the final record plat(s).
      (2)   Table. The Commission may table the proposed plan for further
consideration.
      (3)   Deny.  The Commission may deny the proposed plan for failure to
comply with the regulations and standards specified herein.
   (b)   If a Preliminary Plan is tabled or denied, the developer and his
consulting engineer may resubmit a new revised Preliminary Plan. All required
revisions stipulated by the Planning Commission must be satisfied by the
developer before the Preliminary Plan can be resubmitted and reconsidered for
approval.
   (c)   There shall be no automatic approval of Preliminary Plans due to the
passage of time after submittal. Recognizing that there can be many surrounding
facts and circumstances influencing the pace at which review and approval may
be achieved, the Planning Commission shall process all such applications with
diligence and reasonable speed.
(Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)
   1117.10 RECORDING PROCESSING AND REVIEW FEES FOR PRELIMINARY PLANS.
   Fees are fixed by the City Council and shall be due and payable at the time
of submission and before review by the subdivision review staff or Planning
Commission.
(Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)

Commission may only take action as follows:
      (1)   Approve.  The Commission may recommend approval of the final record
plat, which shall be submitted to City Council. The recommendation of approval
of the final or record plat by the Planning Commission shall not constitute a
dedication or acceptance of any proposed street right-of-way shown on the plat.
      (2)   Table.  The Commission may table the proposed final record plat
only if the developer proceeds under Section
1117.02 (a).
      (3)   Deny. The Commission may recommend denial of the final record plat
for failure to comply with the regulations and standards specified herein. If
the Planning Commission denies the plat, then a revised final record plat may
be re-submitted to the Planning Commission for final review or can be forwarded
to City Council.
   
   (b)    If the developer proceeds in accordance with Section
1117.02 (a), there shall be no automatic approval of construction plans or
final record plats due to the passage of time after submittal. Recognizing that
there can be many surrounding facts and circumstances influencing the pace at
which review and approval may be achieved, the Planning Commission shall
process all such applications with diligence and reasonable speed. After the
submission of a preliminary plan pursuant to Section
1117.02(a), a developer may elect to withdraw its application for a preliminary
plan and elect to proceed in accordance with Section
 1117.02(b).
   (c)    If the developer proceeds in accordance with Section

maintain a clean street surface during all phases of construction. All future
plat approvals concerning the subdivision will be suspended unless the streets
are clean. In cases where streets are not kept clean after the plat has been
recorded, then work will be suspended on buildings under construction and no
new permits will be issued in that subdivision until the streets are cleaned.
It will be the responsibility of the developer to establish a method to achieve
this and, if necessary, require it of the builders.
   (f)   All ponds remaining as a part of the proposed subdivision development
shall be in an acceptable condition based on standards outlined by the NRCS

   (h)   All lots in subdivisions shall be served by public sanitary sewers and
water mains.
   (i)   Public utilities shall not be installed under private streets, located
within an appropriate easement. (Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)
   1121.02  STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)    General Statement.
      (1)   Subdivision streets are to be designed to encourage operating
speeds of approximately twenty-five (25) miles per hour. If a street has been
stubbed to the property to be developed, those streets must be continued into
the proposed development from that point. The Planning Commission has the right
to accept, deny or require that a road be connected to an existing road if it
is deemed to be in the public interest.
      (2)   The City Engineer shall have the authority to modify any
engineering or construction detail, whenever required, for the protection of
the public interest.
      (3)   Street layouts shall also be in accordance with the applicable Fire
Code.
   (b)    Layout Standards.   
       (1)   The street layout pattern of a proposed subdivision shall be in
general conformity with a plan for the most advantageous development of
adjoining areas and the entire neighborhood. Furthermore, it shall be
consistent with the City's adopted Thoroughfare Plan, , shall implement the
standards identified in the City's adopted Comprehensive Plan (including the
Complete Streets Policy), and City of Troy Construction Standards.
         A.   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, construction
and location of all streets shall conform to adopted subdivision standards
established herein. All street design shall be done in accordance with the
current Ohio Department of Transportation Location and Design Manual and the
American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials Green Book.
         B.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, such
extension is not necessary or desirable. Streets shall be in alignment with
existing planned or platted streets with which they are to connect.
         C.   Cul-de-sac streets shall generally serve fewer than 30 lots. No
subdivision consisting of ten (10) or more acres shall be approved solely with
a cul-de-sac street system.
         D.   At access points where vehicles turning to and from the roadway
will affect the capacity of the roadway, the developer shall dedicate
sufficient right-of-way and construct turning lanes or deceleration lanes as
necessary to maintain the capacity of the roadway.
         E.   Access control along major thoroughfares shall be taken into
consideration in the design of a subdivision plat.
         F.   The City may require the use of frontage roads to provide access
to property adjacent to arterial and collector streets. A frontage road is a
subsidiary road running parallel to an arterial or collector street and
providing access to properties.
         G.   Residential developments abutting arterials or collectors shall
be platted in such a manner as to buffer the impact of the heavily traveled
arterial or collector. Fronting lots on arterials or collector streets are
discouraged and will generally only be approved if there is some special
feature of the land to be subdivided.
         H.   Lots which will require the backs of homes to face a street shall
be discouraged. However, such lots may be approved if they are screened from
the adjacent street by approximately twelve to eighteen (12 to 18)-foot wide
buffer which is not less than four (4) or more than six (6) feet in height.
         I.   Curbs and gutters shall be required in all subdivisions on both
sides of each street within the subdivision.
         J.   Sidewalks of not less than five (5) feet in width shall be
provided on both sides of all newly dedicated streets. Sidewalk improvements
may also be required in all commercial and industrial subdivisions. Curb ramps
that comply with all ADA and other Federal and State regulations are to be
provided.
         K.   Residential subdivisions that abut existing thoroughfares or
collectors shall provide sidewalks along the thoroughfare or collector for the
full distance of the development.
         L.   Public access easements shall be required for private streets
serving more than one (1) occupant.
         M.   When land is being subdivided along an existing street, the City
shall require the developer to widen the street to meet current required
pavement widths as specified.
         N.   Temporary dead-end streets shall be permitted where necessitated
by the design of the subdivision, provided that a temporary turnaround shall be
constructed where lots are fronting on such temporary dead-end streets. In such
instances, the turnaround size shall meet applicable Fire Codes.
         O.   The dedication of half or partial streets may not be permitted
except when a half or partial street exists adjacent to the tract to be
subdivided, and a partial dedication will complete or supplement the existing
street or street right-of-way.
   (c)    Intersections.
      (1)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right
angles as topography and other factors of good design permit. Interconnecting
streets shall be promoted in relatively flat areas and in all areas adjacent to
neighborhoods already exhibiting such a street system.
      (2)   Curb lines at intersections shall be rounded to a minimum radius of
twenty-five (25) feet, and property lines at intersections to a minimum radius
of fifteen (15) feet.
      (3)   The approach to an intersection shall be perpendicular to the
intersected street for a distance of not less than 100 feet from the centerline
of the intersected street.
      (4)   Offset streets of less than 125 feet from centerline to centerline
shall not be permitted.
   (d)    All street identification signs required by the City shall be
installed by the City. Street name signs shall be located and erected of a type
of material meeting the standard specifications found in the OMUTCD.
   (e)   Dual access on residential lots shall not be permitted, unless
approved otherwise for non-typical development.
(Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)
   1121.03 WATER SUPPLY IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Where a public water supply is available, as determined by the City,
every lot in the subdivision shall be provided with a connection thereto. The
developer shall bear the cost of installing all water lines inside the
subdivision and the lines to extend the water source that may be located
outside the subdivision.
   (b)   Water Main Specifications.
      (1)   Water mains in residential areas shall be eight inches (8")
minimum, and water mains in commercial/industrial areas shall be ten inches
(10") minimum unless specifically authorized by the City's Authorized Agent.
      (2)   Fire hydrants.  Fire hydrants shall be installed at total cost of
the developer throughout the subdivision with a maximum distance between such
hydrants of 500 feet in residential zones and 300 feet in commercial or
industrial zones.
   (c)   Water Easements.  Water mains installed outside the public right-of-
way shall be located in an easement having a minimum width of fifteen (15) feet
(seven and one-half (7.5) feet each side of the waterline). Private water
services installed within said easement shall extend to the edge of the
easement.
   (d)   Extension to Development Boundaries.  Water mains must be extended to
the development boundary along each public roadway within or adjacent to the
development. Other items may be required when extending to the existing system
such as replacement of the fire hydrant or adding an additional valve to the
system.    
   (e)   Oversizing. Should the City determine that a water line larger than
the minimum size is necessary for the benefit of the City and not for the
benefit of the subdivision, the City shall pay the cost of such water line
materials in excess of the minimum size. The City shall pay for the reasonable
labor costs of the construction in excess of the labor costs for the
installation of twelve (12) inches in diameter.
(Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)
   1121.04 SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Where a new subdivision is located within the City, each lot shall be
provided with a connection to the City sanitary sewer system. All sanitary
sewer lines in subdivision shall be installed by the developer with the
developer paying for all sanitary sewer lines including the cost of manholes
and manhole installation.
   (b)   Materials and specifications for the design and construction of City
sanitary sewage system as required by this section shall be in accordance with
the standards and specifications of the City of Troy. Minimum allowable size of
sanitary sewer lines shall be eight inches (8") in diameter.
   (c)   Sewer Easements: Sewers installed outside the public right-of-way
shall reside in an easement having a minimum width of twenty (20) feet (ten
(10) feet each side of the sewer). Private sewer laterals installed within said
easement shall extend to the edge of the easement.
   (d)   Extension to Development Boundaries:  All sewers shall be extended to
the upstream boundary of the property or development being served except in
those areas where the discretion of the City's Authorized Agent determines the
natural or planned topography makes it unreasonable to plan for later
extensions of the sewer.
    (e)   Oversizing. Should the City determine that a sanitary sewer line
larger than the minimum size is necessary for the benefit of the City and not
for the benefit of the subdivision, the City shall pay the cost of such
sanitary sewer line materials in excess of the minimum size. The City shall pay
for the reasonable labor costs of the construction in excess of the labor costs
for the installation of twelve (12) inches in diameter. Should the City
determine that a sanitary sewer line be installed deeper than necessary for the
benefit of this subdivision, the City shall pay the reasonable labor costs of
the construction in excess of the labor costs for the installation of the
deeper sanitary sewers.
(Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)
   1121.05  NON-CITY UTILITIES.
   (a)   Utility Line Placement.  The City shall encourage the underground

1123.05    Compliance responsibility.
1123.06    Maintenance of the stormwater system.
   1123.01  INTENT AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The intent of this chapter is to protect the land and water resources
of the City by establishing standards to achieve a level of soil erosion and
stormwater control that will minimize and abate degradation of land and water
resources and damage to public and private property resulting from earth
disturbing activities. Definitions for this section are as defined previously
in Section
 1111.06, Definitions. In addition this regulation further intends to:
      (1)   Assure that those involved in earth disturbing activities minimize
both soil erosion and the volume and rate of stormwater runoff from their
sites.
      (2)   Preserve to the extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the site and minimize the need to construct, repair, and/or
replace enclosed, subsurface storm drain systems.
      (3)   Assure that stormwater controls are incorporated into site planning
and design at the earliest possible stage and that all stormwater management
practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.
      (4)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil and to
require prompt re-vegetation and stabilization to the site following earth
disturbing activities.
      (5)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and stormwater management
practices.
      (6)   Encourage the construction of stormwater management practices that
serve multiple purposes such as flood control, erosion control, fire
protection, water quality protection, recreation, and habitat preservation.
      (7)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
groundwater recharge.
   (b)   Any person or persons proposing to develop or redevelop land within
the City for any of the uses listed in these Subdivision Regulations shall
design, develop, and submit a Site Development Plan. Said plan will be
evaluated to determine the potential for erosion, runoff, and sedimentation
impact that may result from such development activities and the need for
submission of a Stormwater Management Plan (SMP) to minimize these impacts.
   (c)   This Section shall apply to both the development and redevelopment of
land proposed for the following:
      (1)   Residential, institutional, commercial, office, and industrial
purposes, including subdivision and land development proposals for non
agricultural uses in rural areas.
      (2)   Recreational facilities, non-agricultural water impoundments and
waterway construction or improvement.
      (3)   Public infrastructure uses, including transportation and utilities.
      (4)   Any earth disturbing activity within critical and sensitive natural
areas, including floodplains, highly erodible lands (HEL) and wetlands.
   (d)   This Section does not apply to earth disturbing activities associated
with agricultural activities.
   (e)   No earth disturbing activity subject to regulation under this Section
shall be undertaken for any land proposed for development or redevelopment for
uses in these Subdivision Regulations without an approved Site Development
Plan, and, if appropriate, a Stormwater Management Plan (SMP).
   (f)   Final approval of a proposed development or redevelopment shall not be
given unless:
      (1)   A determination is made by the City's Authorized Agent based on
submission of a Site Development Plan that the proposed earth disturbing
activity will not cause accelerated runoff, erosion, and/or sediment impacts
harmful to the quality of off-site lands and waters, or
      (2)   An SMP has been approved by the City based on the recommendation of
its Authorized Agent that the proposed earth disturbing activity will not cause
accelerated runoff, erosion, and/or sediment impacts harmful to the quality of
off-site lands and waters.
   (g)   Any person or persons seeking approval for an earth disturbing
activity listed below shall prepare an SMP.
      (1)   Activities disturbing greater than or equal to one (1) acre, or
less than one (1) acre, if part of a larger common plan of development or sale.
      (2)   Activities that require the extension of public utilities (such as
roadways, water mains, sanitary sewer mains, or storm sewers).
      (3)   Activities that will modify an existing or approved drainage way,
drainage structure, or drainage easement.
      (4)   Activities that will channelize, straighten, or modify a
watercourse within the identified 100-year floodplain (studied and unstudied).
   (h)   Any person seeking approval to construct a structure shall be exempted
from having to prepare a Site Development Plan and an SMP provided they meet
all of the following:
      (1)   Construction takes place on one parcel;
      (2)   Any earth disturbing activity will not affect more than one (1)
acre of the development site at a time;
      (3)   The structure is not located within 100 feet of a sensitive natural
area;
      (4)   Any earth disturbing activity will not modify the general existing
site drainage pattern, drainage structure, drainage tiles, or drainage
easements; and
      (5)   One of the following:
         A.   Specifications are obtained and followed for controlling
potential off-site stormwater and erosion impacts from small lot building sites
as required by the City's Authorized Agent, or
         B.   The parcel is part of an overall development plan which has
received approval of an SMP and the developer certifies that they will comply
with said Plan.
   (i)   An exemption as defined above does not exempt any person from the
other provisions of this Section or liability for their activities.
(Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)
   1123.02 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   (a)   All Erosion and Sediment Kept on Site. Erosion and sedimentation
caused by accelerated wind or stormwater runoff over the site due to earth
disturbing activities shall be stabilized and confined to the boundaries of the
development site.
   (b)   Structural and Nonstructural Best Management Practices.
      (1)   Nonstructural stormwater management practices shall be used to the
maximum extent practicable. Such practices may include, but not be limited to,
preserving riparian areas, preserving existing vegetation and vegetative buffer
strips, phasing of construction, and designation of tree preservation areas.
      (2)   Nonstructural and structural stormwater management practices shall
be designed in accordance with requirements and standards specified in this
Section or by the City's Authorized Agent.
      (3)   Structural and nonstructural stormwater management practices shall
be placed in easements and recorded on the property deeds on which they are
located and shall remain unaltered unless first approved by the City's
Authorized Agent.

   (f)   Permanent Stabilization.
      (1)    A permanent vegetative cover shall be established on disturbed
areas as specified in In the NPDES Construction Activity General Permit Number
#OHC000004 or current permit.
      (2)    Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until a
ground cover is achieved which is mature enough to control soil erosion and
will survive severe weather conditions.
   (g)   Cut And Fill Slopes.  Cut and fill slopes shall be designed,
constructed and stabilized in a manner which will minimize erosion.
Consideration should be given to the length and steepness of the slope, the
soil type, upslope drainage area, groundwater conditions and other applicable
factors. If, after final grading, excessive erosion takes place, additional
slope stabilizing measures will be required by the owner, developer or builder
until the problem is corrected. The following guidelines are provided to aid in
developing an adequate design.
      (1)    Roughened soil surfaces are generally preferred to smooth surfaces
on slopes.
      (2)    Diversions should be constructed at the top of long steep slopes
which have significant drainage areas above the slope. Diversions or terraces
may also be used to reduce slope length.
      (3)    Concentrated stormwater should not be allowed to flow down cut or
fill slopes unless contained within an adequate channel, flume or slope drain
structure.
      (4)   Wherever a slope face crosses a water seepage plane which endangers
the stability of the slope, adequate drainage or other protection should be
provided.
   (h)   Protection of Adjacent Properties and Public Right-of-Ways.
Properties, public right-of-way's, and thoroughfares adjacent to the site of an
earth disturbing activity shall be protected from sediment deposition. This may
be accomplished by preserving a well-vegetated buffer at the perimeter of the
site, by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers, filters,
dikes, sediment basins, or by a combination of such measures.
   (i)   Sediment Control Structures.
      (1)    Sediment control structures shall be used to control erosion and
trap sediment on a site remaining disturbed for more than fourteen (14) days.
Such structures may include, but are not limited to, silt fences, storm drain
inlet protection, sediment basins and diversions or channels which direct
runoff to a sediment basin. All sediment control practices must be capable of
ponding runoff in order to be considered functional.
      (2)    Sediment control structures shall be constructed as a first step
in grading and be made functional before earth disturbing activities take
place. Earthen structures such as dams, dikes, and diversions shall be seeded
and mulched as soon as the installation is complete. Sediment control
structures shall be functional throughout the course of earth disturbing
activity until the site is stabilized with permanent vegetation.
      (3)    Sheet flow runoff from the site shall be intercepted by silt fence
or diversions. A silt fence shall be placed on a level contour and shall be
capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The relationship between the maximum
drainage area to silt fence for a particular slope range is shown in Table 1
below.
Table 1: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of silt fence               drainage area (percent)
0.5                                     <2%
0.25                                    > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                   > 20% but < 50%
   
      (4)    Stormwater diversion practices shall be used to keep runoff away
from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices, which include swales,
dikes or berms, may receive stormwater runoff from areas up to ten (10) acres.
      (5)    Whenever stormwater detention is required, the stormwater runoff
from the site shall pass through a sediment basin or other suitable sediment
trapping facility before discharge to a receiving water body. The City's
Authorized Agent may require sediment basins or traps for smaller disturbed
areas where deemed necessary.
   (j)   Stabilization of Waterways And Outlets. All on-site stormwater
conveyance channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow without creating erosion. Methods adequate to prevent erosion
shall also be provided at the outlets of all pipes and paved channels.
   (k)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection.  All storm sewer inlets shall be
protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter the conveyance system
without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment.
   (l)   Working In or Crossing Watercourses.
      (1)    All activities shall be kept out of watercourses to the extent
possible. Where in-channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken to
stabilize the work area during construction to minimize erosion. The channel
(including bed and banks) shall be restored to its original cross-section and
all disturbed area stabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed.
      (2)    Where a watercourse will be crossed regularly during construction,
a temporary stream crossing shall be provided, used for the shortest period
practical, removed following site construction, and restored as described in
these Subdivision Regulations.
   (m)   Maintenance and Removal of Temporary Measures.
      (1)    All temporary erosion and sediment control practices shall be
maintained and repaired to assure continual performance.
      (2)    All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be
removed within thirty (30) days after final site stabilization is achieved or
after the temporary measures are no longer needed. Trapped sediment and other
disturbed soil areas resulting from the removal of temporary measures shall
have the final grade re-established and be permanently stabilized to prevent
further erosion and sedimentation.
   (n)   Control of Construction Site Debris and Wastes.  All owners,
applicants, contractors and developers shall control waste such as discarded
building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and sanitary
waste on construction sites and shall keep streets and gutters clear of all
sediment and debris from the site.
   (o)   Use, Safety, and Maintenance of Stormwater Practices.
      (1)    Stormwater management practices shall be designed for the ultimate
use of the site and function safely with minimal maintenance.
      (2)    If an inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance, with the exception of a sediment settling pond, it must
be repaired or maintained within three days of the inspection. Sediment
settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the
inspection.
   (p)   Inspection of Stormwater Controls Required by the Developer.
      (1)    All on-site control practices shall be periodically inspected to
ensure proper function and to identify failures.
      (2)    On-site and off-site discharge locations shall be inspected to
ascertain whether erosion and sediment control measures are effective in
preventing significant impacts to the receiving waters.
      (3)    Detailed records of inspections shall be maintained for three (3)
years following the final stabilization of the site.
   (q)   Accessibility of Easements. All permanent stormwater management
measures shall have easements sufficient to cover the facility and to provide
access for inspection and maintenance.
   (r)   Status of Standards.  The standards identified in this Section are
general guidelines. Each application shall be reviewed on a case by case basis
and some may require additional and more stringent requirements, while others
may have individual requirements waived by the City's Authorized Agent. (Ord.
73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)

accommodates the surface runoff from each subdrainage unit.
            3.   Indicate, within the legend, the average percent slope,
erosion factor (K) and runoff curve number (CN) per individual subdrainage unit
for a 24-hour storm of a one (1)-year frequency.
            4.   Include a hydrograph for a 24-hour storm of the critical
frequency to be controlled and all calculations made pertinent to evaluating
the effects of the proposed development on the pre-development runoff
conditions of the site.
         B.   Calculations for the design of stormwater management facilities
shall demonstrate the following for each subdrainage unit:

same site under pre-development conditions.
            2.   Storms of less frequent occurrence than the critical storm, up
to the 100-year storm shall have its peak runoff rates no greater than the peak
runoff rates from equivalent storms under pre-development conditions.
Consideration of the 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100-year storms in design and
construction will be considered meeting this standard.
         C.   Calculation of a critical storm for each subdrainage unit of the
site shall be determined as follows:
            1.   Calculate the total volume of runoff from a one (1) year
frequency, 24 hour storm occurring on the development area before, during, and
after development by appropriate hydrologic methods, using Natural Resources
Conservation Service Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Technical Release
55, latest edition.
            2.   From the volumes determined in 1. above, determine the
percentage increase in volume of runoff due to the proposed development, and
using this percentage, select the 24 hour critical storm from this table.

CHAPTER 1125
Flood Control Standards
1125.01    General provisions.
1125.02    Administration.
1125.03    Use and development standards for flood hazard reduction.
1125.04    Appeals and variances.
1125.05    Enforcement.
   1125.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The City has special flood hazard areas that are
subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. These regulations are intended to minimize the
threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the City as
identified in Section
1125.01(f) of these Subdivision Regulations, including any additional areas of
special flood hazard annexed by the City
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are hereby
adopted by reference and made a part of this Section:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Miami County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate map Miami County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective Augusts 2, 2011, or its latest edition.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by an
Ohio registered Professional Engineer, which then has been approved by the
Floodplain Administrator as required by Section
1125.04(c) of these Subdivision Regulations.
      (4)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies, including
any Letter of Map Change issued by FEMA, are hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be a part of this Section.
      (5)   Any flood easement owned by, or dedicated by plat or deed to, the
City, Concord Township, Staunton Township, Miami County, the State of Ohio,
and/or the Miami Conservancy District.
      (6)   Any Floodplain Overlay District identified on the City Zoning Map.
      (7)   Such maps and/or studies are on file at the City of Troy, City
Hall, 100 South Market Street, Troy, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Interpreted using the Definitions set forth in Section
1111.06.
      (2)    Considered as minimum requirements;
      (3)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (4)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 73-
2021. Passed 1-18-22.)

conditions so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current
data, the following map maintenance activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the Floodplain Administrator shall ensure that
technical data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months
of the date such information becomes available. These development proposals
include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section

such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing and signed by the Mayor of
the City and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation / Detachment. Within two years after an occurrence, the
Floodplain Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing when the boundaries of
the City have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that future
FIRMs accurately represent boundaries, the Floodplain Administrator shall
include within such notification a copy of a map of the City suitable for
reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or the new area for
which the City has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory
authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/ or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1125.04, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and      
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1125.02(j)(1) of these Subdivision Regulations;
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor and the Board of Miami County
Commissioners.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine hazard areas identified by FEMA where base flood
elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated, the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one (1) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Sections
1125.03(i)(1)B.1.,
1125.03(i)(1)B.3.,
1125.03(i)(1)B.4., and
1125.03(i)(1)B.5. of these Subdivision Regulations.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
 1125.02(j)(1)A.3 of these Subdivision Regulations when an alteration of a
watercourse results in the relocation or elimination of the special flood
hazard area, including the placement of culverts.
      (4)   Compensatory Storage Required for Fill.  Fill within a special
flood hazard area shall result in no net loss of floodplain storage volume. The
volume of the loss of floodwater storage due to filling in the special flood
hazard area shall be offset by providing an equal volume of new flood storage
by excavation or other compensatory measures at or adjacent to the development
site.
   (j)   Fill.  The following standards shall apply to all fill activities in
special flood hazard areas:
      (1)   Fill sites, upon which structures will be constructed or placed,
must be compacted to 95 percent of maximum density obtainable with the Standard
Proctor Test method or an equivalent method approved by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (2)   Fill for elevating structures shall extend at least twenty (20)
feet laterally from the structure in order to establish a stable building pad.
      (3)   Fill slopes shall not be steeper than one (1) foot vertical to two
(2) feet horizontal.
      (4)   Adequate protection against erosion and scour shall be provided for
all fill slopes. When velocities exceeding five (5) feet per second are
expected during an occurrence of the base flood, rock protection or armoring
with stone shall be provided. When velocities of five (5) feet per second or
less are expected during an occurrence of the base flood, protection may be
provided by dense vegetative cover.
      (5)   Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material.
Demolition debris, trash, garbage, and other solid waste materials shall not be
used as fill.
      (6)   All fill projects shall comply with Sections
 1125.03 (i) (1) through
1125.03 (i) (4) of these Subdivision Regulations
   (k)   Storage of Materials. Outdoor storage of material or equipment not
otherwise prohibited in Section
1125.03 (a) (2) shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation.
      (Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)
   1125.04  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.  The Board of Zoning Appeals is established
as the Appeals Board for this Section. Records of appeals and variances shall
be maintained at the Troy Planning Department, City Hall, 100 South Market
Street, Troy, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1125.04(d) of these Subdivision Regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within thirty (30) days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator's decision.
      (1)   Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be
filed with the Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall
transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which the Floodplain
Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (3)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with local, state, and/or federal regulations, as
will not be contrary to the public interest where, owning to special conditions
of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee as listed in the schedule of fees adopted by the City.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community and to the surrounding property owners
at least ten (10) days before the date of the hearing.
   (3)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations, and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (5)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1125.04(d)(3)A-K of these Subdivision Regulations have been fully considered.
As the lot size increases beyond one half acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings. Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with
the rules and procedures established by the Board of Zoning Appeals for appeals
of decisions of the Zoning Administrator and for variances from the provisions
of the Zoning Code.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Miami County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in O.R.C. Chapter 2506. (Ord. 73-2021. Passed 1-18-22.)
   1125.05  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1125.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with the
Penalty section of these Subdivision Regulations.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with the Penalty section of these Subdivision Regulations.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall
give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefore and order
compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and
order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;
      (2)   Include a list of violations, referring to the section or sections
of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action which,
if taken, will affect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this
notice and order shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner,

   1131.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   The text and map of this Zoning Code are established pursuant to applicable
provisions of the Ohio Revised Code and under the Home Rule authority granted
by Article XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution. By the adoption of this
Zoning Code, the City intends to promote the health, safety, morals and general
welfare of its residents, businesses and visitors through the following
objectives:
   (a)   To prevent community needs and priorities from becoming subservient to
regional market pressures.
   (b)   To prevent hazards to the health and safety of the public and of all
occupants of improved real property.
   (c)   To assure adequate light, air and convenience of access for all
properties.
   (d)   To promote the delivery of public services such as utilities, streets,
refuse collection, emergency medical services, fire and police protection.
   (e)   To separate incompatible land uses and cluster compatible and mutually
supportive land uses.
   (f)   To create physical buffers between zones where generally beneficial,
and within zones where tensions or conflicts may occur between dissimilar land
uses.
   (g)   To provide for creatively designed single-use and mixed-use Planned
Developments, and to preserve their character and vitality through ongoing
regulatory supervision.
   (h)   To assure, through an appropriate site plan review that the general,
district and supplementary regulations of this Zoning Code are being followed
in the design of each new site improvement or redevelopment.
   (i)   To minimize adverse effects on traffic safety caused by development
and certain land uses.
   (j)   To minimize adverse effects on the environment resulting from
development and certain land uses.
   (k)   To facilitate the efficient and economical development and use of land
and public facilities.
   (l)   To allocate to each site development, rather than to the public, the
maximum feasible portion of the infrastructure and operating costs which arise
as a result of that development.
   (m)   To fairly balance the interest of property owners and occupants in
continuing their nonconforming land uses against the community interest in
achieving full compliance with this Zoning Code.
   (n)   To protect floodways and flood plains from development which increases
the general risk of flooding or puts occupants of the development at risk.
   (o)   To preserve and enhance property values.
   (p)   To protect public and private water supplies, both in quality and
quantity.
   (q)   To promote the economic vitality of business and industry.
   (r)   To direct particular land uses to the parcels of land best suited for
them physically and in terms of access to highways and public services.
   (s)   To enhance the predictability and profitability of private investments
made in the City.
   (t)   To continuously improve the aesthetic character of all parts of the
City.
   (u)   To provide for variances from certain aspects of this Zoning Code
where justified by special circumstances and where the public interest will not
be adversely affected.
   (v)   To provide for thorough, efficient and lawful Code administration.
   1131.03  RELATIONSHIP TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
   This Zoning Code is the primary means by which the City can implement its
Comprehensive Plan and accomplish the long-range goals that its citizens have
for the development and redevelopment of their community. Although the
Comprehensive Plan does not control all zoning decisions, it should be followed
to the maximum extent practicable, taking into account the current facts and
circumstances.
   1131.04 SCOPE OF REGULATIONS.
   This Zoning Code shall apply to all land that has been zoned by action of
the City Council. All property owners, lessees and other persons having a legal
or equitable interest in land subject to this Code shall comply under penalty
of law.
   1131.05 ZONING UPON ANNEXATION.
   Upon the annexation of any lands into the City, with or without an
application by the affected property owner(s), the Planning Commission shall
forthwith undertake a study to determine the most appropriate zoning for the
newly annexed lands, in view of the Comprehensive Plan of the City (hereinafter
"Comprehensive Plan"). In the event that the Comprehensive Plan does not
encompass the annexed area, the Commission may consider an appropriate
enlargement of the planning area before or after the development of zoning
recommendations for the enlargement area. The Commission shall forward its
recommendations for zoning of the newly annexed area, and any recommendations
related to enlargement of the Comprehensive Plan, to the City Council. After
notice and hearing as required by Ohio R.C. 713.12, the Council shall then
adopt City zoning for the newly annexed lands. Until City zoning is adopted,
the Miami County Zoning Regulations shall continue to be in effect for the
property in accordance with O.R.C. 303.18.
   1131.06 PROVISIONS OF ZONING CODE ARE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this Zoning Code
shall be minimum requirements. Where this Zoning Code imposes a greater
restriction or level of performance than is imposed or required by other
provisions of law or by other rules or regulations or ordinances, the
provisions of this Zoning Code shall control.
   1131.07  VALIDITY AND SEVERABILITY.
   It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that, if any provision or
provisions of this Zoning Code, or the application thereof to any zoning lot,
building, structure, or tract of land, are declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid or ineffective, in whole or in part, or to be
inapplicable to any person or situation, the effect of such decision shall be
limited to the provision or provisions which are expressly stated in the
decision to be invalid or ineffective, and shall apply only to the zoning lot,
building, structure, or tract of land immediately involved in the controversy.
All other provisions of this Zoning Code shall continue to be fully effective.

   (a)   Authorization. The Appeals Board may authorize variance from the terms
of this Zoning Code only in those specific instances enumerated in Section
1137.08(e) of this Zoning Code and then only when the Appeals Board has made

 1137.08(f) of this Zoning Code that owing to special conditions a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Code will result in practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardship for the owner, lessee, or occupant of land
or structures. The Appeals Board is without authority to consider variances
within Planned Development (PD) zoning districts, because the Planning
Commission maintains continuing jurisdiction over such districts once they are
established. Accordingly, any proposed variations from the approved final
development plan and record plan must be approved through the PD approval
process as a major or minor change and not by variance.
   
   (b)   Application. An application for a variance shall be filed in duplicate
with the Secretary of the Appeals Board. Such an application shall not be filed
until a Zoning Certificate has been applied for and refused by the Zoning
Administrator. The application shall contain the following information as well

or zoning district;
         D.   A statement showing that the special conditions and circumstances
do not result from the actions of the applicant;
         E.   A statement showing that the granting of the variance is
necessary to the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights;
         F.   An accurate list of the names and current tax mailing addresses
of all owners of property within a radius of two hundred fifty (250) feet from
the subject property; and
         G.   Such other information regarding the appeal as may be pertinent
to appropriate action by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (2)   Plot plan.  The application shall be accompanied by one (1) copy of
a plot plan drawn to an appropriate scale showing the following:
         A.   The boundaries and dimensions of the lot;

         C.   The proposed use of all parts of the lot and structures,
including access ways, walks, off-street parking, loading spaces and
landscaping;
         D.   The relationship of the requested variance to the standards set
by this Zoning Code;
         E.   The use of land and location of structures on adjacent property.
   (c)   Recommendation of Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall
provide findings of fact and make recommendations to the BZA.

a variance within thirty (30) days after the application has been filed unless
otherwise agreed by the applicant. Public notice of such hearing shall be
published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City not
less than five (5) nor more than twenty (20) days before such hearing. Such
notice shall contain the date, time, and place of the hearing, and a brief
description of the relief sought. Written notice shall be given at least five

property and owners of property directly across any street or alley, as they
appear on the application. The Appeals Board may give such additional notice as
it may from time to time by general rule provide. Any party in interest may
appear and be heard at the hearing in person or by agent.
   (e)   Authorized Variances.  Variances from the regulations of this Zoning
Code shall be granted by the Appeals Board only in accordance with the
standards set out in Section
1137.08(f) of this Zoning Code and may be granted only in the following
instances, and in no case shall the Appeals Board have authority to grant
variances as to use:
      (1)   To vary the applicable lot size requirements.
      (2)   To vary the applicable bulk regulations, including maximum height,
lot coverage, and floor area ratio, transitional yards, and minimum yard
requirements.
      (3)   To vary the applicable off-street parking and off-street loading
requirements contained in this Zoning Code.
      (4)   To vary or make interpretations regarding the sections of this
Zoning Code dealing with the following subjects wherever the provisions of this

1137.08(e) of this Zoning Code unless it evaluates the proposed variance in
view of the following criteria, and makes written findings of fact as to these
criteria and any other matters that the Board may find relevant. Variances
shall be granted only upon a determination that practical difficulties exist
with respect to the property in question that would render strict application
of the Zoning Code inequitable. In determining whether practical difficulties
exist sufficient to warrant a variance, the Appeals Board shall consider and
weigh the following factors:
         A.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         B.   Whether the variance is substantial;
         C.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
         D.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage);
         E.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restriction;
         F.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
         G.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
         H.   Practical difficulty asserted by the applicant is not similarly
existing on nearby properties or commonly occurring within the City.
         I.   The practical difficulty was not created by the acts or omissions
of any current legal or equitable owner, or by the unlawful acts of any prior
owner.
         J.   Approval of the requested variance will not materially damage the
public health, safety, morals, convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general
welfare, and adjoining properties will not suffer substantial detriment if the
variance is granted.
         K.   The requested variance would not create any material advantage
which practical difficulties do not enjoy.
         L.   The variance requested is the minimum necessary to alleviate any
practical difficulty created by the literal language of this Zoning Code. (Ord.
13-2018. Passed 4-2-18.)
   (g)   Conditions and Restrictions. In granting a variance, the Appeals Board
may impose such conditions, safeguards and restrictions upon the premises
benefited by the variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards set
out in Section
1137.08(f) of this Zoning code so as to reduce or minimize any potential
injurious effect of such variance upon other property in the neighborhood, and
to carry out the general purpose and intent of this Zoning Code.
   (h)   Decisions and Records. The Appeals Board shall render a written
decision on an application for a variance without unreasonable delay after the
close of a hearing, but in all cases, within thirty (30) days from the close of
the hearing. The Secretary of the Appeals Board shall maintain complete records
of all actions of the Appeals Board with respect to applications for variances.
   (i)   Period of Validity. No variance granted by the Appeals Board shall be
valid for a period longer than six (6) months from the date on which the
Appeals Board grants the variance, unless within such six (6) month period,
either a zoning certificate is obtained and construction, moving, or remodeling
of a structure is started; or an occupancy permit is obtained and a use
commenced. The Appeals Board may grant a maximum of two (2) extensions not
exceeding six (6) months each, upon written application, without notice of
hearing.
   (j)   Extensions. If the authorized work is suspended or abandoned for a
period of six (6) months after the time of commencing the work, the zoning
permit shall become invalid. Two (2) extensions may be granted for six (6)
months each, if requested by the owner at least ten (10) days in advance of the
expiration of the existing permit and upon the payment of a fee for each
extension as provided herein.

   (a)   Creation and Adoption. A certain map, prepared by the City, dated June
19, 2008, and which shall be amended by the City from time to time,
(hereinafter "original Zoning Map") is hereby adopted by the City Council as
the only true and accurate depiction of the configuration of zoning districts
made effective with the adoption of this Zoning Code. The original Zoning Map
and all notations and references and other matters shown thereon are made part
of this Zoning Code. This map, or a duly authenticated replacement of it, with
all subsequent amendments, shall be continuously maintained in the City offices
for reproduction purposes and the reference of interested persons. Such map
shall be captioned "Official Zoning Map of the City of Troy, Ohio." It is the
intent of this Zoning Code that the entire area under the jurisdiction of City
zoning, including all land, water areas, rivers, streets, alleys, and railroad
and other rights-of-way be included in the districts established by this Zoning
Code.
   (b)   Authentication. The original Zoning Map and any reproducible
replacement thereof, including all subsequent amendments, shall be
authenticated by the signature of the Mayor, attested to by the Clerk of
Council, under the following words: "This is to certify that this is the
official zoning map referred to in Section
1141 of the Codified Ordinances of Troy, Ohio, as adopted on or about March 16,
2009, with any subsequent amendments indicated hereon."
   (c)   Amendment. The official Zoning Map (hereinafter "the Zoning Map") may
be amended only when authorized by official action of the City Council as
provided by statute and in this Zoning Code. No new authentication of the
original reproducible Zoning Map shall be necessary following such changes, the
authorizing ordinances and map annotations being sufficient documentation.
   (d)   Replacement of Reproducible Map. The Zoning Map, as amended from time
to time, shall be maintained in a format suitable for reproduction and kept in
a place of safekeeping by the Zoning Administrator. If the original
reproducible Zoning Map must be replaced by a new base map due to loss,
destruction, excessive changes or any other reason, the superseded reproducible
map shall be retained in the permanent records of the City. The reproducible
map may be corrected for drafting or other errors and omissions only by
replacing it with a new reproducible base map. Any new reproducible base map
must be newly authenticated before it is published. With the approval of the
Zoning Administrator, the succession of reproducible base maps may be prepared
and/or preserved on electronic media, provided that the system used provides
for authentication of each new base map and effectively prevents the loss of
historical information.
   (e)   Re-drafting: Annotation.  Upon Council approval of any amendment to
the Zoning Map, the Zoning Administrator shall alter the reproducible Zoning
Map to show the amendment. Each parcel or contiguous group of parcels affected
by the rezoning shall be annotated to indicate the new zoning, the ordinance
number adopting the amendment, and the date of adoption. Such annotations shall
remain on the map through any subsequent rezonings and map re-draftings, so
that the history of zoning for each parcel is plainly evident.
   (f)   Publication.  Copies of the current Zoning Map may be distributed or
otherwise published with or without attachment to the Zoning Code.
   (g)   Rules of Interpretation. Where the Zoning Administrator determines
that there is uncertainty with respect to the intended boundaries of any of the
zoning districts shown on the official Zoning Map, and their location cannot be
determined by reference to the original enacting legislation, the following
rules shall apply:
      (1)   Where a district boundary is shown as approximately following the
centerline of a street or highway, or the right-of-way line abutting a street
or highway, or a lot line, such centerline, right-of-way line or lot line shall
be deemed to be such boundary;
      (2)   Where district boundaries are shown as approximately parallel to a
street or highway, or to the right-of-way line abutting a street or highway, or
a lot line, such boundary shall be deemed to be parallel to such centerline,
right-of-way line or lot line, at the average distance which can be scaled from
the Zoning Map;
      (3)   Where the district boundaries appear to follow a railroad line,
such boundary shall be deemed to follow the centerline of the most-used track
of such railroad line;
      (4)   Where district boundaries follow a stream, lake or other body of
water, such boundary shall be deemed to follow the edge of such water;
      (5)   Where the Zoning Administrator cannot determine the precise
location of the boundary of a district by reviewing the applicable ordinances
and/or applying these rules, the City Council shall make the determination
after requesting a recommendation from the Planning Commission and giving
notice and opportunity for a hearing to the affected property owners, all as in
a rezoning.

certificate holder, this may be, but is not required, as an intermediate step
before filing an appeal with the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (2)   Architectural Design Requirements for Exterior Building Elevations:
         A.   The architectural design for all buildings shall be such that the
design, materials, massing, shape, and scale of all new or modified principal
and accessory structures shall create a unified design on the premises and
shall be visually compatible with existing buildings in the vicinity.
         B.   The architectural design for all structures shall provide for
similar siding materials on all sides, rather than creating a front elevation
with high quality materials and significantly different materials on the sides
and rear, unless specifically approved upon review by the Planning Commission.
         C.   Brick, textured concrete masonry, reinforced concrete panels,
stucco, EFIS (exterior finish and insulating systems), and stone shall be
permitted as siding materials.
         D.   Sheet metal, corrugated metal, vinyl siding, aluminum siding, and
plain concrete block shall generally be deemed inappropriate, unless approved
by the Planning Commission on a case-by-case basis due to specific locational
situations and with a determination that the visual effect from adjacent
properties will not be a detriment to those properties' future use and/or
development.

trash enclosures, and similar appendages, shall be constructed of the same
materials as the principal building, unless specifically approved upon review
by the Planning Commission.

shall provide details of any flood hazard areas identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), including details of base flood elevations
and proposed or existing building floor elevations.

sanitary sewers, natural gas, electric power, telephone and broadband
communication service shall be located so as to provide convenience during
maintenance procedures and approval of the size, materials, and location shall
be obtained from the appropriate public utility agency prior to review by the
Planning Commission.
         E.   The number of driveways shall be limited as much as possible and
the location of all driveways shall be designed to reduce the incidence of
conflicting left turns, cut- through traffic, internal circulation conflicts,
and adverse impacts on adjacent properties and uses. The location of driveway
intersections with public rights-of way shall be submitted for review by the
City Engineer, whose approval shall be obtained prior to review by the Planning
Commission. The City Engineer may request the applicant to provide an
additional traffic study of an appropriate level, if needed to complete the
review of traffic circulation or traffic impacts.

fire suppression systems in the building (fire sprinklers). Approval of the
site plan and any required fire connections or fire lanes shall be obtained
from the Fire Chief or designee prior to review by the Planning Commission.
         H.   Vehicle parking areas and materials or equipment storage/handling
areas shall be not located in any required front yard or in any corner side
yard or in any transitional yard areas adjacent to a residential zoning
district; except that up to fifty (50) feet of a required transitional yard may
be occupied by a parking lot solely for employees' automobile parking, if
approved by the Planning Commission as part of the site development plan and if
the landscaping plan for the remainder of the transitional yard is designed
with dense materials so spaced to reduce visual impacts for residential
neighbors.
         I.   Paved pedestrian access paths or yard walks shall be provided to
connect to public sidewalks (if available) and to connect between building
access doors and parking areas, so as to eliminate pedestrian use of landscaped
areas or pedestrian conflict with vehicular driveways.

and protection of sites and structures within Troy city limits that have
historical, architectural, archeological, and cultural values and serve as
visible reminders of the history and heritage of this city, state, and nation.
Well-preserved historic buildings and places, attractive residential areas, and
orderly business districts add meaning and livability to a city. Hence, to
accomplish this, it is necessary to provide a method whereby, with careful
consideration for private property rights and only after a thorough analysis of
the objectives to be achieved, certain procedures and regulations are
established for changes made to significant buildings or neighborhoods.
   (b)    Purpose. It is the intent of this Section to promote and protect the
health, safety, cultural, economic, and general welfare of the public through:

state, or national history;
      (2)    The preservation and enhancement of a city of varied architectural
styles reflecting the distinct phases of the city's history;
      (3)    The preservation, restoration, or rehabilitation of historically
significant districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess
integrity of location design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and
association;

environment for the aforesaid sites and areas;

neighborhood stability;

within historic districts for economically productive uses;

vitality through private renewal and architectural creativity, within
appropriate controls and standards. It is intended to foster a climate in which
Troy's historic districts may continue to exist as living, changing commercial
and residential areas, not static environments;

   (n)    Certificate of Appropriateness - Demolition, Removal or Moving of
Structure.
      (1)    General. The demolition of a historic or contributing property, or
the moving of a structure, can have a significant impact on the character and
quality of the historic district by removing an integral part of the historic
area fabric; elimination of a part of the City of Troy's history; and generally
altering the nature of the district for the future. No person shall demolish
any structure, or move a structure in a listed property or district until a COA
of such demolition or movement has been authorized by the Planning Commission
or the Zoning Administrator and a permit is issued by the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)    No demolition, removal, or moving of structure proposal will be
accepted:
         A.    Without a mandatory pre-application meeting with Development
Staff before the item is included on a Planning Commission Agenda;
         B.    Without a detailed reuse plan; and
         C.    Without a detailed plan of preserving any remaining exterior
architectural features and/or historical features of the structure.
      (3)    The applicant shall submit a detailed reuse plan that mitigates
any adverse effects of the proposed removal upon the property, the streetscape,
and the historic district through:
         A.    New construction that is'consistent with the Guidelines.
         B.    Exterior rehabilitation or restoration of the remaining
structure that is consistent with the Guidelines.
         C.    Landscaping the parcel consistent with the Guidelines, providing
for its care as common space for the benefit of the general public, and
relocating the remaining structure in an appropriate setting or preserving of
the salvageable architectural materials.
         D.    Posting a financial guarantee in accordance with Section
1143.22(n)(3) of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Troy, Ohio with the
Zoning Administrator sufficient to ensure completion of the reuse plan, or has
requested and received a waiver of these requirements from the Planning
Commission.
         E.    If no alternatives or mitigation is possible and the
undertaking's benefits in relation to the significance of the property justify
demolition as an acceptable loss, the Planning Commission may consider other
appropriate reuse plans and or relax any of these requirements.
      (4)    Prior to acting on an application for demolition of a significant
principal structure, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing within
thirty (30) days after the submittal of a completed application.
      (5)    Owners of property contiguous to the applicant's property, and
owners of property directly across any street or alley shall be notified of the
time, date and place of the public hearing no later than five (5) days before
the public hearing.
      (6)    The Planning Commission may delay determination of the application
for a period of no more than one-hundred and twenty (120) days upon a finding
that the property is of such architectural/historical significance that
alternatives to demolition may be feasible. In the event that action upon such
application is delayed, the Planning Commission may take necessary steps as it
deems necessary to preserve the property. Such steps may include but shall not
be limited to consultation with civic groups, public agencies and interested
citizens.
      (7)    The Planning Commission shall only approve a COA for demolition if
the application meets one of two conditions: 1) the application satisfies
criterion A below; or, 2) the application satisfies criterion B and either C or
D or both.
         A.    The Planning Commission finds that the structure subject to the
application is not historically significant or non-qualifying per Section
1143.22(m)(6), the Planning Commission shall state the basis for such
determination and shall be required to make a formal determination that the
proposed demolition, removal of an architectural feature, or movement of a
structure will not harm or reduce the historical significance of the site on
which it is located or the historic district as a whole.
         B.    The cost of repairs exceeds the average of the appraised values
of the building and there is no reasonable economic viability for the property
as ii exists or as ii might be rehabilitated. Evidence of economic non-
viability shall include:
            i.    Two (2) estimates from licensed and bonded contractors
depicting the cost of proposed demolition;
            ii.    Two (2) appraised values of the property by two (2) licensed
appraisers for the following conditions:
               a.    The property's current condition;
               b.    After completion of the proposed demolition;
               c.    After the rehabilitation of the existing property for
continued use by providing sales for the previous six (6) months for at least
three comparable properties. If there are not sales for the previous six (6)
months of comparable properties, sales for the previous year of comparable
properties may be used; and
               d.    If the property is an income-producing property, the
valuation must include the rent scheduled and anticipated income after such
rehabilitation, and the same for at least three comparable properties to
substantiate the information provided for the property in question.
            iii.    Two (2) estimates from licensed and bonded architects,
developers, contractors, or appraisers experienced in historic rehabilitation
as to the cost to rehabilitate the building to the point of which a principally
permitted use or a reasonable profit can be realized from the property in
underlying zoning district, including, but not limited to, bringing a structure
up to code, so that it can be occupied, that is, not necessarily its "highest
and best use", preferred use, or a restoration project.
            iv.    The applicant has submitted evidence illustrating
significant damage or structural issues pertaining to the structure that would
present a specific infeasibility towards the use or occupation of the
structure, as it currently exists, or an economic infeasibility towards the
preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, or reconstruction of the structure.
            v.    The property owner and/or applicant has actively marketed the
property and structure for the purposes of maintenance, preservation,
restoration, or reconstruction, and not demolition. The property owner and/or
applicant has provided detailed documentation demonstrating marketing efforts
such as Requests for Proposals (RFPs) or an MLS listing.
            vi.    The property owner and/or applicant shall provide detailed
information supporting this claim, such as:
               a.    Length of time the property was marketed or for sale and
response to the marketing efforts;

Planning Commission finds a situation that may be classified as demolition by
neglect, the Planning Commission shall notify the Zoning Administrator to
proceed with the notice requirements and enforcement procedures set forth in
this code. Demolition by neglect is further defined in Section
1143.22(p) of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Troy, Ohio.
         C.    That the property proposed for demolition is inherently

time outside of the period of significance of the Historic Preservation Overlay
District.
         D.    That the property proposed for demolition contains minimal
features of architectural and/or historical significance due to any of the
following:
            i.   Significant loss of original architectural features.
            ii.    Significant loss of decorative or other architectural
features that contribute to a historic structure and historic district.
            iii.    Compounding alterations and changes to the structure that
render original architecture and historic significance lost or indeterminable.
            iv.    The structure contains no historic architectural features
(i.e. modern buildings or modem additions to a historic structure).
      (8)    If the Planning Commission approves a COA for demolition of a
principal structure, or movement of a principal structure, the applicant shall
be subject to additional bonds or sureties as established below:

Passed 9-6-22.)
   1143.23 FP FLOOD PLAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose. Certain areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation
which could result in the loss of life and property, the creation of health and
safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and government services, and the
extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection
and relief. The FP Flood Plain Overlay District is established to protect the
community's natural flood storage capacity by regulating the use and
development of flood plains, and to notify potential buyers that property is in
an area of special flood hazard.
   (b)   Boundaries. The FP Flood Plain Overlay District shall consist of the
low area adjacent to rivers, streams, and watercourses within the City of Troy
as designated on the official zoning map; and all areas of special flood hazard
established by Section
1125 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Troy. When a property may be
partially within and partially out of the apparent boundary of the FP Flood
Plain Overlay District, the Flood Plain Administrator shall interpret the
location of the boundary and determine the extent to which these regulations
shall apply, in accordance with the provisions of said Section
1125.
   (c)   Compliance with the Flood Damage Reduction Ordinance. All
construction, development, remodeling, change of use, and change of grade of
properties in the FP Flood Plain Overlay District shall comply with the
standards of Section
1125 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Troy, as currently enacted and
as may be hereafter amended.
   
   (d)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These requirements of the FP
Flood Plain Overlay District are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any
existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this Zoning
Code and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. If a
provision herein is found to be in conflict with Federal or State law, such
Federal or State law or regulations shall take precedence over these
provisions.
   (e)   Effect on Other Zoning Districts. The FP Flood Plain Overlay District
provides requirements in addition to those of underlying residential zoning
districts, non-residential zoning districts, and other zoning districts. The
regulations of the underlying zoning district and of any other overlay zoning
district shall remain in full effect, except that where provisions conflict,
the more stringent restriction shall prevail.
   (f)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of the
requirements of the FP Flood Plain Overlay District all provisions shall be
considered as minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of
the governing body. They shall not create any entitlements or be considered
permissive.
   (g)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The restrictions for the FP Flood
Plain Overlay District are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes, based
on scientific and engineering considerations. Unusual flooding or larger floods
can and will occur. The boundaries of the FP Flood Plain Overlay District shall
not be taken to imply that other lands will be free from flooding or flood
damages. These provisions shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Troy, any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that result from
reliance on the Zoning Map or this Zoning Code or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
   (h)   Duties and Responsibilities of the Zoning Administrator. No Zoning
Certificate, Occupancy Certificate, Sign Permit, or any other approval provided
for in this Zoning Code shall be issued for any project within the FP Flood
Plain Overlay District unless approval has first been obtained by the applicant
from the Flood Plain Administrator, in accordance with Section
1125 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Troy.
   1143.24 CITY ADMINISTERED COUNTY ZONING.
   When property is annexed to the city, the zoning regulations then in effect
shall remain in full force and shall be enforced by county or township
officials (unless otherwise determined by agreement) until the city shall
either officially adopt the existing zoning regulations or new regulations for
such territory.
1143.25 DOWNTOWN/RIVERFRONT OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose. The "DR-O" Downtown/Riverfront Overlay District is designed
to promote revitalization of Downtown Troy and nearby riverfront areas by
providing an optional alternative to the regulations of the various underlying
conventional Zoning Districts in this overlay district area. It is intended to
permit alteration and adaptive reuse of existing buildings, and redevelopment
of vacant lands, in accordance with a coordinated plan which can be designed
with greater flexibility, and consequently, more creative and imaginative
redevelopment of this closely built and oldest area of Troy. The DR-

   (b)   Intent. It is not the intent of this section to require an additional
review process for adaptive reuse, renovation, remodeling, or additions to
existing buildings when those proposed alterations can conform to the
underlying zoning district's conventional standards and requirements. It is the
intent of this section that the Downtown/Riverfront site plan review process be
applied only in situations where the conventional zoning requirements are
inappropriate or unduly restrictive. In many situations, those conventional
zoning restrictions will fully satisfy the objectives of the Comprehensive
Plan. Therefore, whether or not to grant DR-O site plan approval is within the
sound discretion of the Planning Commission. However, any requested departure
from the conventional zoning district standards shall require site plan review
through the DR-O process.
   (c)   Objectives. The DR-O site plan review process is intended to permit,
in carefully designed site redevelopment projects, a variety of uses that can
complement the existing neighborhood development pattern, and to permit the
flexible spacing of lots and buildings, the adaptive reuse and preservation of
existing structures, the conservation of natural features of the landscape, and
the provision of accessible and enjoyable open spaces to promote the
preservation, improvement, and revitalization of Downtown Troy.
   (d)   Effect on Other Regulations. The DR-O site plan review process shall
not supplant or waive any requirement, review, or permit process of any other
governmental regulations or the standards of the Wellfield Protection,
Floodplain, Historic Preservation, or Historic Landmark Overlay Zoning
Districts.
   (e)   Future Effect of Site Plan Approval. The landowner who applies for
this DR-O site plan review process is voluntarily agreeing to exchange the
fixed requirements and privileges of conventional zoning for the opportunity to
negotiate different requirements and privileges, subject to approval by the
Planning Commission pursuant to the procedures set forth herein. In addition to
the authority and duties expressly set forth in this Section, the Planning
Commission shall have the continuing authority to review, and to approve or
deny any further changes in buildings, grounds, easements, covenants,
restrictions, and land uses to the approved site redevelopment plan, to assure
that the development originally approved is not negatively affected by such
changes.
   (f)   Permitted Uses. In addition to the Permitted, Accessory, and Temporary
Uses allowed by a site's underlying conventional zoning district, DR-O site
plan approval may allow for other residential, office, retail, industrial,
entertainment, and similar uses which at the discretion of the Planning
Commission and/or City Council that are compatible with the site redevelopment
plan, and complementary to the uses in the existing immediate neighborhood.
   (g)   Bulk Regulations. Recognizing the long-existing mix of small and large
lots in the Downtown Troy area and notwithstanding the requirements of the
underlying conventional zoning districts, the Planning Commission and/or City
Council may approve a DR-O site redevelopment plan as follows:
      (1)   Minimum lot size and dimensions less than required by the
underlying conventional zoning district.
      (2)   Maximum building lot coverage of one-hundred (100) percent for all
areas under roof.
      (3)   Maximum lot coverage of one-hundred (100) percent, including
buildings, paved areas, and similar constructed elements.
      (4)   Maximum structure height exceeding the underlying zoning district
regulations may be allowable by the Planning Commission and/or City Council if
such height is compatible with the existing structures in the immediate
vicinity.
      (5)   No minimum front yard and no minimum corner side yard requirements,
except if such a yard is provided it shall have a minimum dimension of five (5)
feet. Cornices, doors, windows, awnings, signs, canopies, and other similar
projections shall not extend over any public right-of-way, unless separate
street use approval is obtained from City Council.
      (6)   Minimum side yard of five (5) feet, unless adequate provision,
acceptable to the Planning Commission and/or City Council, is made for future
maintenance, such as a party wall, cross easements, etc.
      (7)   No minimum rear yard, if adequate provision, acceptable to the
Planning Commission and/or City Council, is made for future maintenance (a
party wall, cross easements, etc.) a minimum space of five (5) feet shall be
provided if a wall contains doors and is adjacent to a public alley or other
public right-of-way. If such a door is used for automobiles, adequate space and
sight distances shall be provided for safe vehicle movement onto the right-of-
way.
      (8)   Requirements for transitional yards and landscape buffers between
zoning districts may be reduced by the Planning Commission and/or City Council
when the site redevelopment includes alternate protections for neighboring
residential uses of differing intensity.
   (h)   Off-Street Parking Regulations. Recognizing the differing on-street
parking conditions in various parts of Downtown Troy, site redevelopment plans
shall include an analysis of the immediate area, projection of the parking
needs of the proposed redevelopment, and a calculation of the parking impact of
the proposed uses in accordance with the standards of Chapter
1155. Notwithstanding any available exemptions in the underlying conventional
zoning district requirements, such as in the B-3 Zoning District, the Planning
Commission and/or City Council may require off-street parking to be provided
commensurate with the findings of this site-specific analysis.
   (i)   Off-Street Loading Area Regulations. Recognizing the difficulty of on-
street goods delivery in Downtown Troy, site redevelopment plans shall include
an analysis of the trucking and delivery needs of the proposed uses in a site
redevelopment plan. The Planning Commission and/or City Council may require
additional parking and/or truck loading areas in accordance with the standards
of Chapter
1153 of the Troy Codified Ordinance.
   (j)   Signage. All signage shall comply with Chapter
749 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Troy, Ohio. The Planning
Commission and/or City Council may consider more or less stringent signage
requirements based upon the development while considering requirements from
other sections of the Codified Ordinances of Troy, Ohio.
   (k)   Landscaping Regulations.
      (1)   All open areas not occupied by buildings, storage, parking, access
driveways or loading areas shall be suitably graded, drained, seeded or sodded,
and maintained as a grass lawn (unless landscaped with trees, shrubbery, and
garden plants).
      (2)   All required transitional yards shall be landscaped with
appropriate buffer materials to provide visual separation from adjacent
residential areas. These may include, but are not limited to topographical
features, earthen berms, evergreen trees, shrubbery, fencing, stormwater
detention/retention basins, or combinations thereof, to be submitted to and
reviewed for approval by the Planning Commission and/or City Council as part of
the development plan.
      (3)   Off-street parking and loading areas shall be constructed and
landscaped in accordance with Chapters
1153 and
1155 of this Zoning Code.
      (4)   All other lawn areas shall be landscaped with a sufficient number
of suitable trees and shrubs so as to provide an attractive setting for the
building(s).
      (5)   Landscaping elements shall be maintained in appropriate condition
for their type and shall be replaced when they die or if their growth is
stunted so as to not effectively perform their screening and/or ornamental
functions.
   (l)   Open Space Preservation and Development. One of the purposes of these
regulations is to encourage the preservation of natural watercourses and wooded
areas, and the attractive development of lawn areas for human enjoyment. With
creative planning, often involving the clustering of buildings, these purposes
can be very compatible with the developer's desire to achieve an unusually
attractive and functional project at a reasonable cost. The City seeks to be a
creative partner in achieving these mutual goals.
   (m)    Pedestrian, Bicycle Circulation. A well designed pedestrian and
bicycle circulation system is essential and should be separated as completely
and as reasonably as possible from the vehicular street system in order to
provide pedestrian and bicycle safety and freedom of vehicular movement. This
system shall be designed to serve the pedestrian and bicycle needs of
surrounding neighborhoods as well as the development.
   (n)   Underground Utilities Required. Unless otherwise deemed by the
Planning Commission and/or City Council, each development that is primarily
non-manufacturing in character shall provide for uniform underground
installation of utilities, including, for example, electricity, telephone, and
cable television. In developments that are primarily manufacturing in
character, utilities shall be installed as approved by the City. Utility
installation and maintenance of facilities shall be in accordance with the
requirements and regulations of the City and of the utility authority having
the right of installation and maintenance. A development shall not be approved
unless adequate assurance is given that adequate public or central water and
sanitary sewers will be available at the first occupancy.
   (o)   Erosion and Sedimentation Control. Unless otherwise approved by the
Planning Commission and/or City Council, all developments shall also comply
with the regulations contained in Chapter
1125 and sedimentation controls shall be planned and applied according to the
following principles:
      (1)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one
time during development.
      (2)   When land is exposed during development, the exposure should be
kept to the shortest practical period of time.
      (3)   Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
critical areas exposed during development.
      (4)   Sediment basins (debris basins or silt traps) shall be installed
and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing
development.
      (5)   Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused
by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
      (6)   Permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed as
soon as practical in the development.
      (7)   The development shall be fitted to the topography and soils so as
to create the least erosion potential.
      (8)   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected. Developments must conform to Chapter
741 of the Codified Ordinances of Troy, Ohio.
   (p)   Plan Review Procedures. 
      (1)   Site Plan Review Required.
         A.   To obtain information regarding the DR-O approval process,
requirements, and other information relative to a zoning application, each
applicant is highly encouraged to engage in informal consultations with City
staff prior to filing an application. The applicant should be prepared to
discuss the general concept of the development, with a conceptual plan.
Thereafter, City staff should furnish the applicant with written comments
regarding such conference, including appropriate recommendations to inform and
assist the applicant prior to his or her preparation of the components of the
DR-O zoning application. It is not required that a person requesting a pre-

the subject property. No statement or representation by a member of the staff
shall be binding upon the Planning Commission and/or City Council.
         B.   No Zoning Certificate or Occupancy Certificate shall be issued
for construction, alteration, enlargement, or change of use of any building or
structure utilizing the standards and alternate requirements of the Downtown/
Riverfront Overlay District until the approval of the Planning Commission as
set forth herein is obtained for the specific site redevelopment and/or use
plan. The Planning Commission and/or City Council review shall not be required
for a change in the operator of the business or a change of owner or occupant,
provided the change does not include a change in use of any parts of the
grounds and/or building.

Council may request from the applicant any additional information (such as
parking and traffic impact studies) it determines necessary to approve a plan.
If a plan is not approved within ninety (90) days after its submittal, it shall
be deemed denied, unless an extension is approved by the Planning Commission
and/or City Council.
         E.   Any requested modification of an approved site redevelopment plan
including the declaration of restrictions and covenants shall be submitted to
the Planning Commission and/or City Council for review and its approval shall

         F.   Either a zoning certificate holder or the Zoning Administrator
may request the Planning Commission and/or City Council review of the Zoning
Administrator's interpretation of the requirements of an approved site
redevelopment plan.
      (2)   Architectural Design Requirements for Exterior Building Elevations:
         A.   The architectural design for all buildings shall be such that the
design, materials, massing, shape, and scale of all new or modified principal
and accessory structures shall create a unified design on the premises and
shall be visually compatible with existing buildings in the vicinity.
         B.   The architectural design for all structures shall provide for
similar siding materials on all sides, rather than creating a front elevation

shall provide details of any flood hazard areas identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), including details of base flood elevations
and proposed or existing building floor elevations.
         D.   Public utility connections including but not limited to water,
sanitary sewers, natural gas, electric power, telephone and broadband
communication service shall be located so as to provide convenience during
maintenance procedures and approval of the size, materials, and location shall
be obtained from the appropriate public utility agency prior to review by the
Planning Commission and/or City Council.
         E.   The number of driveways shall be limited as much as possible and
the location of all driveways shall be designed to reduce the incidence of
conflicting left turns, cut- through traffic, internal circulation conflicts,
and adverse impacts on adjacent properties and uses. The location of driveway
intersections with public rights-of way shall be submitted for review by the
City Engineer, whose approval shall be obtained prior to review by the Planning
Commission and/or City Council. The City Engineer may request the applicant to
provide an additional traffic study of an appropriate level, if needed to
complete the review of traffic circulation or traffic impacts.
         F.   Truck docks and truck maneuvering areas shall not be located on
the building sides that face adjacent residential zoning districts.
         G.   Approval of the proposed site redevelopment plan and any required
fire connections or fire lanes shall be obtained from the Fire Chief or
designee prior to review by the Planning Commission and/or City Council.
         H.   Paved pedestrian access paths or yard walks shall be provided to
connect to public sidewalks (if available) and to connect between building
access doors and parking areas, so as to eliminate pedestrian use of landscaped
areas or pedestrian conflict with vehicular driveways.
         I.   No unenclosed outdoor storage shall be permitted.
         J.   The City Engineer and/or the Planning Commission and/or City
Council may require that off-site improvements be provided by the applicant,
depending on the scope of the development.
      (4)   The Planning Commission and/or City Council shall not be required
to hear any application which substantively covers a matter on which it has
ruled within the preceding six (6) months.
   (q)   Plan Review Process.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall first review each application for
compliance with all requirements of this Zoning Code and other pertinent
sections of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Troy, Ohio. If the
application is found to be in compliance with the underlying zoning district
the permit shall be issued. If the Zoning Administrator finds the application
does not comply with the requirements of the underlying zoning district, the
Zoning Administrator shall deny the application. An application for development
within the DR-O may be submitted within twenty days after the denial letter is
issued by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall refer the
DR-O application and all related materials to the Planning Commission at the
next scheduled meeting for review pursuant to this Section.
         a.   The Planning Commission may review but shall not take action at
the first meeting the DR-O application appears on an agenda of the Planning
Commission. After the DR-O application has been received, the Planning
Commission secretary will provide written notice at a minimum of five (5)
business days before the second scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission to
owners of property abutting the applicant's property and owners of property
directly across any street or alley, as they appear on the application. Any
party in interest may appear and be heard at the hearing in person or by agent.
The proposed development together with such maps which are a part of or
referred to in the text of the proposed development, together with the report
of the Planning Commission shall be on file with the secretary of the Planning
Commission.
         b.   After the proposed development has been introduced to the
Planning Commission and the notices have been mailed out by the secretary of
the Planning Commission, the Planning Commission may take the following action
at the next scheduled meeting upon review of the application: approve, modify
or disapprove those items listed as modifications.
         c.   The Planning Commission shall review all applications and shall
grant, modify, or deny and/or recommend the granting, the denial, or
modifications of such applications based upon the following criteria:
            1.   To prevent hazards to the health and safety of the public an
of all occupants of improved real property.
            2.   To assure adequate light, air and convenience of access for
all properties.
            3.   To promote the delivery of public services such as utilities,
streets, refuse collection, emergency medical services, fire and police
protection.
            4.   To provide for creatively designed single-use and mixed-use
Planned Developments, and to preserve their character and vitality through
ongoing regulatory supervision.
            5.   To assure, through an appropriate site plan review that the
general, district and supplementary regulations of this Zoning Code are being
followed in the design of each new site improvement or redevelopment.
            6.   To minimize adverse effects on traffic safety caused by
development and certain land uses.
            7.   To minimize adverse effects on the environment resulting from
development and certain land uses.
            8.   To facilitate the efficient and economical development and use
of land and public facilities.
            9.   To allocate to each site development, rather than to the
public, the maximum feasible portion of the infrastructure and operating costs
which arise as a result of that development.
            10.   To fairly balance the interest of property owners and
occupants in continuing their nonconforming land uses against the community
interest in achieving full compliance with this Zoning Code.
            11.   To protect floodways and flood plains from development which
increases the general risk of flooding or puts occupants of the development at
risk.
            12.   To preserve and enhance property values.
            13.   To protect public and private water supplies, both in quality
and quantity.
            14.   To promote the economic vitality of business and industry.
            15.   To direct particular land uses to the parcels of land best
suited for them physically and in terms of access to highways and public
services.
            16.   To enhance the predictability and profitability of private
investments made in the City.
            17.   To continuously improve the aesthetic character of all parts
of the City.
         d.   For all other applications, the Planning Commission shall make a
formal recommendation to the City Council after a mandatory public hearing,
regarding the application by filing the recommendation with the Clerk of
Council. The Clerk of Council shall immediately forward the recommendation to
the President of Council and City Council. In the event that the City Council
takes no action within five business days of the filing of the Planning
Commission's recommendation, the recommendation of the Planning Commission
shall be adopted and become final. In the event City Council acts upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission, City Council shall act on the
recommendation in accordance with Ohio Revised Code Section 713.12 and Chapter
1139 of this Zoning Code.

   1145.01 INTENT AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   It is the intent of this Section to accommodate creative and
imaginative Planned Developments (hereinafter referred to as PDs) and to permit
those innovations in the technology of land development that are in the best
interest of the City. In order to accomplish this intent, it is the purpose of
a PD District to permit, in a carefully designed development, a variety of uses
and/or dwelling types, and to permit the flexible spacing of lots and
buildings, the conservation of natural features of the landscape, the provision
of accessible and enjoyable open spaces, and the provision of a necessary or
desirable complement of community and neighborhood facilities.
   (b)   In addition to the authority and duties expressly set forth in this
Section, the City shall have the continuing authority to review, and to approve
or deny changes in buildings, grounds, easements, covenants, restrictions, and
land uses within the PD, to assure that the development originally approved is
not negatively affected by such changes.
   (c)   It is the further intent of this Zoning Code that Planned Development
zoning be applied only in situations where conventional zoning is inappropriate
or unduly restrictive. In many situations, conventional zoning will fully
satisfy the objectives of the City's Comprehensive Plan. Therefore, whether or
not to grant PD zoning is within the sound discretion of the Planning
Commission and City Council.
   (d)   The landowner who applies for PD zoning is voluntarily agreeing to
exchange the fixed requirements and privileges of conventional zoning for the
opportunity to negotiate different requirements and privileges, subject to
approval by the City Council.
   (e)   All uses within Planned Development zoning districts are subject to
further regulation under Sections
1147 through 1161 of this Zoning Code and as otherwise provided by law, except
where different standards are both: (1) approved by the City within the PD
approval process; and (2) documented on the final development plan.
   1145.02 PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   Planned Developments in any residential district may contain, in
addition to those uses that normally would be permitted in the district for
which the development is proposed, the following:
      (1)   Business and personal service uses as permitted in the "B-1" Local
Retail District to the extent that they are designed and intended to serve the
residents of the Planned Development.
      (2)   A mixture of types of buildings and structures, such as detached,
semi-detached, attached, multi-storied, or any combination thereof.
   (b)   Planned Developments in the Office-Residential, Office-Commercial or
Business Districts may contain a mixture of uses and types of buildings and
structures.
   (c)   Planned Developments in Industrial Districts may contain only those
uses that would be permitted in the district for which the development is
proposed. The application shall contain an engineering study demonstrating that
the proposed industrial uses will comply with the applicable standards imposed
by the particular industrial district in which it is proposed to locate the
Planned Development.
   1145.03 AREA, DENSITY AND LOT REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Minimum Area for Development. A Planned Development shall contain a
minimum of one (1) acre. All land within the development shall be contiguous in
that it shall not be divided into segments by a limited access highway or by a
tract of land, other than streets or rights-of-way for public or private
utility transmission lines, not owned by the landowner of the PD.
   (b)   Density of Development. A PD should not exceed the gross density
permitted in the conventional zoning district most similar in nature and
function to the pertinent portion of the PD, with the following exceptions:
      (1)   All densities are to be determined on the basis of gross dwelling
units per acre, excluding such acreage as is used for nonresidential purposes.
      (2)   Densities may be increased in the net project area where the
factors listed herein make a substantial improvement in the PD:
         A.   Landscaping, streetscape, open spaces and plazas, use of existing
landscape, pedestrian way treatment, and residential areas;
         B.   Setting, visual focus points, use of existing physical features
such as topography, view of sun and wind orientation, circulation pattern,
physical environment, variation in building setbacks, and building groups (such
as clustering);
         C.   Design features, street sections, architectural styles,
harmonious use of materials, parking areas broken by landscape features, and
varied use of building types;
         D.   Common open space exceeding the district requirements; or
         E.   Availability of contiguous publicly-owned open space, off-street
parking, storm water retention basins and other facilities that reduce the need
for such facilities within the PD.
   (c)   Minimum Requirements.
      (1)   Dwelling unit size, yard setback, type of dwelling unit, frontage
and use restrictions, as established by conventional zoning may be waived for
PDs, provided that the intent and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan are
complied with in the total development plan. Building separation shall be
maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Fire Prevention Code and
other safety codes of the City and in accordance with good design principles.
      (2)   Every dwelling unit shall have continuous paved pedestrian access
to adequate vehicle parking facilities conveniently located nearby.
   (d)   Perimeter Requirements. If topographical or other barriers within the
development do not provide reasonable privacy for existing uses adjacent to the
development, the City shall impose either of the following requirements, or may
impose both if required by unique circumstances:
      (1)   Structures located on the perimeter of the development should be
set back in accordance with the provisions of the conventional zoning district
most similar in nature and function to the portion of the PD in which the
structure within the development is situated.
      (2)   Structures located on the perimeter of the development must be well
screened in a manner approved by the City. Screening shall be according to
Section
1149.11 of this Zoning Code but may be more or less stringent at the sole
discretion of the City if in the best interests of adjacent property owners.
   1145.04 INTERIOR STREETS.
   Interior streets shall be constructed according to City structural
specifications, as delineated in the Subdivision Regulations, and properly
lighted and maintained to conform to City ordinances. Their minimum paved
roadway widths should ordinarily be as delineated in the Subdivision
Regulations and in the Thoroughfare Plan. However, approval of interior access
streets with different nonstructural dimensions will be considered by the City
where the developer can demonstrate substantial compliance with the Subdivision
Regulations and Thoroughfare Plan and receive approval from the City Engineer.
Approval of the PD with such differences will constitute lawful approval of a
waiver of the Subdivision Regulations and Thoroughfare Plan. Where streets are
constructed pursuant to such a waiver, such streets shall be privately owned
and maintained, and shall be constructed entirely within a public access
easement. All public access easements shall be designated on the preliminary
plan and the final development plan.
   1145.05  COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS.
   On the final plan, and in the PD's declaration of restrictions and
covenants, if one is filed, the following covenants shall appear which
establish the rights and responsibilities of the property owner and the City
with regard to public access easements, waterways and common areas:
   (a)   To ensure the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the
city, private drives constructed within designated public access easements
shall be open and accessible to fire, police and other emergency and
maintenance vehicles at all times. Streets, curbs, gutters, tree lawns and
other improvements within these easements shall be continuously maintained by
the owner in good repair and kept free from all obstructions that would impede
the free movement of public traffic, including but not limited to ice, snow and
parked vehicles. Where necessary, in accordance with a traffic control plan
approved by the City Engineer, traffic control devices shall be provided,
installed and maintained by the owner. To ensure compliance with traffic
control devices in public access easements, the City shall have full power and
authority to enforce such controls and to prosecute violators in accord with
municipal and state law.
   (b)   No public access easement shall be blocked for any purpose without
prior approval of the City.
   (c)   In the event that the owner of a public access easement fails to
fulfill the obligations set forth in these covenants, conditions and
restrictions, the City is hereby authorized, after providing reasonable notice
and opportunity for hearing to the owner of the fee interest in the easement
area, to take such corrective action as it deems necessary, to charge the fee
owner for the entire cost thereof, and in the event of failure of prompt
payment, to collect said costs as a special assessment against the property.
   (d)   The City shall have the permanent and irrevocable right and authority
to inspect such interior streets, access easements, waterways, common spaces
and improvements thereon as are developed in the PD.
   (e)   The City of Troy shall have the right, but not the responsibility, to
enter upon any Lot in the subdivision to inspect and monitor any storm water
detention basin areas or drainage facilities constructed in the subdivision. In
the event that the facilities are not properly constructed or maintained, upon
the failure of the Developer or the Association to take corrective action after
being duly notified in writing by the City, the City shall have the right, but
not the obligation to take whatever action is necessary to correct any improper
construction or to maintain storm water detention basin areas and drainage
facilities; provided, however, that the Developer and/or the Association shall
first have a reasonable period of time, taking into account the urgency of the
matter, to take corrective action. Any cost incurred by the City of Troy for
such maintenance may be assessed to the Association or, if the Association has
ceased to exist, against individual lots in accordance with the Declaration.
Storm water drainage restrictions shall run with the land, and shall bind the
owners, successors, and assigns unless and until a modification is agreed to
and approved by the Council of the City of Troy.
   (f)   The PD or its Declaration of Restrictions and Covenants that affects
the rights and authorities of the City, or maintenance or preservation of
common areas, waterways, interior streets, and/or access easements, shall not
be amended by the Developer without the City's prior express written consent.
   1145.06  COLLECTOR STREETS AND MAJOR THOROUGHFARES.
   Collector streets and major thoroughfares shall be designated as such by the
developer upon the submission of the preliminary plan. Such designations may be
subject to modification by the City so that an efficient circulation system is
established in relation to other existing or planned streets in the area. There
shall be no direct access from single-family residential lots to a major
thoroughfare, and direct access from single-family residential lots to
collector streets should be minimized.
   1145.07  OFF-STREET PARKING.
   There shall be provided outside the public or private right-of-way the
minimum number of parking spaces required in Section
1155 of this Zoning Code. Where appropriate, common driveways, parking areas,
walks and steps shall be provided, maintained and lighted for night use.
Screening of parking or service areas may be required through ample use of
trees, shrubs, hedges and screening devices. All parking spaces and service
drives shall be improved with bituminous, concrete or equivalent surfacing and
so graded and drained to properly collect all surface water accumulation within
the area. All paved parking areas in PD districts shall be curbed to City
street specifications.
   1145.08  COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   Amount and Character. In support of Section
1145.01 above, it is the intent of this section to encourage aesthetically
pleasing open space features with both functionality and which adds unique
character to a planned development. To that end, a minimum of ten (10) percent
of the total acreage in a proposed development permitted by this Section should
be dedicated to public and/or private open space or recreation facilities
available to all occupants of the PD. Such open space shall be shown on all
required plans and should be physically situated so as to be readily
accessible, available to and usable by all residents of the PD. Water retention
and detention areas may be included in calculating the open space requirements
at the sole discretion of the City, provided those areas serve as more than
just the basic storm water management needs of the development. The City may
reduce the minimum common open space requirement, or waive it for good cause.
However, PDs with a residential component shall be less likely to see a waiver
of this requirement than PDs without a residential component.
   (b)   Conveyance and Maintenance. All common open space, shown on the final
development plan and recorded in the office of the Recorder of Miami County,
must be conveyed by leasing or conveying title, including beneficial ownership,
to a corporation, homeowner's association or other legal entity. The terms of
such lease or other instrument of conveyance must include provisions
satisfactory to the City for guaranteeing:
      1.   The continued use of such land for its specified purposes;
      2.   Continuity of proper maintenance;
      3.   Availability of funds required for such maintenance;
      4.   Adequate insurance protection; and
      5.   Recovery for loss sustained by casualty, condemnation or otherwise.
   The developer shall provide to the City at the time the final plan is filed
for City review and approval, executed legal documents which create the
aforesaid guarantees and, in particular, which will restrict the use of common
open space to the specified purposes.
   1145.09  OPEN SPACE PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT.
   One of the principal purposes of these PD regulations is to encourage the
preservation of natural watercourses and wooded areas, and the attractive
development of lawn areas for human enjoyment. With creative planning, often
involving the clustering of buildings, these purposes can be very compatible
with the developer's desire to achieve an unusually attractive and functional
project at a reasonable cost. The City seeks to be a creative partner in
achieving these mutual goals.
   1145.10 PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE CIRCULATION.
   A well designed pedestrian and bicycle circulation system is essential and
should be separated as completely and as reasonably as possible from the
vehicular street system in order to provide pedestrian and bicycle safety and
freedom of vehicular movement. This system shall be designed to serve the
pedestrian and bicycle needs of surrounding neighborhoods as well as the PD.
   1145.11 UNDERGROUND UTILITIES REQUIRED.
   Each PD that is primarily non-manufacturing in character shall provide for
uniform underground installation of utilities, including, for example,
electricity, telephone, and cable television. In PDs that are primarily
manufacturing in character, utilities shall be installed as approved by the
City. Utility installation and maintenance of facilities shall be in accordance
with the requirements and regulations of the City and of the utility authority
having the right of installation and maintenance. A PD shall not be approved
unless adequate assurance is given that adequate public or central water and
sanitary sewers will be available at the first occupancy.
   1145.12 EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
    In addition to the regulations outlined in this Section, all developments
shall also comply with the regulations contained in Section
1125.
   Effective erosion and sedimentation controls shall be planned and applied
according to the following principles:
   (a)   The smallest practical area of land should be exposed at any one time
during development.
   (b)   When land is exposed during development, the exposure should be kept
to the shortest practical period of time.
   (c)   Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect critical
areas exposed during development.
   (d)   Sediment basins (debris basins or silt traps) shall be installed and
maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing
development.
   (e)   Provisions shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by
changed soil and surface conditions during and after development.
   (f)   Permanent final vegetation and structures shall be installed as soon
as practical in the development.
   (g)   The development shall be fitted to the topography and soils so as to
create the least erosion potential.
   (h)   Wherever feasible, natural vegetation should be retained and
protected. Development of the PD must conform to the City Tree Ordinance
(Section
741) that may be in effect at the time the general plan is submitted.
   1145.13 ESTABLISHMENT OF PD.
   Application for a PD shall be processed through three (3) mandatory steps:
   (a)   Step 1: Approval of the General Plan. Application for a zoning change
to PD shall include a general plan conforming to the requirements of Section
1145.15(d) of this Zoning Code. Approval procedures for Step 1 of the PD
process are set forth in Section
1145.16 of this Zoning code. Approval requires action by both the Planning
Commission and City Council.
   (b)   Step 2: Final Development Plan. A final development plan shall be
prepared in conformance with the approved general plan and in accordance with
the requirements of Section
1145.18 of this Zoning Code. Approval procedures for Step 2 of the PD process
are set forth in Section
1145.19 of this Zoning Code. Approval requires action by the Planning
Commission.
   (c)   Step 3: Record Plan. A record plan shall be developed in accordance
with the approved final development plan and in accordance with the
requirements set forth in Section
1145.20 of this Zoning Code. Approval requires action by both the Planning
Commission and City Council.
   1145.14 PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE RECOMMENDED.
   To obtain information regarding the PD approval process, requirements, and
other information relative to the PD application, each applicant is highly
encouraged to engage in informal consultations with City staff prior to filing
an application. The applicant should be prepared to discuss the general concept
of the PD, with a conceptual plan. Thereafter, City staff should furnish the
applicant with written comments regarding such conference, including
appropriate recommendations to inform and assist the applicant prior to his or
her preparation of the components of the PD zoning application. It is not
required that a person requesting a pre-application conference be a legal owner
or holder of an equitable interest in the subject property. No statement or
representation by a member of the staff shall be binding upon the Planning
Commission or City Council.
   1145.15 GENERAL PLAN SUBMITTAL.
   (a)   Application for PD zoning shall be made by the property owner or his
or her authorized agent in the same manner as a request for any other zoning
district designation. PD zoning cannot be initiated by the City without the
written permission of the property owner.
   (b)   The General Plan, which shall be set forth in one or more maps or
instruments, shall be signed by all owners of property within the project,

   1145.16 GENERAL PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   The Planning Commission shall review the proposed General Plan and may
recommend the General Plan to City Council if it determines that the plan
satisfies, at a minimum, all of the following criteria:
      (1)   The General Plan should follow to the maximum extent practicable
the Comprehensive Plan for the City, taking into account current facts and
circumstances;
      (2)   An exemption to conventional zoning is justified because the
Comprehensive Plan for the City can be more faithfully and reliably implemented
by the use of PD zoning;
      (3)   The General Plan is compatible with the location, topographic and
other characteristics of the site and will bear a beneficial relationship with
surrounding land uses in terms of noise, smoke, dust, debris, or other
nuisances;
      (4)   The General Plan is carefully designed to support surrounding
streets, utilities and other public improvements;
      (5)   The General Plan represents an efficient and economic use of the
land in view of the community's need for a balance of land uses;
      (6)   All public streets, utilities and services necessary to carry out
the General Plan are available to the site, or will be extended or improved by
the developer and/or City in time to permit the development to be properly
served;
      (7)   Exception from conventional zoning is warranted by design goals or
other criteria and/or the need to provide a variety of development
opportunities within the community;
      (8)   The design of the development protects natural assets such as
streams, wood lots, steep terrain, and other critical environments in the City;
      (9)   Taken as a whole the development of the proposed PD will have a
positive effect on the health, safety, and general welfare of the City;
      (10)   The General Plan appears capable of being implemented by a Final
Development Plan which meets all requirements of this Section.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall make a formal recommendation to the City
Council regarding the proposed General Plan. After receipt of the
recommendation, City Council shall act on the recommendation in accordance with
Ohio R.C. 713.12 and Section
1139 of this Zoning Code.
   1145.17 REVISION OF APPROVED GENERAL PLAN.
   The final development plan shall substantially conform to the approved
general plan. In the preparation of the final development plan, the applicant
shall not materially deviate from the approved general plan or to the related
documents. Major changes to the general plan may not be made unless and until a
revised general plan is processed and approved in accordance with this Section.
Minor changes may be approved by the Planning Commission without submission of
the revised general plan to City Council.
   1145.18 PD APPLICATION STEP 2: FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   Before any part of a PD subdivision may be reflected in a Record Plan and
recorded, the improvements and uses previously described in an approved General
Plan must be merged and detailed in a Final Development Plan. No Final
Development Plan shall be considered or approved without formal approval by
City Council of the General Plan. Once these approvals have been received, the
owner may seek approval for a Final Development Plan for the overall PD or for
a phase or phases of the PD. The Final Development Plan shall show all of those
items required in the General Plan as well as any additional information
requested by the Planning Commission or City Council.
   1145.19  FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   The Planning Commission shall review each final development plan and
approve, modify and approve, or disapprove the plan and transmit notice thereof
to the applicant within a reasonable time. The Commission shall give the final
approval of uses only upon finding that the following requirements are met:
      (1)   No requirement of this Section, as existing at the time of General
Plan approval, is violated by the Final Development Plan.
      (2)   The Final Development Plan is substantially in accordance with the
General Plan that had been previously filed with and approved by the Commission
and City Council.
      (3)   The area reserved for open space and recreation satisfies the
provisions of Sections
1145.07 and
1145.08 of this Zoning Code.
      (4)   Satisfactory progress has been made under any previously approved
Final Development Plan with respect to the provision and improvement of
indicated open space and recreational facilities.
      (5)   All areas designated for public acceptance are conceptually
satisfactory to the City, including public access easements.
   (b)   Upon approval of the final development plan by the Commission, the
Commission shall:
      (1)   Furnish the developer with written notice of approval; and
      (2)   See to it that the Final Development Plan is recorded. The recorded
Final Development Plan shall incorporate the approved General Plan by
reference. Approval of a Final Development Plan does not obligate the City
Council to approve the Record Plan. Planning Commission approval of a Final
Development Plan is a necessary pre-condition to consideration and approval of
a Record Plan.
   1145.20 PD APPLICATION STEP 3: RECORD PLAN.
   (a)   Within six (6) months of approval of the Final Development Plan for
any specific area within the project or for the overall project, a Record Plan
for the area shown on the Final Development Plan shall be submitted in
accordance with Section
1115 of the Subdivision Regulations.
   (b)   Documents. At the time record plans are filed with the Planning
Commission, the developer shall also file:
      (1)   Cost estimates for all public improvements in the subdivision plan;
and
      (2)   Other documents and assurances required by the Subdivision
Regulations.
   (c)   Final Approval by Planning Commission.  Within sixty (60) days after
the Record Plan is filed, with all necessary documents and exhibits, the
Commission shall approve, approve and modify or disapprove the Record Plan and
forward its recommendation to City Council.
   (d)   Final Approval by Council.  Within ninety (90) days after approval by
the Commission of the Record Plan, Council shall approve, modify and approve,
or disapprove it.
   (e)   Recording. Upon Council approval of the Record Plan, the City shall
notify the applicant. The developer shall file the Record Plan in the office of
the Miami County Recorder. A reproducible copy of the recorded final plat shall
be furnished to the City Engineer no later than fifteen (15) days from date of
recording. The developer shall record the approved final development plan
simultaneously with the record plan.
   1145.21 FAILURE TO BEGIN OR CONTINUE PLANNED DEVELOPMENT.
   The construction of a subdivision under PD zoning is authorized by a
subdivider's agreement between the City and the land owner. This agreement,
regardless of its form, is a contract intended to assure the orderly
construction of a complete, well planned development. Should the land owner
breach this contract by abandoning construction or failing to proceed with the
development at the pace agreed upon, the City may be entitled to implement
certain remedies as follows:
   (a)   If a complete record plan approval application is not submitted within
six (6) months of the approval of a Final Development Plan, the Final
Development Plan shall be null and void. The Commission, for good cause, may
extend for consecutive periods of six (6) months or less the time for
submitting the record plan application.
   (b)   If no construction has begun in the PD within six (6) months after the
recording of a Record Plan for the overall project or any part thereof, the
Record Plan may be vacated by resolution of the City Council and be of no
further effect. The Commission, for good cause and in its sole discretion, may
extend for periods of up to six (6) months the time for beginning construction.
   (c)   Should a land owner who has been authorized to develop a PD under this
Section, or under any previous PD or PUD regulations of the City, sell or
otherwise convey ownership of any part of that PD to another before all planned
public improvements such as streets, curb cuts, and utilities are constructed
therein in accord with plans and specifications approved by the City, and/or
before all lands required for the public use therein have been dedicated to the
City, that land owner may be deemed to have abandoned that portion of the PD
and to have breached all agreements with the City to the extent that they
relate to development of the portion sold. In consideration of whether a PD or
portion thereof has been abandoned or breached, the City may, pursuant to a
recommendation by the Planning Commission and approval by the City Council,
pursue any of the following remedies or any others available to it under the
law:
      (1)   In a situation where the new owner wishes to continue the
development of a subdivision, require the new owner to execute a sub divider's
contract, performance bond and all other documents and assurances required by
the City under the current regulations to guarantee those dedications and
public improvements which were not completed by the former owner.
      (2)   Enforce the sub divider's contract executed by the former owner, if
such contract exists.
      (3)   Withdraw its approval of all plans for that portion of the PD and
require any subsequent owner desiring to develop the site to begin with
submission of a proposed new General Plan under the current regulations. This
remedy may be particularly appropriate when the new land owner intends to be a
sub divider of the conveyed property.
   (d)   In the event that the new owner and the City agree to implement the
first alternative, the new owner may proceed in accord with the approved Final
Development Plan, under the provisions of this Section. If for any reason the
subdivision has not received approval of a General Plan, Final Development Plan
and Record Plan, the new owner shall enter the review process set forth in this
Section to obtain any approval not obtained by the previous owner. Thereafter,
the new owner shall not deviate from the approved plans except through the
revision procedures of Section
1145.17 of this Zoning Code, or by requesting and receiving a change of zoning
classification.
   (e)   If an approved Record Plan is vacated as provided herein, notice of
such vacation shall be filed in the records of the Miami County Recorder by the
Commission, and no development may proceed on any part of the included lands
until such time as a new Final Development Plan and Record Plan have been
submitted and approved.
   1145.22  REVISION OF APPROVED FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   The Record Plan shall conform to the approved final development plan. The
applicant and his or her successors and assigns shall make no alterations,
addition or deletions to the approved final development plan or to the related
documents. Major changes may not be made unless and until a revised final
development plan is processed and approved in accordance with this Section. If
a major change materially alters any feature of the project for which a
submittal was required for general plan approval, revision of the general plan
and review by the City Council shall be required. Minor changes may be approved
by the Planning Commission without submission of a revised final development
plan.
   1145.23  ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY FOR FAILURE TO CONFORM TO FINAL DEVELOPMENT
PLAN.
   Whenever the Planning Commission finds, in the case of an approved final
development plan, that any term, condition or restriction incorporated into the
plan is not being complied with or performed, the Planning Commission may
rescind and revoke such approval. Notice of intent to revoke shall be served
upon the owner(s) by certified mail, return receipt requested and by regular
first-class mail, giving opportunity for a hearing before the Planning
Commission. Following opportunity for a hearing, revocation may be certified by
the Chairman of the Planning Commission upon authorization by a majority of the
Commission's membership. Notice of certification of such revocation shall be
promptly recorded in the land records of Miami County. This administrative
remedy is in addition to all other remedies and penalties for violation of this
Zoning Code that are provided for herein or otherwise as a matter of law.
CHAPTER 1147
Non-Conforming Uses
1147.01   Purpose.
1147.02   Nonconforming vacant lots in agricultural and residential zoning
districts.
1147.03   Nonconforming vacant lots in other districts.
1147.04   Nonconforming buildings used for a permitted use.
1147.05   Nonconforming use of buildings, structures, and land.
   1147.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   Recognition of Nonconformities. The districts established by this
Zoning Code constitute the proper location for the specific enumerated uses,
buildings, and other structures permitted therein. Within such districts,
however, there exist nonconformities that were lawful prior to the most current
update of the Zoning Code, but that would be prohibited under the terms of this
Zoning Code. Future amendments to this Zoning Code may be expected to create
additional nonconformities.
   (b)   Continuance of Nonconformities. The legitimate interests of those who
lawfully established these nonconformities are recognized in this Zoning Code
by permitting such nonconformities to continue, subject to regulations for and
limitations upon their completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and
substitution. It is recognized, however, that nonconformities substantially and
adversely affect the orderly development, maintenance, use, and taxable value
of other property in the district, property that is itself subject to the
regulations of this Zoning Code. In order to secure eventual compliance with
the standards of this Zoning Code, it is therefore necessary to regulate
nonconformities strictly and to prevent the re-establishment of nonconformities
that have been discontinued.
   (c)   Classes of Nonconformities. Accordingly, the following sections divide
nonconformities into three (3) classes and provide appropriate regulations for
each class. These classes are:
      (1)   Vacant lots smaller than the minimum required by the Zoning Code;
      (2)   Buildings that comply with the use regulations of this Zoning Code
but not with lot size or building bulk limitations; and
      (3)   Buildings and use which do not comply with the use regulations of
Section
 1147.05 of this Zoning Code.
   1147.02  NONCONFORMING VACANT LOTS IN AGRICULTURAL AND RESIDENTIAL ZONING
DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Minimum Lot Area for Dwellings. Notwithstanding the limitations
imposed by other provisions of this Zoning Code, on a nonconforming lot which
complies with Section
1147.02(a)(2) of this Zoning Code, the following may be erected:
      (1)   In the "A", "A-R", "R-1", "R-2", "R-3", "R-3-B", "R-4", and "R-5"
Districts: One (1) single-family dwelling.
      (2)   In the "R-6" and "R-7" Districts:
         A.   On a lot with three thousand (3,000) square feet or less of area:
One (1) single-family dwelling.
         B.   On a lot with more than three thousand (3,000) square feet of
area but less than six thousand (6,000) square feet of area: One (1) single-
family dwelling or one (1) two-family dwelling.
   (b)   Nonconforming Lot. A nonconforming lot is a lot consisting entirely of
a tract of land that has less than the prescribed minimum lot area, width,
depth, or combination thereof.
   (c)   Minimum Side Yards for Dwellings on Nonconforming Lots. When
construction of a residential dwelling is permitted by paragraph (a) above,
such dwelling shall comply with all regulations applicable to specific
residential dwellings permitted and regulated in the district in which the lot
in question is located. However, the following side yard requirements shall
apply in place of the side yard requirements otherwise applicable:
      (1)   The sum of the widths of the two (2) side yards shall not be less
than twenty (20) percent of the width of the lot; nor shall the width of either
required side yard be less than ten (10) percent of the width of the lot.
      (2)   The width of any side yard that adjoins a public street shall not
in any event be less than ten (10) feet.
   (d)   Assembly of Nonconforming Lots.  Notwithstanding the previous
provisions of this section, the assembly of a group of nonconforming lots and/
or portions of nonconforming lots which are adjacent to each other is
permissible and the parcel resulting from such assembly may be developed in
accordance with the following:
      (1)   If the assembled parcel of land is still nonconforming as defined
in Section
1147.02 (b) of this Zoning Code, then it shall be developed in accordance with
Section
1147.02 (a) and (c) of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   If the assembled parcel of land is no longer nonconforming as
defined in Section
1147.02 (b) of this Zoning Code, then it shall be developed in accordance with
the applicable regulations of the zoning district which the parcel is located.
   (e)   Consistency with Established Pattern of Development. When the pattern
of development in a block has been established, any development involving
nonconforming vacant lots or portions of nonconforming vacant lots shall be
consistent with the established pattern of development.
      (1)   Nonconforming vacant lots and/or portions of nonconforming vacant
lots in the same ownership with adjacent developed or vacant lots shall not be
sold separately from the adjacent lot and/or portion of lot, such that the
resultant parcels conflict with the established pattern.
      (2)   This section shall not prohibit the sale or development of a parcel
that has been in separate ownership from adjoining parcels continuously since
the enactment of this Zoning Code, and such development shall comply with
paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section.
   (f)    Lots that are part of a preliminary plan approval prior to a change
to the underlying zoning of those lots shall be considered legally non-
conforming as long as the preliminary plan is not modified to a degree
requiring Planning Commission approval, abandoned or breached.
   1147.03  NONCONFORMING VACANT LOTS IN OTHER DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Permitted Uses on Nonconforming Lots. In any district other than an
agricultural and/or residential district, notwithstanding the limitations
imposed by other provisions of this Zoning Code, a building designed for any
permitted use in such district may be erected on a nonconforming lot, as
defined in Section
1147.02 of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Required Yards for Uses on Nonconforming Lots. When construction is
permitted by paragraph
1147.03 (a) above, such building shall comply with all regulations applicable
in the district in which the lot in question is located. However, the width of
any required side yard need not be greater than the following:
      (1)   Minimum side yard shall not be less than ten (10) percent of the
lot width.
      (2)   Total of both side yards shall not be less than twenty-five (25)
percent of the lot width.
      (3)   The width of any side yard that adjoins a public street shall not
in any event be less than twelve and one-half (12.5) feet.
   1147.04 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS USED FOR A PERMITTED USE.
   A lawfully existing building or structure which contains no nonconforming
use, but which does not comply with the applicable lot size requirements,
building bulk limitations, or off-street parking requirements, may be continued
so long as it remains otherwise lawful. Such buildings or structures which
shall include off-street surface parking lots are referred to in Sections
1147.02 to
 1147.05 of this Zoning Code, as "nonconforming buildings" and are subject to
the following requirements:
   (a)   Enlargement, Repair, and Alteration. A nonconforming building or
structure may be enlarged, maintained, repaired, or structurally altered.
However, no such enlargement, maintenance, repair, or structural alteration
shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of the
existing nonconformity of all or any part of such building or structure; and
damaged or destroyed buildings or structures shall be subject to the
restrictions in division (b) of this section. Conversions for residential
purposes shall comply with the lot area requirements applicable to vacant
nonconforming lots in Section
1147.02 (a) of this Zoning Code and there shall be no further encroachment upon
any bulk regulations that do not comply with those of the district in which the
conversion is to take place. The extension or enlargement of a nonconforming
building or structure may not occupy ground space suitable and otherwise
available for meeting the off-street parking requirements of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Damage or Destruction. In the event that a nonconforming building or
structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to such an extent that the
cost of restoring it to the condition in which it was before such damage or
destruction exceeds fifty (50) percent of the current replacement cost of the
entire building or structure, exclusive of foundations such building or
structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter conform to the
regulations for the district in which it is located.
   (c)   Moving. No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved in whole
or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any
other lot unless the entire building or structure shall thereafter conform to
the regulations of the district in which it is located after being moved.
   (d)   Removal. Any building or structure, which is removed, shall not be
replaced, unless the entire building or structure shall thereafter conform to
the regulations of the district in which it is located.
   1147.05 NONCONFORMING USE OF BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND LAND.
   When the applicable district regulations of this Zoning Code do not allow as
a permitted use either a use of part or all of a building or other structure
lawfully existing at the time of the adoption of this Zoning Code or amendments
thereto, or a use of land not involving a building or structure lawfully
existing at the time of the adoption of this Zoning Code or amendments thereto,
such existing use may be continued so long as otherwise lawful. Such uses are
referred to in Section
1147.01 to
1147.05 of this Zoning Code, as "nonconforming uses" and are subject to the
following regulations:
   (a)   Ordinary Repair and Maintenance.
      (1)   Work may be done on ordinary maintenance and repairs, or on repair
or replacement of walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing. However, this paragraph
shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of subsections (b) through (j)
of this section.
      (2)   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of a building or other structure
(other than a damaged or destroyed building or other structure subject to the
provisions of division (d)) in accordance with the order of a public official
who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such building
or other structure to be unsafe and orders it restoration to a safe condition.
      (3)   Buildings devoted to nonconforming residential uses in a business
or industrial district may be maintained, repaired, improved, modernized or
enlarged. However, no increase in the number of dwelling units shall be
permitted.
   (b)   Structural Alteration. No structural alteration shall be made unless
the entire building or other structure and the use thereof shall thereafter
conform to the regulations of the district in which such structure is located
except as provided in subsections (c), (d), and (e) below.
   (c)   Extension and Enlargement. The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit a
nonconforming use of a building or structure to be extended, expanded,
enlarged, or increased in intensity subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of such
building or other structure that was lawfully and manifestly designed or
arranged for such use on the effective date of this Zoning Code or any
amendments thereto.
      (2)   A nonconforming use of land may not be extended, enlarged, or
increased in intensity.
      (3)   Nothing contained in this section shall in any way prohibit a
nonconforming use from acquiring additional off-street parking space.
      (4)   Application for an extension or enlargement in accordance with
divisions (c)(1) through (c)(3) shall be noticed and heard in the manner
prescribed for variances.
   (d)   Damage or Destruction. In the event that a nonconforming building or
structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to such an extent that the
cost of restoring it to the condition in which it was before such damage or
destruction exceeds fifty (50) percent of the current replacement cost of the
entire building or structure, exclusive of foundations such building or
structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter conform to the
regulations for the district in which it is located.
   (e)   Moving. No building or other structure that is devoted in whole or in
part to a nonconforming use, shall be moved in whole or in part for any
distance whatever, to any other location on the same lot or any other lot
unless the entire building or other structure and the use thereof shall
thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located
after being so moved. Moreover, no nonconforming use of land shall be moved, in
whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same
or any other lot unless such use shall thereafter conform to the regulations of
the district in which it is located after being moved.
   (f)   Change. The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit a substitution for a
nonconforming use in a building or structure lawfully existing at the time of
the adoption of this Zoning Code subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   A nonconforming use of land may not be changed.
      (2)   Application for a substitution in accordance with paragraph (1)
shall be noticed and heard in the manner prescribed for appeals.
   (g)   Discontinuance.
      (1)   Discontinuance of nonconforming use of land. In the event that
operation of a nonconforming use of land is voluntarily discontinued and
remains vacant for a period of one hundred eighty-three (183) calendar days,
such nonconforming use shall not thereafter be reestablished and any subsequent
use or occupancy of such land shall conform to the regulations of the district
in which it is located.
      (2)   Discontinuance of nonconforming use of buildings or structures. In
the event that operation of a nonconforming use of all of a building or other
structure is voluntarily discontinued and remains vacant for a period of one
hundred eighty-three (183) calendar days, such nonconforming use shall not
thereafter be reestablished, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such
building or other structure shall conform to the regulations of the district in
which it is located.
   (h)   Change to Conforming Use. In the event that the operation of a non-
conforming use of land or building is changed to a conforming use, it shall not
revert back to a non-conforming use.
   (i)   Nonconforming Accessory Uses. No nonconforming accessory use shall
continue after the principal use to which it is accessory has been
discontinued.
   (j)   Nonconforming Signs Not Affected By This Section. This section shall
not be applied to nonconforming signs.

   1149.11 SCREENING/BUFFERING.
   It is the purpose of this section to safeguard the health, property, and
welfare of the citizens of the City of Troy, and to promote a high quality
visual environment by regulating and controlling the design, location, and use
of buffer strips to reduce the level of light and noise emanating from certain
zoning districts within the City of Troy:
   (a)   Standards for Buffer Strips. The landscaping materials used in a
buffer strip shall be a combination of shrubs, trees, grass and/or other ground
cover. The primary landscaping materials used shall be of shrubbery and hedges.
Shrubbery and hedges shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in height and spaced
to prevent vehicle lights originating in parking areas from shining onto
adjacent property.    Trees and other planting materials shall be used to
compliment the shrubbery and hedges. The maximum spacing between trees shall be
forty (40) feet and shall be eight (8) to ten (10) feet in minimum overall
height upon planting and which provide shade or are capable of providing shade
at maturity. Other materials, earthen berms, topography, or fencing may be
considered or required on the merits of the particular project.
   (b)   Plans Required for Buffer Strips. A copy of a landscape plan for the
buffer strip shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator at the time of
submittal of the application for the zoning permit. The plan shall be drawn to
scale, locating the landscaping materials, and providing any other information
deemed necessary under this Zoning Code. The Zoning Administrator may request a
review of the landscape plan by other City Departments. Approval shall be given
only if such landscaping carries out the purposes and standards of this Zoning
Code. Modifications to approved plans shall be resubmitted for approval.
   (c)   Maintenance of Buffer Strips. The property owners and lessee are
responsible for the maintenance of all buffer strips.
   1149.12 USES NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED.
   Any use of land, a structure, or a building that is not specifically named
as a permitted principal or accessory use within any zoning district shall not
be permitted until it is determined by the Zoning Administrator that such use
is similar and compatible to those uses expressly permitted within such
district. The decision of the Zoning Administrator may be appealed as provided
in Section
1137 of this Zoning Code.
   1149.13 PROHIBITION OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA CULTIVATION AND PROCESSING.
   No person or entity shall establish or maintain land, buildings, or premises
for the use of medical marijuana’s cultivation or processing. For purposes of
this section, “medical marijuana cultivator,” and “medical marijuana
processor”, shall be defined as set forth in Chapter 3796 of the Ohio Revised
Code as amended from time to time.
(Ord. 8-2017. Passed 4-3-17.)
   1149.14 PROHIBITION OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES.

with respect to rehabilitation and reclamation of mined-out areas:
      (1)   All excavation shall be made either to a water-producing depth,
such depth to be not less than five (5) feet below the water mark, or shall be
graded or backfilled with non- noxious, non-combustible, and nonflammable
solids, to secure:
         A.   That the excavated area shall not collect, and permit to remain
therein, stagnant water; or
         B.   That the surface of the area which is not permanently submerged
is graded or backfilled as necessary so as to reduce the peaks and depressions
thereof so as to produce a gently rolling surface that will minimize erosion
due to rainfall and which will be in substantial conformity to the adjoining
land area.
      (2)   The banks of all sand and gravel excavations in a water-producing
excavation, and to the pit bottom in a dry operation, shall be sloped to the
water line, at a slope which will not be less than three (3) feet horizontal to
one (1) foot vertical, and the banks shall be restored with vegetation in a
manner set forth in division (c)(3) of this section.

      (5)   All equipment and structures shall be removed from the mined-out
area within six (6) months of the completion of the mining therefrom.
      (6)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such other reasonable
conditions and restrictions as it may deem necessary for the protection of the
public and to encourage the mining and processing of the sand and gravel from
the authorized area.
      (7)   Due to the inherent difficulties in reclaiming and rehabilitating
areas from which stone has been quarried, the Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby
empowered, in the issuance of a conditional use permit for quarrying
operations, to impose such reasonable standards for reclamation as may be
necessary to protect the public interest, without unduly restricting the
operations of the mine owner.

minimum front yard depth, side yard width, or rear yard depth prescribed by the
development standard for the district.
      (2)   In Office-Commercial and Business Districts on the same lot as the
building or use served or within three hundred (300) feet of the nearest point
of the principal structure.
      (3)   In an Industrial District on the same lot as the building or use
served, or within one thousand (1,000) feet of the nearest point of the
principal structure.
   (g)   Time. The parking facilities required under this Zoning Code shall be
made available as soon after the time they become required as weather
conditions permit, but in no case more than six (6) months after the date of
the certificate of occupancy.
   (h)   Restricted Parking Lots. Restricted parking lots are those lots which
do not meet the location standards of Section
1155.07(f) of this Zoning Code.
      (1)   For lots located in Office-Residence, Office-Commercial, Business
or Industrial Districts, an application for a restricted parking lot requires a
variance and shall be filed pursuant to the requirements of this Zoning Code.
      (2)   In addition to meeting the required findings for variances of this
Zoning Code, shall comply with the following standards:
         A.   The parcel of property to be used is located adjacent to an
Office-Residential, Office-Commercial, Business or Industrial District in which
the use is located or is separated from that district by a distance of not more
than fifty (50) feet.
         B.   The parking lot shall be used solely for the parking of passenger
vehicles and shall not be used for repair work, vehicle servicing, loading of
any kind, or the erection of advertising signs of any kind on the lot.
         C.   The parking lot shall be closed between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
unless otherwise modified by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
         D.   All restricted parking lots with ten (10) parking spaces or less
shall provide front, rear and side yards that conform to the requirements set
forth by the underlying zoning district. The yards shall also contain a solid
wall, fence, or dense living hedge of at least four (4) feet in height and one
(1) hardy deciduous canopy tree of at least two (2) inches caliper placed no
farther apart than twenty-five (25) feet on center in the required yard.
         E.   All restricted parking lots with more than ten (10) parking
spaces shall provide side yards abutting a residential district of at least
five (5) feet, plus two (2) additional feet for every ten (10) spaces or part
thereof in excess of ten (10) spaces. Front and rear yards shall conform to the
requirements of the underlying zoning district. The yard shall also contain a
solid wall, fence or dense living hedge of at least six (6) feet in height or
one (1) hardy deciduous canopy tree of at least two (2) inches caliper placed
no farther apart than twenty (20) feet on center in the required yard.
         F.   Where the yard requirements of the district in which the
restricted parking lot is located are stricter than those specified in this
section, then the stricter yard requirements shall apply in addition to the
screening and vegetation requirements specified above.
            1.   No parking shall be permitted in any required yard.
            2.   Restricted parking lots with more than twenty-five (25) spaces
shall provide a landscaped island of at least forty (40) square feet with a
hardy deciduous canopy tree of at least two (2) inches caliper for each twenty-
five (25) spaces or part thereof.
         G.   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall impose such further
restrictions as may be deemed necessary and appropriate in order to reduce the
adverse effect of a restricted parking lot upon the preservation of the
residential character and development of the residence district in which the
parking lot is proposed to be located. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
schedule and hold such public hearings as may be necessary to make detailed
findings and arrive at specific conclusions with respect to the suitability and
applicability of the proposed restricted parking lot.
   (i)   Handicapped Parking. All parking facilities shall have provisions for
the physically handicapped. Such parking spaces shall be located as near as
practicable to the entrance(s) of the building and shall comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.
   (j)   Repair and Service. No motor vehicle repair work or service of any
kind, except emergency repairs, shall be permitted in or in association with
any off-street parking area.
   1155.08  REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS TO OFF-STREET PARKING AREAS.
   (a)   Design. Off-street parking space may be open to the sky, or enclosed
in a building or structure, either above or below ground level. Off-street
parking areas and ingress and egress, shall comply with such design standards
relating to curb, driveway width, island width, barriers, and drainage as may
be established from time to time by the City Engineer. In no case shall off-
street parking spaces or driveways providing access to off-street parking lots,
for other than single or two-family residences, be designed so as to require
motor vehicles to back into public streets in order to exit from the off-street
parking space or off-street lot.
(Ord. 0-27-2008. Passed 3-16-09.)
   (b)   Surfacing. All open off-street parking areas, including associated
driveways, driveway extensions, aisles and circulation areas shall be graded,
and provided with a hard surface of bituminous asphalt or Portland cement
concrete or with a comparable all weather surface acceptable to the Director.
(Ord. 0-2-2010. Passed 2-1-10.)
   (c)   Separation. All open off-street parking areas shall be separated from
public street rights-of-way or setback lines that have been established by this
Zoning Code by a wall, fence, or similar structure or by a strip of ground at
least ten (10) feet in width, and a six (6) inch high poured-in-place concrete
curb shall be provided on the parking lot side of ten (10) foot width,
extending below grade not less than eighteen (18) inches. Additionally, all
off-street parking areas shall be located a minimum of four (4) feet from
adjoining properties.
   (d)   Screening. When any open off-street parking area containing more than
two (2) parking spaces (except parking accessory to a single-family residence)
is adjacent to a lot in an Agricultural, Residence or Office-Residence
District, or is separated only by a dedicated street or alley, an effective
buffer or screen consisting of a solid wall, solid fence, or dense living hedge
shall be provided at the lot line to protect the privacy of the adjoining
residential uses. Such wall, fence, or hedge shall be not less than six (6)
feet in height, except as regulated by Section
 521.07 of the Codified Ordinance.
(Ord. 0-27-2008. Passed 3-16-09.)
   (e)   Lighting. If the off-street parking area consists of more than twenty-
five (25) parking spaces, it shall be provided with lighting in accordance with
Section
1157.06 through
1157.09. Any lighting used to illuminate off-street parking areas shall be
equipped with suitable shielding or be so designed as to avoid casting direct
light upon any other property located in a residential district. (Ord. 0-2-
2010. Passed 2-1-10.)
   (f)   Signs. The Zoning Administrator may require the installation of
directional signs.
   (g)   Drainage.  All open off-street parking areas shall be provided with
adequate drainage facilities as approved by the City Engineer.
   (h)   Interior Design. All parts of open off-street parking areas which are
unusable, either for parking or for traffic, shall be landscaped with plantings
of grass, flowers, shrubs, or trees, which shall be continuously maintained.
   (i)   Marking. Designated parking spaces shall be marked on the surface of
the parking area with white paint or permanent marking materials and maintained
in clearly visible condition. Other paint, marking, or signs shall be placed in
accordance with the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and approved
by the City Engineer.
   (j)   Landscape Design. No parking facility shall be constructed or enlarged
until a landscape plan for such facility has been reviewed and approved by the
Director. City staff may seek the assistance of the City Beautification
Committee in review of such landscape plan. The primary landscaping materials
used in such parking facilities shall be trees which shall be eight (8) feet to
ten (10) feet in minimum overall height upon planting and which provide shade
or are capable of providing shade at maturity.
      (1)   Shrubbery, hedges and other planting materials may be used to
complement the tree landscaping. A guide of planting types deemed acceptable
for landscaping purposes is on file in the office of the planning division of
the Engineering Division and should be consulted prior to design of any parking
facility.
      (2)   In addition to trees, a wall, hedge, or other durable landscape
barrier shall be required. Specific delineation of location and height is found
in Section
1155.08 (d) of this Zoning Code. Walls, as defined in this section, shall mean
wood slat (vertical, horizontal, or basket-weave), brick, stone, and concrete
or masonry, but only if the latter is cement plaster coated. Other materials,
earthen berms, or topography may be used or considered on the merits of the
particular project.
      (3)   The interior dimensions of any planting area or planting median
shall be sufficient to protect the landscaping materials planted therein and to
insure proper growth. In those instances where plant material exists on a
proposed parking facility prior to its development, such landscape material may
be used to meet the requirement of this Zoning Code.
      (4)   Interior Requirements. Within interior vehicular use areas ten
thousand (10,000) square feet or greater in size, and for each additional ten
thousand (10,000) square foot unit or a proportional fraction thereof, a
minimum total of five hundred (500) square feet of landscape area shall be
provided, irrespective of the peripheral requirements. For individual parking
lots with more than five parking spaces, five (5) percent of the vehicular use
area, irrespective of the perimeter requirements, shall be devoted to
landscaping. Planting which is required for screening along peripheral areas of
parking facilities shall not be considered as part of the interior coverage
requirement. A minimum of two (2) trees, each a minimum size of one and three-
quarters (1-3/4) inches in trunk diameter, shall be provided for each ten
thousand (10,000) square foot unit of interior vehicular use area. The minimum
distance from a tree to a vehicular use area shall be four (4) feet measured
from the trunk of the tree.
      (5)   The interior landscape area and trees required for each ten
thousand (10,000) square foot vehicular use area unit or fraction thereof shall
be located within that vehicular use area unit or fraction thereof. In areas
where the Director has determined that the strict application of this Section
will interfere with the function of a vehicular use area, the unused portion of
the required interior landscaping shall be relocated elsewhere on the property
so as to emphasize a landscaping feature.
      (6)   If in the judgment of the Director it has been deemed appropriate,
credit may be received on the interior landscaping plan by preserving existing
trees capable of tolerating adjacent construction. In order to maintain any
tree deemed eligible for credit, the ground area under and within the drip line
of the tree shall be preserved from the trunk out to the edge of the drip line
and shall be maintained in either vegetative landscape material or pervious
surface cover, except when the Zoning Administrator determines that lesser
areas and other ground cover treatment will provide sufficient nourishment for
the continued growth of the preserved type of tree. The required number of new
trees may be reduced in accordance with the following schedule in exchange for
preserving existing trees:
Diameter of Existing Crown Diameter Tree Trunk of Preserved Number of
Spread of Preserved Trees  Tree (*2)                        Trees Credited

(*1)    Rounded off to the nearest whole foot.
(*2)    Measured to a height of four and one-half (4½) feet above the natural
grade and rounded off to the nearest whole inch.
      (7)   Peripheral Requirements. The width of the peripheral landscape
strip of all parking facilities that abut adjoining property that is not street
right-of-way shall be governed by applicable sections under Section
1149, buffer strips. In addition, the landscape strip ten (10) feet in width
shall be required along all sides of parking facilities that abut street
rights-of-way. Such landscape strip shall contain a combination of planting and
complementary materials as noted above. Materials that compose the barrier
requirement shall be no more than three (3) feet in height and shall be
installed at the edge of the landscape strip most distant from the street
right-of-way. One (1) tree shall be planted for each forty (40) feet lineal of
the landscape strip at a minimum distance of six (6) feet from the street
right-of-way.
   1155.09  COMPUTATION.
   (a)   Number of Spaces.  When determination of the number of off-street
parking spaces required by this Zoning Code results in a requirement of a
fractional space, any fraction shall be rounded up and counted as one (1)
parking space.
   (b)   Floor Area. For the purpose of determining off-street parking and off-
street loading requirements, floor area shall be defined to be the sum of the
gross horizontal floor areas of the building, or structure, as measured from
interior of common wall to interior of common wall, which is devoted to a use
requiring off-street parking or loading as provided in this Zoning Code.
   (c)   Collective and Shared Parking. Collective Provision. Off-street
parking facilities for separate uses may be provided collectively and the total
number of spaces so furnished may be reduced up to fifteen (15) percent of the
spaces required for all such separate uses, and provided that all regulations
covering the location of accessory parking spaces in relation to the use served
are observed. A written agreement covering such collective use shall be filed
with the Zoning Administrator.
   (d)   Employee Parking.  Except where otherwise specified, parking spaces
required on an employee basis shall be computed based on the maximum number of
employees on duty or residing, or both, on the premises at any one (1) time.

Districts.
   (c)   Industrial. Shall include all Industrial Zoning Districts.
   1157.06  ILLUMINATION REGULATED.
   There are two (2) characteristics of light which are commonly referred to as
glare. One is the illumination or amount of light falling on a unit surface.
The other is the intensity of light at the source. Both of these factors are a
function of the wattage of a given light source, the type and design of the
luminaire, and the height of the light source. The illumination regulations set
forth in Section
1157.08 through Section
1157.09 of this Zoning Code, are designed to ensure that no light is emitted
above a horizontal line parallel to the ground. In order to achieve total
cutoff at ninety (90) degrees, a luminaire shall emit maximum candlepower at an
angle not exceeding seventy-five (75) degrees.
   1157.07 ILLUMINATION NUISANCE PROHIBITED.
   No activity on private property shall generate light that creates a nuisance
to surrounding properties, as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
   1157.08 ILLUMINATION STANDARDS.
   The following standards are required of all pole-mounted exterior lighting
except the outdoor recreational uses specifically exempted in Section
1157.09(d) of this Zoning Code. Many uses have the option of providing a lower
post with a non-cutoff type luminaire or a higher pole, up to fifty (50) feet,
with a luminaire that totally cuts off light spillover at a cutoff angle
smaller than ninety (90) degrees. The maximum height of light post permitted is
dependent upon the amount of cutoff provided. This is designed as a protection
against excessive glare and light spilling over to neighboring properties.
   1157.09  EXTERIOR LIGHTING.
   Exterior lighting shall meet one of the following standards:
   (a)   Luminares with No Cutoff:
      (1)   Residential Properties:
         A.   Maximum permitted height of fifteen (15) feet.
         B.   Maximum permitted illumination of two-tenths (0.20) foot-candle.
      (2)   Non-residential properties:
         A.   Maximum permitted height of luminaire of twenty (20) feet.
         B.   Maximum permitted illumination of three-tenths (0.30) foot-
candle.
   (b)   Luminaries With Total Cutoff Angle Greater Than Ninety (90) Degrees:
   
      (1)   Residential Properties:
         A.   Maximum permitted height of luminaire of twenty (20) feet.
         B.   Maximum permitted illumination of five-tenths (0.50) foot-candle.
      (2)   Non-residential Properties:
         A.   Maximum permitted height of luminaire of forty (40) feet.
         B.   Maximum permitted illumination of two (2.0) foot-candles.
   (c)   Luminaries with Total Cutoff of Angle Less Than Ninety (90) Degrees.
Luminaries with a total cutoff of angle less than ninety (90) degrees and
located so the bare light bulb, lamp, or light source is completely shielded
from the direct view of an observer five (5) feet above ground at the point
where the cutoff angle intersects the ground, then the maximum permitted
illumination and the maximum permitted height of the luminaire shall be as
follows:
      (1)   Residential Properties:
         A.   Maximum permitted height of luminaire of twenty-five (25) feet.
         B.   Maximum permitted illumination of one (1.0) foot-candle.
      (2)   Nonresidential Properties:
         A.   Maximum permitted height of luminaire of fifty (50) feet.
         B.   Maximum illumination of four (4.0) foot-candles.
   (d)   Requirements for Stadiums. Because of their unique requirements for
providing greater night-time visibility, their need to ensure public safety,
and their limited hours of operation; stadiums (which include ball diamonds,
playing fields, and tennis courts) are exempted from the exterior lighting
standards as specified in (a), (b), and (c) above. A lighting plan for stadiums
shall be established at the time that the request for exterior lighting is
made. Each lighting plan shall take into consideration the follow standards:
      (1)   The height of the stadium light shall be the minimum height
necessary to provide thirty (30) foot-candles of illumination on the playing
surface, but shall not exceed one hundred (100) feet in height. The height of
the stadium light may be increased if the resulting illumination will reduce
glare and spillover illumination.
      (2)   The distance from any adjacent residential property to the stadium
light pole shall be at least one and one half (1 1/2) the height of the
luminaire. Public rights-of-way which fall between a stadium light and adjacent
residential property may be used to calculate this minimum distance.
      (3)   To the maximum extent possible, existing mature vegetation shall be
maintained to screen residential properties from affects of stadium lighting.

it at the last known residence or place of business in the presence of a family
member or other responsible person of suitable age and discretion who shall be
informed of the general nature of the contents thereof.
      (2)   If service is not accomplished by any of the above means, then a
notification of the existence of the notice and order may be published at least
once in a local newspaper of general circulation.
   (e)   Any person failing to comply with a legal notice and requirement as
herein provided shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to
penalties as set forth herein.
   1159.03 STOP-WORK ORDER.

(Ord. 41-99. Passed 11-15-99.)
   1303.04 INSPECTIONS AND FEES FOR INSPECTIONS; PLAN EXAMINATIONS AND PERMITS.
   (a)    Inspections. Prior to concealing or using any assemblage, the
Enforcement Officer shall, upon twenty four hours advance notice and in the
presence of the owner or his duly authorized representative, inspect the
building, including but not limited to, all installations, use, materials, and
assembled manufactured products, pertaining to the approved plans or relative
to a required permit. Such inspections will be made to assure compliance with
all laws, regulations and ordinances applicable to the same.
   (b)    Plan Examination, Inspections and Permit Fees. The bui1ding,
mechanica1, electrical and fire protection permit fees shal1 be paid for al1
work regulated by this Codified Ordinance and shall be calculated by adding the
processing fee, plan examination fee, and inspection fee for each item as shown
in the Fee Tables. Fees for customary building and fire protection inspections
are included in their respective processing and plan exam fees, whereas the
electrical and mechanical inspection fees are charged in addition to their
processing and plan exam fee as noted in Notes 2 through 4, Table
1303.04(d). All fees contained in the permit fee tables, including double fees
imposed according to Section
1303.04(i) shall be paid to the City for deposit to the general fund upon the
filing of an application for permit as required. Failure to be charged the full
amount at time of application will not validate an error or omission that may
have been made by the City in calculating the permit fees. Though every effort
is made to quote an accurate fee, there may have been inaccurate information,
obscured floor areas or hidden work that wasn't noticed at time of application
but later discovered during the actual plan examination.
    All fees shall be paid prior to release of any permit.
      (1)   Permit fee/tables. Whenever a permit is required for work regulated
by the State or Local Code adopted in Section
1303.01, the permit fee for a building, mechanical, electrical or fire
protection permit shall consist of a plan exam, processing and inspection fee
for each type of permit applied for. The most applicable of Tables
1303.04(d) through (g) will be used to assess the plan exam/processing fee and
the inspection fees will be assessed in accordance to Table 713.13(b) for
electrical work and Table 727.13(b) for mechanical work. Inspection fees for
building and fire protection permits are included in the plan exam/processing
fee charged for such permits.
         A.   A local plan exam/processing fee will not be charged for the
mechanical or electrical work if such work is related to an outstanding
“building” permit which has been issued by the City of Troy for one, two or
three family structure regulated by local codes. Once the work associated with
the “building” permit has been completed, the permit is no longer outstanding
and a 1ocal plan exam/processing fee will be charged for each type of plan
identified in Table
1303.04(f) or Table
1303.04(g), whichever is most applicable.
         B.   When Local or State Regulated building, mechanical , electrical
or fire protection work is for the repair, replacement, alteration, relocation
, addition, reconstruction, or for the incidental upkeep to maintain the
existing building, structure or service equipment, the Troy Chief Building
Official shall be notified and shall determine whether or not a permit or plan
review is required. If required, the Troy Chief Building Official shall apply
local plan exam/processing fees as stated in subsection (b)(1)A hereof or State
plan exam/processing fees in accordance with Table
1303.04(d) through (e), whichever is most applicable.
   (c)    Inspection, Reinspections and Special Inspections. No regular
inspections will be performed until the permit fees are paid and the permit
approved. A reinspection fee as noted in the Fee Tables will be assessed
whenever the customary inspections noted on the permits have been exceeded and
a second reinspection is made. Each request for special inspections must be
considered separately because such inspections are not necessary to assure
compliance to current permits nor are permits required to perform such
inspections. If such a request is granted, a special inspection fee will be
assessed for each inspection as noted in the Fee Tables. No regular or special
inspection will be performed until all fees are paid.
   (d)    State Fees; New Work. The fees for inspection of plans and
specifications required to be submitted for approval under the state code
adopted in Section
1303.01 relative to new buildings or structures, additions or the placement of
industrialized units shall be per Table
1303.04(d). The permit fee as identified in subsection (b) hereof shall be
based on the gross floor area of each floor level under consideration and shall
be collected for each item mentioned in the Table. See subsection (I) hereof
relative to work without a permit.

4. Contract Inspection                               $ 15.00 each
Note 1:    The term "value of work" as used in this Table, means the fair
market value of all services, labor and materials used. Services, labor, or
materials donated or performed at cost will be subject to the same fair market
values as work done for profit.
Note 2:    See Notes 2, 3 and 4 of Table
1303.04(d).
Note 3:    A reinspection fee is applicable whenever two or more reinspections
are requested to check corrected violations of the code or to inspect work
which was not completed during prior inspections.
Note 4:    Special inspections have to be requested as outlined in Section
1303.04(c) of the Codified Ordinances.
Note 5:    Fees shall be additive for each type of work described above.
Note 6:    The Troy Building Official shall determine the proper use of the fee
schedule and its applicability. Appeal from a decision of the Building Official
shall be made to the Director of Public Service and Safety.
   (h)    Change of Use Fees. When the change of use in any building or
structure does not require permits for work identified above, but still
requires a plan review for a Certificate of Occupancy, a fee for review,
processing and inspections shall be assessed for each floor level requiring the
review. Such fee shall be ten dollars ($10.00) plus one dollar ($1.00) per 100
sq. ft. or part thereof for each type of plan or feature reviewed and
identified in Table
1303.04 (d). The fees shall be based on the gross floor area of each floor
level under consideration.
   (i)    Work Started Without Permits. An additional fee equal to one hundred
percent (100%) of the plan exam, processing and inspection fee assessed
according to the Tables above shall be paid by the owner when such work is
started before a permit is secured unless such work is done as an emergency
measure to temporarily abate the imminent hazard until the required information
can be submitted for approval and permit(s). The payment of such additional fee
shall not relieve any person from fully complying with the requirements of the
code nor from the inspections required to determine compliance therewith.
   (j)    Refunds. In the case of revocation of a permit or abandonment for
discontinuance of a building project, that portion of work actually completed
by the jurisdictions shall be computed and any excess fee for the incomplete
work shall be returned to the applicant upon written request. However, fees to
be refunded shall not include any processing or penalty fees. All plan
examination, processing, and inspection fees and all penalties that may have
been imposed on the applicant under the requirements of this code shall first
be collected before computing excess fees.
   (k)    Time Limit of Application. An incomplete application for a permit for
any proposed work shall be deemed to have been abandoned six months after the
date of filing, unless such application has been diligently prosecuted or a
permit shall have been issued; except that the Troy Building Official shall
grant one or more extensions of time for additional periods not exceeding
ninety days each if there is reasonable cause.
   (1)    Suspension of Permit. For any proposed work requiring a permit
anywhere within the Codified Ordinances, the permit shall be subject to the
same expiration provisions and renewal fee found in Section 1133.041 of this
Codified Ordinance except that work regulated by state codes shall be subject
to OAC Rule 4101:2-1-23 (F) found in the Ohio Basic Building Code.
   (m)    Special Services. A fee of forty dollars ($40.00) per hour will be
assessed for the excessive review of preliminary plans submitted for
evaluations; or for the special evaluations of products, materials or methods
which require the conditions of acceptability to be defined for applicable code
(s); or for other services not provided for elsewhere and involving unusual
requests which may serve as a convenience to one but by its nature imposes an
excessive or unusual hardship on the standard operating procedures of the
department.
(Ord. 40-91. Passed 12-2-91; Ord. 23-92. Passed 9-21-92.)
   1303.99 PENALTY.

that person was previously convicted hereunder, shall be fined not more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more than sixty days, or both.

dollars ($500.00).

(Ord. 23-85. Passed 8-19-85.)
   1313.06 STANDARDS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
   To guide an applicant through the rehabilitation process, the following ten
standards, as developed by the United States Secretary of the Interior, will
provide the initial direction. The standards for rehabilitation are as follows:
   (a)    Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for
a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or site
and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose.
   (b)    The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
    (c)    All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
   (d)    Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence
of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and its
environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right,
and this significance shall be recognized and respected.
    (e)    Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
    (f)    Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features should be based on accurate duplications of features,
substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements
from other buildings or structures.
   (g)    The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
   (h)    Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to any property.
   (i)    Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood or environment.
   (j)    Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall
be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
   The United States Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation
and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings (Revised 1983), and any
subsequent reviews will be available to an applicant at the Building
Inspector's office. The Building Inspector will enforce all other codes the
City has adopted.
(Ord. 23-85. Passed 8-19-85.)
   1313.07 DUTIES OF THE BOARD.
   (a)    It shall be the duty of the Board of Architectural Review to review
all applications for work pertaining to the construction, alteration, repair,
painting (if color change occurs), moving and demolition of structures in the
Historical Troy Architectural District. The Board shall act as advisor to the
City Planning Commission in all matters under the provisions of this chapter
and make recommendations to the Commission for approval or disapproval of
applications brought before it concerning:
      (1)    The historical or architectural value and significance of the
structure and its relationship to historic value of the surrounding area;
      (2)    The general compatibility of exterior design, arrangement, texture
and materials proposed to be used; and
      (3)    To other relevant factors which are in conformance with the
purpose of this chapter.
    (b)    It is the intent of this chapter that the Board shall encourage that
the making of alterations and repairs to structures in the District be made in
the spirit of their architectural style, and that additions to structures be
made in styles which shall complement the original architectural style. The
Board shall be lenient in its judgment of plans for new construction,
renovation, rehabilitation or for alteration, repair or demolition of
structures of little historic or cultural value except where such construction,
alteration, repair or demolition would seriously impair the historic value and
character of surrounding structures or the surrounding area. It is not the
intent of this chapter to limit new construction to any one period of
architectural style.
   (c)    The Board shall have the power to call in experts to aid in its
deliberations.
(Ord. 23-85. Passed 8-19-85.)
   1313.08 REVIEW OF APPLICATION AND PLANS.
   (a)    Application to construct, alter, repair, move or demolish any
structure in the Historical Architectural District shall be made to the
Building Inspector. Plans shall be submitted showing the structure in question
and showing its relationship to adjacent structures.
   (b)    The Inspector shall examine the application contents for conformance
to the appropriate codes. Upon completion of his examination, the Inspector
shall notify the Board of Architectural Review of the receipt of such
application and shall transmit it together with accompanying plans, inspection
comments and other information to the Board. The Inspector is authorized to
contact the applicant for correction and additional information, but shall in
any event submit the application to the Board within ten working days of the
receipt of same.
   (c)    The Board shall notify the applicant of the date and time of the
meeting and at such meeting shall review the application relative to the
criteria of this chapter and its regulation, shall review any comments and
recommendations of the Inspector and shall hear and review the comments,
exhibits or other relevant information presented by any other interested
persons attending the meeting in person or by counsel.
   Upon completion of the application review, the Board shall inform the
applicant of its action. Action by the Board may follow three different
alternatives:
       (1)    Should the application be approved, the Board shall transmit its
review with the applicant's plan to the City Planning Commission.
       (2)    Should the Board disapprove such plan, it shall make
recommendations for modifications to the applicant. Should the applicant agree
to the modifications, a record of this action shall be transmitted to the
Commission reflecting approval of the plan, as modified.
       (3)    Should the applicant refuse to carry out the recommendations of
the Board, the Board shall transmit a record of the action to the Commission
reflecting the Board's reasons for disapproval.
         (Ord. 23-85. Passed 8-19-85.)
   1313.09 PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL.
   (a)    Application to construct, alter, repair, move or demolish any
structure in the Historical Architectural District shall be reviewed at the
next meeting of the Planning Commission after receipt of the review and
recommendations of the Board of Architectural Review. The applicant shall be
notified to appear at that meeting.
   (b)    Upon its conclusion of an examination of the review and
recommendations of the Board, and any further information requested by or
received by the Commission, the Commission shall determine by a vote of its
members, whether the application for the work shall be approved. If approved,
the Commission shall return the application and appended material to the
Building Inspector for the necessary permits. If not approved, the Commission
shall return the application
and appended material to the Inspector with the instruction that the permit not
be issued together with its reasons, in writing, as to why the applicant failed
to meet the intent and purpose of this chapter.
   (c)    In the event the work requested is for demolition and approved by the
Commission, and unless there are overriding concerns for public health and
safety, such demolition permit shall not become effective until three months
after the date of such issuance in order to provide a period of time within
which it may be possible to relieve a hardship and to cause the property to be
transferred to another owner who will retain the structure. Only those
buildings listed on the National Register will be subject to the waiting
period. The Board will be notified of all demolitions within the District.
(Ord. 23-85. Passed 8-19-85.)
