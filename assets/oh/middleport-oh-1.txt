ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO. 1002-73
An ordinance to approve, adopt and enact the Codified Ordinances of the Village
of Middleport, Ohio; to repeal ordinances in conflict therewith; to publish the
enactment of new matter therein; and declaring an emergency.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Middleport, Ohio, has had the matter
of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED, by the Council of the Village of Middleport
as follows:
   Sec. I.  That the ordinances of the Village of Middleport, Ohio, of a
general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated
into component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved,
adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Middleport, Ohio, 1973.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Middleport,
Ohio.
   Sec. II.  That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of
the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section V of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to November 12, 1973, which are inconsistent with any provision
of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of
this Ordinance except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)    The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)    The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)    The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)    The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness.
      (6)    The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges.

shall cause to be published in a manner required by law this Adopting Ordinance
together with a summary of the new matter contained in the codification adopted
hereby.
   Sec. IV.  That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the Village, the reason for the necessity being
that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
Village, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation and avoid
practical and legal entanglements.
   Sec. V.  This Ordinance shall take effect and be in force from and after
January 1, 1974.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal.  As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not

this end the provisions are severable.

Official Standards
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on eastern daylight savings time
from 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in 0ctober. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of daylight savings time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
daylight savings time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature through inaction has elected to
observe eastern daylight savings time throughout the State of Ohio.

at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).  Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months.  "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases. 
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above.  Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973):  "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C).  If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality.  Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is
set forth in Rule 9(C):  "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall
make a written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any.  Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case.  Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

161.02   Contempt.

earned, the tax is payable on the gross amounts received.
      (2)    Amounts received from the employer by way of expenses and not by
way of compensation, and used as such by the individual receiving them, are not
deemed to be compensation if the employer deducts such expense advances as such
from his gross income for the purpose of determining his net profits taxable
under this chapter.
      (3)    If such commissions are included in the net earnings of a trade,
business, profession, enterprise or activity regularly carried on by such

181.03(a). They shall not again be separately taxed, in such case, such net
earnings shall be taxed as provided in Section
183.11.
   (d)    The receipt of fees and other compensation for personal services
rendered shall be deemed to be subject to taxation under this chapter.
   (e)    Domestic servants are subject to Village tax under this chapter but
are not subject to withholding provisions. That is to say, the domestic will
report earnings and pay the tax directly to the Middleport Income Tax
Department.

      (8)    Where such non-profit association or organization conducts income
producing business both within and without the corporate limits, it shall
calculate its profits allocable to the Village under the methods provided

(Ord. 1195-88.  Passed 4-11-88.)
183.05  IMPOSITION OF TAX; NET BUSINESS PROFITS; RESIDENTS.
   (a)    In the case of trades, businesses, professions, other activities,

   (b)    For the purpose of construing Section

itself, as distinguished from the partners, proprietors or other participants
in its profits.
   (c)    Generally, a partnership, association or other unincorporated
enterprise owned by two or more persons will be taxed as an entity. However, in
the case of a non- resident partnership, association or unincorporated
enterprise which cannot be reached or taxed directly by the Village, or if only
part of its earnings may be directly taxed, then in either such case, resident
partners, co-owners, proprietors or other participants in the profits thereof
must include in their declaration and tax return or returns their distributive
shares of such profits or portion thereof not taxed to the business enterprise
as an entity, and must pay the tax thereon.
   (d)    The tax imposed under Section
181.03 is levied upon the entire net profits of the resident trade, business,
profession, other activity, enterprise or undertaking, wherever earned, paid or
accrued and regardless of the fact that any part of such business or
professional activity may have been conducted at or through a place or places
of business located outside the Village.

(1%) earned or accruing on and after July 1, 1988 of such trade, business,
profession, enterprise, undertaking or other activity if and to the extent
conducted in or derived from activity in the Village.
   (b)    A nonresident entity within the meaning of Section
181.03 which has a branch or branches, office or offices and/or store or
stores, warehouse or other place or places in which the entity's business is
transacted, located in the Village, shall be considered to be conducting,
operating, prosecuting or carrying on a trade, business, profession,
enterprise, undertaking or other activity to the full extent of the sum total
of all transactions originating or consummated in, by or through the Middleport
branch, office, store, warehouse, or other place of business including:
      (1)    Billings made on such transactions; or
      (2)    Services rendered; or
      (3)    Shipments made; or

      (5)    Commissions, fees, other remuneration or payments earned.
   (c)    In the case of the partnership, association or other unincorporated
business owned by one or more persons, the tax generally, shall be upon such
partnership, association or business enterprise as an entity and not ordinarily
upon the partners or members thereof. However, the provisions of Section

non- resident business entity having a place or places of business within and
outside the Village, such business entity may, at its option, use and apply the

183.07  IMPOSITION OF TAX; NET BUSINESS PROFITS; CORPORATIONS.
   (a)    In the case of a corporation doing business in Middleport whether
domestic or foreign, and whether domiciled in Middleport, or elsewhere, there
is imposed an annual tax of one percent (1%) on that part of the corporations
which is earned by such corporations as a result of work done or services
performed or rendered and business or other activities conducted in the
Village.
   (b)    The provisions of Section
183.06 are applicable to such corporations.
   (c)    A corporation doing business both within and outside the Village may
in determining the part of the net profits which are taxable under this
chapter, at its option:
      (1)    Use the usual accounting system of the taxpayer corporation, so
long as the usual accounting system shall be one acceptable to the U.S.
Internal Revenue Department as evidenced by acceptance and approval of income
tax returns filed herein, or
      (2)    Use the business allocation percentage formula set forth in
Section
181.03.  (Ord. 1195-88.  Passed 4-11-88.)
183.08  BUSINESS ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE.
   (a)    At the option of a corporate taxpayer or of a nonresident business
entity, such taxpayers may, but are not obligated to, use the formula set forth
in Section
181.03 to compute the percentage of their entire net profits (derived from
activities both within and outside the Village) which is taxable under the
chapter, and to determine the tax payable to the Village thereunder.
   If the taxpayer did not have a place of business outside Middleport during
the period covered by the declaration and/or return required under the chapter,
its business allocation percentage is one hundred percent (100%), in other
words, the taxpayer is required to pay a tax of one percent (l %) on the entire
net profits of the business.
   If the taxpayer had a place of business outside of Middleport and was doing
business in Middleport during such period the business allocation percentage
shall be computed on the following basis:
      (1)    In the taxation of income which is subject to taxation by the
provision of this chapter, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a
business or profession both within and without the boundaries of the Village,
shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is
attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted within the
boundaries of the Village. Then only such portion shall be considered as having
a taxable situs in the Village for purposes of Village income taxation. In the
absence of such records, net profit from a business or profession conducted
both within and without the boundaries of the Village shall be considered as
having a taxable situs in the Village for the purpose of Village income
taxation in the same proportion as the average ratio of:
         A.    The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village during the taxable period to the average net book value of all the real
and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
         B.    Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
         C.    Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services
wherever made or performed.
In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations be substituted
so as to produce such result.
      (2)    As used in subsection (a)(l)C., "sales made in the Village" means:
         A.    All sales of tangible personal property delivered within the
Village regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from stock of
goods within the Municipal Corporation.
         B.    All sales of tangible personal property delivered within the
Village regardless of where title passes, even though transported from a point
outside the Village, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees, in the solicitation, or promotion of sales which result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         C.    All sales of tangible personal property shipped from a place
within the Village to purchasers outside the Village regardless of where title
passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in
the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
   The business allocation percentage is computed by determining the
percentages (1) which Middleport real and tangible personal property bears to
all real and tangible personal property (including that situated in Middleport)
of taxpayer wheresoever situated; (2) which Middleport business sales bear to
taxpayer's entire business sales wheresoever derived (including those derived
from Middleport)  and (3) which payrolls paid by taxpayer within Middleport
bear to taxpayer's entire payroll wheresoever paid (including Middleport
payrolls), adding together the three percentages so arrived at and dividing the
total by 3.
   However, if one of the factors (property sales and payrolls) is missing, the
other two percentages are added and the sum is divided by 2, and if 2 of the
factors are missing, the remaining percentage is the business allocation
percentage.
EXAMPLE 1:
Corporation having places of business in Middleport, Detroit and Cleveland.
Middleport real and tangible personal property: $10,000.00
All real and personal property (Middleport, Detroit, Cleveland) $100,000.00
Percentage: 10 percent
Middleport sales: $15,000
All sales: $75,000
Percentage: 20 percent
Middleport payroll: $6,000
All payroll: $20,000
Percentage: 30 percent
Business allocation percentage: 10 percent plus 20 percent plus 30 percent over
3 equals 20 percent.
EXAMPLE 2:
Same corporation owning real and tangible personal property anywhere:
Middleport sales: $15,000
All sales: $75,000
Percentage: 20 percent
Middleport payroll: $6,000
All payroll: $20,000
Percentage: 30 percent
Business allocation percentage: 20 percent plus 30 percent over 2 equals 25
percent.
EXAMPLE 3:
Same corporation owning real and tangible personal property in Middleport
valued at $10,000 and owning no real and tangible personal property outside
Middleport.
Other factors same as in Example 1 and 2.
Business allocation percentage: 100 percent plus 20 percent plus 30 percent
over 3 equals 50 percent.
   After determining such business allocation percentage, the tax shall be
determined by applying that percentage to the entire net profits of the
taxpayer, wherever derived (thus arriving at the taxable net profit), and
computing one percent (1%) of the resultant taxable net profit.
   In case it should appear to the Village Tax Administrator that any
agreement, understanding or arrangement exists between the taxpayer and any
other person, firm or corporation, whereby the activity, business, income or
capital of the taxpayer is improperly or inaccurately reflected, the Village
Tax Administrator may adjust items of income, deductions and capital, and
disregard assets in computing any allocation percentage, provided any income
directly traceable thereto is also excluded from entire net income, so as to
equitably determine the tax.
   (b)    Explanation of "property factor". The percentage of the taxpayer's
real and tangible personal property within the Village is determined by
dividing the net book value (during the period covered by the report) of such
property within Middleport without deduction of any encumbrances, by the
average net book value similarly computed, of all such property within and
without Middleport. Only property owned by the taxpayer is considered in
determining such percentage.
   (c)    Explanation of "business receipts factor". Receipts from the
following are also allocable to Middleport.
      (1)    Work done or performed or services rendered in Middleport.
      (2)    Rentals from property situated in Middleport where the rental of
such property, is a usual or normal part of the taxpayer's business activity.
      (3)    All other business receipts earned in Middleport, for the purpose
of determining business allocation percentage, no account shall be given to
receipts, within or without Middleport, of income derived from intangibles
(including stocks, bonds, royalties and the like), the income of which is
taxable under the statutes of the State of Ohio.
   All receipts of the period covered by the report (computed on the cash or
accrual basis, in accordance with the method of accounting used in the
computation of the taxpayer's entire net income) must be taken into account.
   (d)    Compensation for work done and performed or services rendered.
      (1)    Compensation and other receipts for work done or services
performed within Middleport are allocable to Middleport and taxable under this
chapter. All amounts so received, credited or charged by taxpayer in payment
for such work or services are so allocable, irrespective of whether done or
performed by employees or agents of taxpayer, by sub-contractors, or by any
other persons, it is immaterial where such amounts were payable or where they
were received.
      (2)    Commission or fees received by the taxpayer are allocated to
Middleport if the services for which the commissions were paid were performed
in Middleport, if the taxpayer's services for which commissions or fees were
paid were performed for the taxpayer by salesmen or other agents or employees
attached to or working out of a Middleport place of business of the taxpayer,
the taxpayer's services will be deemed to have been performed in Middleport.
   Where a lump sum is received by the taxpayer in payment of services within
and without Middleport, the amount attributable to services within Middleport,
is to be determined on the basis of such services within and without
Middleport.
      (3)    Other business receipts. Receipts from sale of capital assets
(property not held by the taxpayer for sale to customers in the regular course
of business) are not business receipts. Receipts from the sale of real property
held by the taxpayer as a dealer for sale to customers in the regular course of
business are business receipts and are allocable to Middleport if the real
property was situated in Middleport. Receipts from sales of intangibles
included in business capital, held by the taxpayer as a dealer for sale to
customers in the regular course of business, are business receipts and are
allocable to Middleport if the sales were made in Middleport or through a
regular place of business of the taxpayer in Middleport.
   (e)    Payroll factor. The percentage of the taxpayer's payroll allocable to
Middleport is determined by dividing the wages, salaries and other personal
service compensation of the taxpayer's employees during such period.
   Wages, salaries and other compensation are computed on the cash or accrual
basis in accordance with the method of accounting used in the computation of
the entire net income of the taxpayer.
   Employees within Middleport include all employees regularly connected with
or working out of a place of business maintained by the taxpayer in Middleport,
irrespective of where the services of such employee were performed. However, if
the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that
because of the fact that a substantial part of payroll was paid to employees
attached to a Middleport place of business who performed a substantial part of
their services outside Middleport, the computation of the payroll factor
according to the general rule stated above would not produce an equitable
result, then the Administrator may, in his discretion, permit the payroll
factor to be computed on the basis of the amount of compensation paid for
services rendered within and without the Village. On the other hand, wherever,
it appears that because of substantial part of the taxpayer's payroll was paid
to employees attached to places of business outside Middleport who performed a
substantial part of their services within Middleport, the computation of the
payroll factor according to the general rule would not properly reflect the
amount of the taxpayer's business done within Middleport by its employees, the
Village's Tax Administrator may require the payroll factor to be computed on
the basis of the amount of compensation paid for services performed within and
without the Village. In any such case, where an employee performed services
both within and without Middleport, the amount treated as compensation for
services performed within Middleport shall be deemed to be:
      (1)    In the case of an employee whose compensation depends directly on
the volume of business secured by him, such as a salesman on a commission
basis, the amount received by him for business attributable to his efforts
within Middleport;
      (2)    In the case of an employee whose compensation depends on other
results achieved, the proportion of the total compensation which the value of
his services within Middleport bears to the value of all his services; and
      (3)    In the case of an employee compensated on a time basis, the
proportion of the total amount received by him which the working time employed
in Middleport bears to the total working time.
   (f)    Adjustment of business allocation percentage formula. Generally, the
business allocation percentage formula will result in a fair apportionment of
the taxpayer's net profits within and without Middleport. However, due to the
peculiar circumstances of certain businesses, the formula may work a hardship
in some cases, or result in a tax evasion in others, thus not to do justice to
the taxpayer or the Village. Accordingly in such cases, the Village's Tax
Administrator may substitute factors calculated to bring about a fair and
proper allocation in any case where the taxpayer has adopted the optional use
of the business allocation percentage formula.  (Ord. 1195-88.  Passed 4-11-
88.)

(Ord. 1195-88.  Passed 4-11-88.)
183.11  NET BUSINESS PROFITS.
   In amplification of the definitions contained in Section
183.01(g) of these regulations but not in limitation thereof, the following
additional information and requirements respecting net business profits are
furnished.
   (a)    Where necessary to properly reflect income, inventories must be used.
The basis of pricing used for the purpose of the Federal income must in each
instance be used.
   (b)    Where the books and records are kept on an "accrual basis," "long-
term contract basis", or "installment basis" and/or the accrual basis, long-
term contract basis or installment basis is used in the filing of Federal
income tax returns, such basis must be used for the purpose of the tax.
   (c)    If the return is made on a "cash basis" gross profit shall include
receipts from commissions, fees and interest, as well as the gross profit or
loss from sales of merchandise, chattels, goods, wares, securities, notes,
choses in action and services except as hereinafter provided.
   (d)    If the return is made on an "accrual basis" gross profit shall
include:
      (1)    Commissions, fees and interest earned; plus
      (2)    The gross profit or loss from sales of merchandise, chattels,
goods, wares, securities, notes, choses in action and services, except as
hereinafter provided.
   (e)    From gross profit, there shall be subtracted allowable expenses to
arrive at the net profits subject to tax.
   (f)    All ordinary and necessary expenses of doing business including
reasonable compensation paid employees, shall be allowed (but no deduction may
be claimed for "salary" or withdrawals of a proprietor or of the partners,
members or other co-owners of an unincorporated business or enterprise).
   (g)    If not claimed as part of the cost of goods sold or elsewhere in the
return filed, there may be claimed and allowed a reasonable deduction for
depreciation, depletion, obsolescence, losses resulting from theft or casualty
not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, of property used in the trade or
business, but the amount may not exceed that recognized for the purpose of the
Federal income tax. Provided, however, that loss on the sale, exchange or other
disposition of the depreciable property and real estate used in business, shall
not be allowed as a deductible expense.
   (h)    Bad debts in a reasonable amount may be allowed in the year
ascertained worthless and charged off, or if the reserve method is used, a
reasonable addition to the reserve may be claimed, but in no event shall the
amount allowed exceed the amount recognized as a deduction for the purpose of
the Federal income tax.
   (i)    Only taxes directly connected with the taxpayer's business may be
claimed as a deduction if for any reason the income from property is not
subject to tax, then the tax on such property is not deductible. In any event,
the following taxes are not deductible from income.
      (1)    The tax under this chapter.
      (2)    Any Federal taxes based upon income.
      (3)    Gifts, estate or inheritance taxes, and
      (4)    Taxes for local benefits or improvements to property which tend to
appreciate the value thereof.
   (j)    Capital gains and losses, including gains or losses from the sale,
exchange or other disposition of depreciable business property, and real
property used in the taxpayer's trade or business, shall not be taken into
consideration in arriving at "net profits earned".
   (k)    If the taxpayer is a nonresident, only the amount of net profits
applicable to the activities of the business in Middleport shall be subjected
to tax. If the nonresident taxpayer's records do not disclose the actual net
profits from the Middleport branch, office, store or activity separately, then
the basis of allocation shall be disclosed in the return. If such basis of
allocation is not deemed correct in view of all the known circumstances, the
Tax Administrator shall make a re-allocation based upon gross receipts or any
other basis which shall, under the circumstances of the case, more accurately
reflect the net profits.
   (l)    In general, all business expense recognized and to the extent allowed
as such for the purpose of determining Federal income tax will be recognized
and allowed for determining Middleport income tax under the provisions of this
chapter. However, all expenses connected with the acquisition of carrying of
securities, the income from which is not recognized as taxable under this
chapter, may not be deducted in determining taxable net profits hereunder.
   (m)   In general, unearned income is not to be included in computing the tax
levied hereunder. Gain or loss from the sale, exchange or other disposition of
capital assets, including depreciable property and real estate used in
business, shall not be included in determining net profits. Income from
intangibles, by way of dividends, interest and the like, should not be included
in property from which such income is derived is subject to taxation under the
intangible personal property tax laws of the State, or is specifically exempted
from taxation under those laws.
   (n)   Rentals received by the taxpayer are to be included only if and to the
extent that the rental, ownership, management or operation of the real estate
from which such rentals are derived (whether so rented, managed or operated by
the taxpayer individually or through agents or other representatives)
constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in part.
   Following are the circumstances under which, in any instance, the rental of
any real property shall or shall not be deemed to be in a "business activity".
      (1)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of one hundred dollars
($100.00) per month, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties is a business activity of
such taxpayer, and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax, provided that in case of commercial property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed
or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00) per
month, provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in the crops or when
the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net. receipts derived from
the farms, whether or not the gross income exceeds one hundred dollars
($100.00) per month, and provided, further, that the person who operates a
rooming house shall be considered in business whether or not the gross income
exceeds one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month.
      (2)    In determining the amount of gross monthly rental of any real
property, periods during which (by reason of vacancy or any other cause)
rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the taxpayer.
      (3)    Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying
and selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.
      (4)    Real property, as the term is used in this regulation, shall
include commercial property, residential property, farm property and any and
all other types of real estate.
      (5)    In determining the taxable net income from rentals, the deductible
expenses shall be of the same nature, extent and amount as are allowed by the
Department of Internal Revenue for Federal income tax purposes.
      (6)    Residents of Middleport are subject to taxation upon the net
income from rentals (to the extent above specified) regardless of the location
of the real property owned.
   Nonresidents of Middleport are subject to such taxation only if the real
property is situated within the Village. Nonresidents, in determining whether
gross rentals exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall take into
consideration only real estate situated within Middleport.
      (7)    Income from royalties or copyrights is not to be included.
         (Ord. 1195-88.  Passed 4-11-88.)
183.12  RECONCILIATION WITH FEDERAL RETURN.
   If, as a result of a change made in business income by the Federal Bureau of
Internal Revenue, or by a judicial decision, an additional amount will result
as owing to the Village, a report of such change shall be filed by the taxpayer
within three months after receipt of the final notice of such change from the
Federal authorities or after final decision of a court adjudicating any such
Federal income tax liability.
(Ord. 1195-88. Passed 4-11-88.)
183.13  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)    On or before April 30, 1989, every taxpayer engaged in any business,
the net profits of which are subject in whole or in part to the tax imposed by
this chapter, shall make and file with the Village Tax Administrator, a final
return on a form furnished by or obtainable from the Tax Administrator.
Thereafter, each such taxpayer shall, on or before April 30 of each subsequent
year, make and file a final return with the Tax Administrator. Like returns
shall be filed at the same time and in the same manner by all persons whose
wages, salaries, bonuses, incentive payments, commissions, fees and other
compensation received during the preceding taxable year are subject to the tax
imposed by the chapter. However, where an employee's entire earnings for the
year are paid by an employer and the one percent (1%) tax thereon has, in each
instance, been withheld and deducted by the employer from the gross amount of
the entire earnings of such employee-taxpayer, and where the employer of such
employee has filed a report or return in which such employee's entire and only
earnings are reported to the Tax Administrator, and where such employee has no
taxable income other than such earnings, it shall not be necessary for such
employee to file a return for any taxable year in which such conditions have
prevailed.
   Any person who received both compensation for services performed for an
employer in whatsoever form and in addition receives income from any business
activity or occupation not subject to withholding under the chapter must file a
declaration and a final return.
   (b)    In all returns filed hereunder, there shall be set forth the
aggregate amount of salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive payments, commissions,
fees and other compensation received and/or net profits earned (all as
hereinbefore defined) by and during the preceding year and subject to such tax,
together with such pertinent information as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (c)    If the return is made for a fiscal year or for any period other than
a calendar year, the return shall be made within four months from the end of
such fiscal year or other period.
   (d)    The return shall also show the amount of the tax imposed by the
chapter on such earnings or net profits or both.
   (e)    The taxpayer making the return shall at the time of filing thereof,
pay to the Village the amount of tax shown to be due and unpaid by the return.
If, pursuant to the provisions of Section
183.19 the taxpayer shall show the amount of overpayment and may in the amount
thereof be credited against the amount which will be required to be paid by the
taxpayer on the next succeeding installment of tax which may be due.
   For payments in installments, see Section
183.19.
   (f)    Where any portion of the tax otherwise due shall have been deducted
at the source and shall have been paid to the Village by the person making the
deduction, a credit equal to the amount so paid shall be deducted from the
amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable
at the time of the filing of the return.
   (g)    Upon written request of the taxpayer, the Village Tax Administrator
may extend the time for filing the annual return for a period of not more than
six months or not more than thirty days beyond any extension requested of and
granted by the Bureau of Internal Revenue for filing of the Federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 1195-88. Passed 4-11-88.)
183.14  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)    It is the duty of each employer (as hereinbefore defined) who employs
one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis,
to deduct from compensation paid to any employee subject to this chapter, the
tax of one percent (1%) of such salary, wage, bonus, incentive payment,
commission or other compensation due by the employer to the employee. The tax
shall be deducted by the employer from:
      (1)    All compensation paid to employees who are nonresidents of the
Village for services rendered, work performed or other activities engaged in to
earn such compensation within the Village, and
      (2)    From the gross amount of all salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive
payments, commissions or other forms of compensation paid to employees who are
residents of the Village, regardless of the place where the services are
rendered.
   (b)    All employers who or which maintain an office in Middleport are
required to make the collections and deductions specified in this section,
regardless of the fact that the services on account of which any particular
deduction is required as to residents of the Village were performed at the
place of business of any such employer situated outside the Village.
   (c)    The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the tax on the
compensation received.
   (d)    Commissions and fees paid to professional men, brokers and others who
are independent contractors and not employees of the payor, are not subject to
withholding or collection of the tax at the source. Such taxpayers must, in all
instances, file returns and pay the tax pursuant to the provisions of Sections
183.03 or
181.03. (See Sections
183.05 and
 183.06).
   (e)    In the case of employees who are nonresidents of Middleport the
amount to be deducted is one percent (1%) of the compensation paid with respect
to personal services rendered in Middleport.
   Where a nonresident receives compensation for personal services rendered or
performed partly within and partly outside Middleport, the withholding employer
shall deduct, withhold and remit that portion of the compensation which is
earned within Middleport in accordance with the following rules of
apportionment.
      (1)    If the nonresident is a salesman, agent or other employee whose
compensation on the basis of commission depends directly on the volume of
business transacted by him, the deducting and withholding shall attach to the
portion of the entire compensation which the volume or business transacted by
the employee within the Village bears to the volume of business transacted by
him within and outside the Village.
      (2)    The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation of
all other employees (including officers of corporations) shall attach to the
portion of the personal service compensation of such employee which the total
number of working days employed within the Village bears to the total number of
working days employed within and outside the Village.
      (3)    If it is impossible to apportion the earnings as provided above,
because of the peculiar nature of the service of the employee, or the unusual
basis of compensation, apportionment shall be made in accordance with the facts
and the tax deducted and withheld accordingly.
      (4)    The occasional entry into the Village of a nonresident employee
who performs the duties for which he is employed entirely outside the Village,
but enters the Village for the purpose of reporting, receiving instructions,
accounting, etc., incidental to his duties outside the Village, shall not be
deemed to take such employees out of the class of those rendering their
services entirely outside the Village.
   (f)    An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any advances
made to an employee on account of commissions (whether by way of drawing
account or otherwise - but see subsection (g) hereof) where such advances are
in excess of commissions earned.
   (g)    An employer required to withhold the tax in compensation paid to an
employee shall in determining the amount on which the tax is to be withheld,
ignore any amount allowed and paid by the employer to the employee for expenses
necessary and actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of
his services. Provided, that such expenses must be of the kind and in the
amount recognized and allowed as deductible expenses for Federal income tax
purposes.
(Ord. 1195-88.  Passed 4-11-88.)
183.15  RETURNS OF TAX WITHHELD AND PAYMENT.
   (a)    The deduction from salaries, wages, and other compensation required
to be made by employers is to begin with compensation earned on and after July
1, 1988.  The first return and payment required to be made on account of such
deductions shall be made, filed and paid to the Village Tax Administrator by
August 31, 1988.
   (b)    Each employer within the Village who employs one or more persons on a
salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis shall deduct monthly or
more often than monthly and at the time of the payment of such salary, wage,
commission or other compensation, the tax of one percent (1%) of salaries,
wages, commissions or other compensation due by the employer to the employee.
   (c)    Every employer required to deduct and withhold any amount under this
section shall file a return thereof and shall pay that amount as required
herein as follows:
   In monthly payments to be made not later than thirty days following the
close of the calendar month during which the amount was withheld.
   (d)    Such return shall be on a form prescribed by and obtained from the
Village Tax Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations
prescribed therefor by the Village Tax Administrator. Such employer, in
collecting the tax, shall be deemed to hold same until payment is made by such
employer to the Village as such for the benefit of the Village and any such tax
collected by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid to
the Village, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   (e)    For adjustment of errors in returns of tax withheld by employers, see
Section
183.23.  (Ord. 1195-88.  Passed 4-11-88.)
183.16  LIMITATION ON CREDIT FOR TAX PAID AT SOURCE.
   The failure of any employer, residing either within or outside the Village
to collect the tax and to make any return prescribed herein, shall not relieve
the employee from the payment of such tax in compliance with these regulations
respecting the making of returns and the payment of taxes. (Ord. 1195-88.
Passed 4-11-88.)
183.17  STATUS AND LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS.
   (a)    Every employer is deemed to be a trustee of the Village in collecting
and holding the tax required to be withheld, and the funds so collected by such
withholding are deemed to be trust funds.
   (b)    Every such employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the
source is liable directly to the Village for the payment of such tax, whether
actually collected by such employer or not. (Ord. 1195-88. Passed 4-11-88.)
183.18  DECLARATIONS.
   (a)    An employee whose entire wages, salaries and other compensation for
any taxable year will be subjected to the withholding provisions under Section
183.15 through
183.17 whose tax will accordingly be withheld as to his entire earnings for
such year by his employer, and who during such taxable year expects to derive
no other compensation, or other income which is subject to tax under this
chapter, need not file a declaration as provided in this section.
   (b)    All other taxpayers (as defined in this chapter) subject to the taxes
imposed in Section
181.03, and every taxpayer who anticipates any income or net profits not
subject to total withholding as provided in the preceding paragraph, shall file
with the Village Tax Administrator a declaration of his estimated tax as
follows:
      (1)    On or before August 31, 1988, every such taxpayer shall file a
declaration of his estimated tax for the taxable period beginning July 1, 1988,
and ending December 31, 1988.
      (2)    A similar declaration shall be filed by each such taxpayer on or
before the thirtieth day of April of each subsequent year during the life of
the chapter, and each such declaration shall contain a statement of the
taxpayer's estimated tax for the full taxable year in which such declaration is
filed.
      (3)    Taxpayers who or which are permitted pursuant to the provisions of
Section
183.10 to return and pay their tax upon fiscal year basis shall file their
first declaration within four months after the beginning of the first fiscal
year beginning after January 1, 1988, and the subsequent declaration for each
year thereafter on or before the thirtieth day of the fourth month following
the beginning of each such fiscal year.
      (4)    The estimated tax may be paid in full with the declaration or in
equal installments on or before April 30, June 30, September 30 and December
31, the first filing being as of September 30, 1988. Those taxpayers on a
fiscal year basis shall make quarterly payments on or before the thirtieth day
of the fourth month and on or before the last day of the sixth, ninth and
twelfth month following the beginning of such fiscal year. The first
installment, equal to at least one-fourth, must accompany the declaration.
      (5)    The declarations so required shall be filed upon a form furnished
by or obtainable from the Village Tax Administrator. Any taxpayer who has filed
an estimate for Federal income tax purposes may, in making the declaration
required hereunder, simply state therein that the figures therein contained are
the same figures used by the taxpayer in making the declaration of his estimate
for the Federal income tax. However, in addition to such statement, any such
taxpayer may, in such declaration modify and adjust such declared income so as
to exclude therefrom income which is not subject to tax under the chapter.
      (6)    Any estimate filed hereunder may be amended by the filing of an
amended estimate at the time prescribed for the payment of any installment of
tax paid in accordance with Section
183.19.
         (Ord. 1195-88.  Passed 4-11-88.)
183.19  PAYMENT OF TAX INSTALLMENTS.
   (a)    At the time of filing each declaration (required by Section
183.18) each taxpayer shall pay to the Village one-fourth of the amount of his
estimated annual tax. Thereafter, on or before the thirtieth day of April,
June, September and December of each year during the life of the chapter, such
taxpayer shall pay at least a similar amount.  However, if any such taxpayer
shall, on or before any such payment date, file an amended declaration showing
an increase or decrease of an estimated tax, the installments then and
thereafter due shall be increased or diminished (as the case may be) in such
manner that the balance of the estimated tax shall be fully paid on or before
December 31, of the taxable year involved through the payment of quarterly
installments in equal amounts during the quarterly periods remaining from and
after the filing of any such amended declaration.
   (b)    Taxpayers who or which are permitted to make returns and pay their
tax on a fiscal year basis (see Section
183.10) may make the quarterly payments on their declaration of estimated tax
pursuant to Section
183.18(b)(3) and (4).

183.13.
(Ord. 1195-88.  Passed 4-11-88.)
183.20  RECIPROCITY.
   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Village but receives net
profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service compensation
for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the Village, if it
be made to appear that he has paid a municipal income tax on such net profits,
salary, wages, commission or other compensation to another municipality, shall
be allowed a credit on the tax imposed by the chapter of the amount so paid by
him or in his behalf to the other municipality.  The credit shall not exceed
the tax assessed by this chapter on such net profits, salary, wages, commission
or compensation earned in such other municipality or municipalities where such
City income tax is paid.
(Ord. 1195-88. Passed 4-11-88.)
183.21  INQUISITORIAL POWERS OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (a)    The Tax Administrator personally, or his agents are authorized and
empowered to examine the books, papers and records of any employer or supposed
employer, or of any taxpayer, or supposed taxpayer, in order to verify the
accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
imposed by this chapter.
   (b)    Every employer or supposed employer, and every taxpayer or supposed
taxpayer is required to furnish to the Tax Administrator or his duly authorized
agents or employees, the means, facilities and opportunity for such
examinations, investigations and audits as are authorized in and by this
chapter.
   (c)    The Tax Administrator or his duly authorized agent or employee is
further authorized and empowered to examine under oath any person concerning
any income which was or should have been returned for taxation, and to this
end, the Clerk- Treasurer has the right and power to compel the production of
books, papers and records and the attendance of all persons before him whether
as parties or witnesses, whom he believes to have knowledge of such income.
   (d)    Refusal of any examination by any employer or person subject to the
tax, or presumed to be such employer or person so subject, constitutes a
misdemeanor punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both.
(Ord. 1195-88.  Passed 4-11-88.)
183.22  RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY EMPLOYERS AND TAXPAYERS.
   Employers and others subject to the tax under this chapter are required to
keep such records as will enable the filing of true and accurate returns,
whether for taxes withheld at source or if taxes payable upon earnings or net
profits, or both, and such records are to be preserved to enable the Village
Clerk or any agent or employee of the Tax Administrator, to verify the
correctness of the returns filed.
(Ord. 1195-88. Passed 4-11-88.)
183.23  COLLECTION OF DEFICIENCIES; ALLOWANCE OF CREDIT FOR OVERPAYMENT.
   (a)    If, as a result of investigation conducted by the Tax Administrator a
return is found to be incorrect, the Tax Administrator is authorized to assess
and collect any underpayment of tax withheld at source or any underpayment of
tax owing by any taxpayer with respect to earnings or net profits, or both, if
no return has been filed and a tax is found to be owing. The tax actually owing
may be assessed and collected with or without the formality of obtaining a
delinquent return from the employer or taxpayer.
   (b)    Should it be disclosed, either as a result of an investigation by the
Tax Administrator or through the medium of the filing of a claim or petition
for refund or credit that an overpayment has been made, the Clerk-Treasurer
will refund such overpayment.
   (c)    The employer will, in every instance, be required to pay the full tax
which should have been withheld, even though he may fail to withhold from the
employee. If too much has been withheld, the excess shall be refunded by the
employer to the employee.
While the withholding agent (employer) will be elected to maintain complete
records of such adjustments with the employees, any such adjustment made during
any month will not need to be reflected in the withholding return or disclosed
by schedules or statements thereto attached.
   (d)    In those cases in which too much has been withheld by an employer
from an employee and remitted to the Village and there has been a termination
of the employee- employer relationship, the taxpayer (employee) may obtain an
adjustment by application to the Village. (Ord. 1195-88.  Passed 4-11-88.)
183.24  PENALTY FOR DIVULGING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Tax returns, and all audits connected therewith are confidential. Any
information gained by the Clerk-Treasurer, by his agents or employees, or by
any other official or agent of the Village as a result of any returns,
investigations, hearings or verifications required or authorized by this
chapter shall be held confidential, except for official purposes and except in
accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law.
Violation of this provision constitutes a misdemeanor, punishable by fine not
exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisonment for not more than six
months, or both. Every such breach of confidence constitutes a separate
offense.

by employers under the provisions of this chapter and remaining unpaid after
they become due shall bear interest at the rate of one-half percent (½%) per
month or fraction thereof.
   (b)    In addition to interest as provided in subsection (a) hereof,

by the Administrator when a return has been filed in good faith and the tax
paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Administrator, and provided
further that, in the absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be
assessed on any additional tax assessment resulting from a Federal audit,
providing an amended return is filed and the additional tax is paid within
three months after final determination of the Federal tax liability.
   
   (d)    Upon recommendation of the Administrator, the Board of Review may
abate penalty or interest, or both, or upon an appeal from the refusal of the
Administrator to recommend abatement of penalty or interest, the Board may,
nevertheless, abate penalty or interest, or both.  (Ord. 1195-88.  Passed 4-11-
88.)
183.26  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES.

income subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, an additional
assessment shall not be made after three years from the time the return was due
or filed, whichever is later, provided, however, in those cases in which a
Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the
Federal statute of limitation, the period within which an additional assessment
may be made by the Administrator shall be one year from the time of the final
determination of the Federal tax liability.

finds net profits are not properly allocated to the Village by reason of
transaction with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he

on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation
from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. 
This is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
 185.02 (C)(16)).
   (B)     For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (C)     For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal

               (c)   (i)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate
for the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the Village
with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of
which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
          (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Village for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
          (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the

          (1)    Except as otherwise provided in division (F)(2) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and

cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
                 (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for
services performed in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation

185.04 (C);
                 (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from
sales and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the

period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
          (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)

portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
                 (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment
method shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed
appeal of an assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may
use the requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the
request in an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
185.12 (A).
                 (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
 185.12 (A).
                 (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
          (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages,

investigation, inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative,
judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that
the compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the
employer or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly
benefits the employer;
                 (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines
that the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

which the tangible personal property is used in the Village.
          (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the
rental of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded
entity owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village's tax only if
the property generating the net profit is located in the Village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the Village.

estate everywhere in the taxable year.

earned and/or received by each employee in the Village.  Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
185.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
 185.03 of this chapter, of 1%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other

the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively

withheld on behalf of the Village in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.
Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made so that the
payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the

Revenue Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation,
the payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator
of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village. The payment of tax
by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
          (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make
and file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by  Tax Administrator and the Village as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this chapter/ordinance is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
          (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not
required to withhold the Village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
          (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by
the failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold
the tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
                 (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer to remit to the Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
          (6)     Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
the Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
          (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required
to withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
          (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an
employer shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax

employee, the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the

Administrator.
          (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
          (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
          (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of
this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
               (d)    "Professional athlete" means an athlete who performs
services in a professional athletic event for wages or other remuneration.
                 (e)    "Professional entertainer" means a person who performs
services in the professional performing arts for wages or other remuneration on
a per-event basis.
                 (f)    "Public figure" means a person of prominence who
performs services at discrete events, such as speeches, public appearances, or
similar events, for wages or other remuneration on a per-event basis.     
                 (g)    "Worksite location" means a construction site or other
temporary worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for
more than 20 days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not
include the home of an employee.
      (2)   (a)    Subject to divisions (C)(3), (5), (6), and (7) of this
section, an employer is not required to withhold the Village income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the Village if the employee performed such services in the Village on 20 or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
Village.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the Village. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
Village at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
                     (b)    The agreement between the employer and its customer
to perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services
at the location for more than 20 days.
            (iii)    The employee is a resident of the Village and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section 185.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in the Village than in any other municipal corporation
on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee
spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the
following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's
principal place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)    Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order

that has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            (iv)    Transporting or delivering property described in division
(C)(2)(b)(iii) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property,
the employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real
estate owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's
employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
          (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this
section, if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends
performing personal services in the Village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Village for any subsequent days in
that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in the Village.
                 (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the
Village under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
the Village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages
to the employee for personal services performed in the Village.
          (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the Village and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
185.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the Village.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
          (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
185.04.
         (Ord. 100-15.  Passed 11-9-15.)
185.05  ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual Village income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every individual taxpayer and any taxpayer that is not an individual for each
taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the tax, whether or not a tax
is due thereon. 
          (1)     The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
185.04 when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the
tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, and no additional tax is due the Village.
          (2)     Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for the Village
income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. 
The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from
which retired.  The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Village, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Village, the return or notice required of that individual shall
be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (E)    The Village shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer.  The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
            (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to
support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who
files the annual return required by this section electronically is not required
to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
              (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not
an individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net
profit return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of
only the following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form
1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and,
with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any other
documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments made
in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
            (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator
may request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to the Village.  No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
                   (b)     Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
annual net profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day (15th) of the fourth month
following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year.  The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Village.  No
remittance is required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
          (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village's income tax
return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax return shall be the
15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
                 (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be
included with the filing of the Village's income tax return.
                 (b)     A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-
month extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit
a written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's the Village income tax return. 
If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
Village income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
          (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
Village's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village's income tax
return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax
return.
          (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Village, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
          (5)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
            (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Village an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section.
   (I)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. This division shall not
apply to payments required to be made under division (B)(1)(a) of Section
185.04 or provisions for semi-monthly withholding.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the Village by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section 185.04 shall be allowed to the
taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the taxpayer by the
Village, unless the amounts withheld were not remitted to the Village and the
recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with
the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Village to be filed in accordance with
this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village, provided that
the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the
Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return
preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this
chapter and of the Village's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations
governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the
Village's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
            (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may
report the amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and
may make remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
          (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing
employer withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the Village
for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time
for payment of taxes required by the Village during the period of the member's
or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.  However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. 
          (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the Village before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
            (3)     Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1)
of this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period. 
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
          (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the Village in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
                 (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with
division (P)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
          (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group
as defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
            (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a
consolidated return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section
1501 of the Internal Revenue Code.

taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
          (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
          (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown. 
          (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal
income tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following
the last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
          (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section
is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated the Village income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Village. A taxpayer that is required to file a
consolidated the Village income tax return for a taxable year shall file a
consolidated the Village income tax return for all subsequent taxable years,
unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the Tax
Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a change
in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated the Village income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States department of

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
185.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
          (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated the Village income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
185.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
          (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated the Village income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
185.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
185.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall
not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's
net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
          (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
 185.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated the Village income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
185.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated the Village income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the Village in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 100-15.  Passed 11-9-15.)
185.06   CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)    Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Village who is required to
and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality.  Subject to division (C) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due the Village under this chapter. 
   (B)     The Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Village who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it grants
a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation.
   (C)     If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality. 
   (D)     Intentionally left blank.
(Ord. 100-15.  Passed 11-9-15.)
185.07  ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
          (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer
reasonably estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the Village's
income tax for the current taxable year.
          (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the Village for
the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled,
and after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit
from another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Village in equal amounts on each payment date unless
the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld,
in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the
amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
          (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before
the date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under
division (G) of Section
185.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
          (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
          (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of
the taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
185.05.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
185.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
          (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
          (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
one hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the Village under Section
185.05 for that year.
          (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 100-15.  Passed 11-9-15.)
185.08  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.  (Ord. 100-15.  Passed 11-9-15.)
185.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
185.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the Village:
          (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
          (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten
dollars or more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
          (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
          (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
185.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
          (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the
earliest postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed
is not later than the last day for filing the request.
          (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within seven days of such last
day.
          (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark
date was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of
the postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within
seven days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
 185.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 100-15.  Passed 11-9-15.)
185.10   SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Village, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the Village as a
refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village is subject to recovery by the Village.  If
the Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a
refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the Village
shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the Village
claims is due with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the first municipality with respect to such income or
wages. 
   (C)    If the Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village's tax rate.  However, if the Village's tax rate is greater than the tax
rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to the Village, along with any penalty and interest that
accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.   
(Ord. 100-15. Passed 11-9-15.)
185.11   AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
185.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
            (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of
tax that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Village. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
 185.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's the Village's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended the Village return showing income
subject to the Village income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional the
Village income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars.  (Ord.
100-15. Passed 11-9-15.)
185.12   LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
                (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later; or
                (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying
deferral period, if any.
                 (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this
section may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the
employer, agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to
the extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the
time limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
                   (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
185.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
                (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on
which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if
any party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of
Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
185.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
          (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
 185.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
185.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover the Village income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 100-15.  Passed 11-9-15.)
185.13   AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.  (Ord. 100-
15.  Passed 11-9-15.)
185.14   SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
                   (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other the Village
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
          (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by
certified mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address,
the Tax Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The
assessment shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and
include the following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other the Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 100-15.  Passed 11-9-15.)
185.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village that arises pursuant to the Village's income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the Village:
          (1)    Compromise a claim;
          (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim
by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.  (Ord. 100-15.  Passed 11-9-15.)
185.16   TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter/
ordinance and other related tax information to the internal revenue service,
the tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 100-15.  Passed 11-9-15.)
185.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village ordinance or state law
to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or
advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of
the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Village or the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 100-15.  Passed 11-9-15.)
185.18   INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
          (1)    "Applicable law" means this chapter, the resolutions,
ordinances, codes, directives, instructions, and rules adopted by the Village

185.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF  INFORMATION.

   (A)    Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax

            (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the
manner authorized by law;
            (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized

subject to, the provisions of this chapter/ordinance shall be open to the Tax

period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that

show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the Village or for the withholding of such tax.
            (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that
the Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income
that was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
            (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
            (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for
identifying information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid
identifying information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this
chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person
to whom the request was directed pursuant to Section
185.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
185.99.
                (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
185.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter/ordinance prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
185.18.
                (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and
(b) of this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or
fee with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in
addition to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
185.99 for a violation of Section
 185.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.  (Ord. 100-15.  Passed 11-9-15.)

transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.  Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.  (Ord. 100-15.  Passed 11-9-15.)

   (A)   (1)    The Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Village, but
such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Village at any time during their term or in the five years (which applies
only to these two appointments) immediately preceding the date of appointment.
One member shall be appointed by the Mayor of the Village. This member may be
an employee of the Village, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate

            (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review the Village
shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of terms that a member may

member appointed by the Mayor of the Village shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
            (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the
legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority
vote for malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a
member, the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges
against the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in

notice. The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and

hold office for the remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax
Review shall impair the power and authority of the remaining members to
exercise all the powers of the Board of Tax Review.

Tax Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason,
the legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the
member shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of
Tax Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall
be subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the

within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax

rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.

lienholder of a vehicle that has been removed under this section, subject to
subsection (c) of this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with

the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC

   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.

on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty. 
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.  Whoever violates
subsection (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while
under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of
a controlled substance.  The court shall sentence the offender for either
offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider
whether the evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.
   (g)   Points shall be assessed for violation of a limitation under
subsection (d) hereof in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
   (h)   Whenever, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or this section, the

335.01  DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor.  When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the

fifteen years of age and who is not otherwise required by subsection (a), (b)
or (c) hereof to be secured in a child restraint system or booster seat, is
being transported in a motor vehicle, other than a taxicab or public safety
vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4511.01, that is required by the United States
Department of Transportation to be equipped with seat belts at the time of
manufacture or assembly, the operator of the motor vehicle shall have the child
properly restrained either in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions
in a child restraint system that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards
or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not
be used for the purpose of determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or
(d) of this section has been or is being committed.
   (f)   The Ohio Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are
necessary to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or an occupant restraining device as
required by this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the
motor vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
   (h)   This section does not apply when an emergency exists that threatens
the life of any person operating or occupying a motor vehicle that is being
used to transport a child who otherwise would be required to be restrained
under this section.  This section does not apply to a person operating a motor
vehicle who has an affidavit signed by a physician licensed to practice in this
State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4731 or a chiropractor licensed to practice in
this State under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4734 that states that the child who
otherwise would be required to be restrained under this section has a physical
impairment that makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).
      (2)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty
to a violation of subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a state
law or municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to any of those
subsections, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which

have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)

501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.   
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."

      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or

repealed.  See Ohio R.C. 2981.01 et seq. for current regulations.)
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.   Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                            Maximum Fine
First degree                                   $5000.00

      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available

offender under this section to pay the costs of tests performed on a substance
if the results of the tests do not indicate that the substance tested contained

defense; and any such removal shall be final.

515.08  PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
360 days of the alleged violation with the Board a complaint in writing, sworn
to or affirmed, which shall state the name and address of the person alleged to
have committed the violation complained of and the particulars thereof, and
such other information as may be required by the Board.  The Board may also
corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of testing carried out by its
staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)   Upon the filing of a complaint the executive secretary of the Board
shall make such investigation as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and
issues.  If the executive secretary determines that there are reasonable
grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the
matter by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all interested
parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to assist them. 
Conciliation conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during such
initial conferences shall be made public by the Board or any member of the
Board or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)   The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced to
writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the parties,
which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an
admission by any party that the law has been violated.  Consent agreements
shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (d)   The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Board or Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation under
this chapter.
   (e)   If the executive secretary determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so
inform the Board and the Board may in its discretion dismiss such complaint or
order such further investigation as may be necessary, provided that the Board
shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording the complainant an
opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (f)   If the executive secretary with respect to a matter which involves a
violation of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible to conciliation, he shall notify the Board

respect to prohibited fences under Section
521.07.  The person seeking a variance and the Planning and Zoning Commission

to the application of the Village Zoning Ordinance, including no such variance
shall be authorized unless a finding is made that all of the following facts

         A.   Exceptional and extraordinary circumstances or conditions that
apply to the subject property that do not apply generally to other properties
in the same district or vicinity.

         D.   The authorization of such variance shall not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the district or
vicinity in which the property is located.

property lines and to ascertain that the fence thus constructed does not
deviate from the plans as approved by the Building Inspector issuing permits,
and such fence does not encroach upon another lot or parcel of land.  The
Village shall furnish such inspection as is deemed necessary to determine that
such fence is constructed in accordance with plans submitted for permit,
provided however, that the issuance of such permit by the Village shall not be
construed to mean the Village has determined such fence is not encroaching upon
another lot, nor shall it relieve the property owner of the duty imposed upon
him herein.
   (m)   Penalty.  Whoever violates any provision of this chapter shall be
guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one hundred
dollars ($100.00).  Each day that such violation continues shall constitute a

property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as

   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the

Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle that the actor transported or
had the firearm in the motor vehicle for any lawful purpose and while the motor
vehicle was on the actor’s own property, provided that the affirmative defense
is not available unless the person, immediately prior to arriving at the
actor’s own property, did not transport or possess the firearm in a motor
vehicle in a manner prohibited by subsection (a) while the motor vehicle was
being operated on a street, highway, or other public or private property used
by the public for vehicular traffic.
   (e)   (1)   No person who is charged with a violation of subsection (a)
shall be required to obtain a concealed handgun license as a condition for the
dismissal of the charge.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of, was convicted of, pleads guilty to, or
has pleaded guilty to a violation of subsection (b) of this section as it
existed prior to  September 30, 2011, and if the conduct that was the basis of
the violation no longer would be a violation of subsection (b) of this section
on or after September 30, 2011, the person may file an application under Ohio
R.C. 2953.37 requesting the expungement of the record of conviction.
   If a person is convicted of, was convicted of, pleads guilty to, or has
pleaded guilty to a violation of subsection (a) of this section as the
subsection existed prior to September 30, 2011, and if the conduct that was the
basis of the violation no longer would be a violation of subsection (a) of this
section on or after September 30, 2011, due to the application of subsection
(b)(4) of this section as it exists on and after September 30, 2011, the person
may file an application under Ohio R.C. 2953.37 requesting the expungement of
the record of conviction.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of improperly handling
firearms in a motor vehicle.  Violation of subsection (a) of this section is a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  Except as otherwise provided in this

misdemeanor of the first degree, and, in addition to any other penalty or
sanction imposed for the violation, the offender’s concealed handgun license
shall be suspended pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2923.128(A)(2).  If at the time of the
stop of the offender for a traffic stop, for another law enforcement purpose,
or for a purpose defined in Ohio R.C. 5503.34 that was the basis of the
violation any law enforcement officer involved with the stop or the employee of
the motor carrier enforcement unit who made the stop had actual knowledge of
the offender’s status as a licensee, a violation of subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2)
of this section is a minor misdemeanor, and the offender’s concealed handgun
license shall not be suspended pursuant to division (A)(2) of Ohio R.C.
2923.128.  A violation of subsection (b)(3) or (4) of this section is a
misdemeanor of the first degree or, if the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of subsection (b)(3) or (4) of
this section, a felony and shall be prosecuted under appropriate State law.  In
addition to any other penalty or sanction imposed for a misdemeanor violation
of subsection (b)(3) or (4) of this section, the offender’s concealed handgun
license shall be suspended pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2923.128(A)(2).
   (g)   If a law enforcement officer stops a motor vehicle for a traffic stop
or any other purpose, if any person in the motor vehicle surrenders a firearm
to the officer, either voluntarily or pursuant to a request or demand of the
officer, and if the officer does not charge the person with a violation of this
section or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise
prohibited by law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not
contraband, the officer shall return the firearm to the person at the
termination of the stop.  If a court orders a law enforcement officer to return
a firearm to a person pursuant to the requirement set forth in this subsection,
division (B) of Ohio R.C. 2923.163 applies.

the same compartment, the magazine or speed loader is contained within a
separate enclosure in that compartment that does not contain the firearm and
that closes using a snap, button, buckle, zipper, hook and loop closing
mechanism, or other fastener that must be opened to access the contents or the
firearm is contained within a separate enclosure of that nature in that
compartment that does not contain the magazine or speed loader;
               b.   A pocket or other enclosure on the person of the person in

being transported as described in that subsection, as long as no ammunition is
in a firearm, other than a handgun, in the vehicle other than as permitted
under any other provision of this chapter or Ohio R.C. Chapter 2923.  A person
who is carrying a valid concealed handgun license may have one or more

handgun, in the vehicle other than as permitted under any provision of this

issuance of the license, information covering the particular vehicle to be
licensed, including the make and the State license number of the vehicle, the
length of time the vehicle has been in use, the motor number and/or the serial

addition to the fee required for motor vehicle licenses under the laws of the
State.
717.05  TAXICAB LICENSE ISSUANCE.
   (a)    The Mayor shall investigate and if necessary, hold a hearing for each
applicant for a license. If the Mayor finds from such investigation and hearing
that the provisions of this chapter and the Ohio Revised Code have been met
(i.e., that the applicant is the owner of the vehicle for which a license is
desired; that such vehicle is safe and fit for conveyance of the public and
that the vehicle and the applicant both comply with all requirements of this
chapter and relevant portions of the Ohio Revised Code) then the Mayor shall
notify the applicant of the Mayor's findings, and the license shall be issued.
   (b)    If the Mayor finds that the applicant at that time has not complied
with the requirements of this chapter, the Mayor may require the applicant to
furnish, within thirty days, any additional relevant information required.  If
the Mayor then finds that the applicant is the owner of the vehicle for which a
license is desired, that such vehicle is safe and fit for the public's
conveyance and that the vehicle and the applicant both comply with all the
requirements of this chapter and relevant portions of the Ohio Revised Code,
then the Mayor shall so notify the applicant and the Mayor shall issue a
license to the applicant upon the payment of the proper license fee.
717.06  WINDSHIELD STICKER.
   At the time the license is issued by the Mayor to the owner of the taxicab,
the Mayor shall also issue to such owner a windshield sticker showing the
Village license number and the year for which such license is issued. Such

the Mayor and no person shall remove or transfer the same during the year for
which it is issued.
717.07  LIABILITY INSURANCE REQUIRED.
   No license to operate any taxicab shall be issued or renewed by the Mayor
and no person shall operate such taxicab unless and until the owner of the same
deposits and maintains with the Mayor a policy of an insurance company duly
licensed to transact business in this State. The insurance policy shall insure,
within the amounts specified in such policy, the owner of such taxicab and also
any other person (herein called the operator) operating the same in the Village
as a taxicab under the authority of such owner whether such authority is the
owner or the owner's assignee or lessee and such person operating such car,
against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages on account of bodily
injury or death and/or for damage to property (other the injury, death or
property damage of the insured or insured's employees) resulting from such
ownership, maintenance or use of such taxicab. The insurance policy shall also
contain language obligating the insurer to pay to any judgment creditor, to the
extent of the respective amounts as specified in such policy, and to pay any
final judgment rendered against the insured or such operator by reason of such
liability. At the time of the deposit of such policy, the applicant shall
furnish to the Mayor the dates and numbers of the last licenses issued to such
company to transact business in the State. In addition, such policy of
insurance shall contain an endorsement providing that the policy is in full
force and effect and binding upon the insurance company until the date
specified for its expiration or until such insurance company has given the
Mayor twenty days notice in writing of such company's intent to cancel such
policy.
717.08  EXTENT Of LIABILITY.
   (a)    The limit in any such insurance policy of the liability of the
insurer on account of the ownership, maintenance and use of each taxicab shall
be not less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for bodily injury to
or death of one person and, subject to such limit as to the injury or death of
one person, three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) on account of anyone
accident resulting in injury to and/or death of more than one person and fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000) on account of damage to property in any one
accident. However, it shall be permissible for the insurance coverage upon the
operation of any one taxicab to be subject to a deduction of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) upon any one claim for liability or property damage, provided
that this shall not in any way affect or abridge the liability of any person
owning, leasing or in any way concerned with the operations of any taxicab.
   (b)    Any such insurance policy shall be subject to the approval of legal
counsel selected by Council as to its form and compliance with this provision.
717.09  CANCELLATION OF POLICY BY INSURER.
   The insurance policy may provide for cancellation by the insurer upon
written notice to the Mayor. Upon such cancellation, the taxicab license
covered by this policy shall be revoked by the Mayor unless a new policy is
written and received by the Mayor's office before cancellation takes effect.
However, this provision shall not be construed to waive any lawful notice which
the insurer must give to the insured. In case a license is revoked, the Mayor
may, upon the filing of a new policy of insurance, reinstate such license,
provided that such reinstatement is done within ten days from such revocation
and the payment of a fee of ten dollars ($10.00) is made therefor.
717.10  TAXICAB LICENSE REVOCATION.
   (a)    Nonpayment of Judgment.  In the event of a final judgment or award by
a court of record against the owner of a taxicab, for damages on account of
bodily injury or death and/or for damage to property, if such judgment or award
is not paid within thirty days thereafter, the Mayor shall forthwith revoke all
licenses of all the taxicabs of such owner.
   (b)    Failure to Operate.  Whenever any person holding one or more licenses
for taxicabs fails to make a reasonable and consistent effort to operate any
such licensed taxicab for a period of sixty days, the Mayor shall notify the
holder of the license and the Mayor shall revoke the license for such taxicab. 
However, any such person who desires to discontinue the services of such
taxicab or taxicabs for a short period of time, may do so for a period of not
less than sixty days or more than 120 days by so notifying the Mayor and
depositing with the Mayor the licenses for such taxicab or taxicabs. However,
if such taxicab or taxicabs so discontinued from service are not placed in
service at the expiration of such 120-day period, such license or licenses
therefor shall be revoked.
717.11  TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   (a)    Vehicle to Vehicle.  In the event that the owner of a licensed
taxicab ceases to own the same or in the event that such vehicle becomes
unsuitable for operation, an affidavit to such effect may be filed with the
Mayor who shall thereupon transfer the license to any other vehicle belonging
to such owner, provided that such vehicle is approved by the Mayor and the
provisions of this chapter and relevant provisions of the Ohio Revised Code
have been satisfied.
   (b)    Owner to Owner.  No taxicab license shall be transferred from one
owner to another.
717.12  IDENTIFICATION, PAINTING AND LETTERING.
   Every person owning and operating a taxicab under a license from the Village
may adopt a trade name, design, color scheme or method of painting or lettering
such taxicab that is approved by the Mayor. Such trade name, design, color
scheme or method of painting or lettering shall meet the following
requirements:
   (a)    A serial body number may be painted on each side and on the rear of
the taxicab.
   (b)    The name of the owner or the trade name under which the owner does
business may be painted on each side of each taxicab.  Whenever the name of the
owner or trade name under which the owner does business does not include any of
the words "taxicab", "taxi" or "cab", then the word "taxicab" may be painted on
each side of the taxicab immediately beneath such name or trade name.
717.13  TAXICAB REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Every taxicab shall be kept in a safe and sanitary operating
condition and shall at all times have all safety equipment required of such
vehicles by the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)    No taxicab shall be licensed until it has been thoroughly and
carefully inspected and found to be in a thoroughly safe condition for the
transportation of passengers. The Mayor shall make or have made by an inspector
or police officer under the Mayor's direction an inspection of licensed
taxicabs at intervals of not more than ninety days after the issuance of the
license. The Mayor may refuse a license to or, if one is already issued, revoke
or suspend the license of, any taxicab found by the Mayor to be unfit or
unsuitable for public patronage. The Mayor is hereby authorized to establish
reasonable rules and regulations for the inspection of taxicabs, their
appurtenances, construction and condition of fitness.
717.14  CARRYING CAPACITY.
   No taxicab shall carry more passengers than such vehicle was designed to

vehicle concerned and for all other vehicles owned by the same owner.
717.16  RECORDS.
   The owner or person in charge of one or more taxicabs shall keep a record of

record shall be subject to inspection at all times by the public and shall not
be destroyed for a period of three years.
717.17  USE OF NONLICENSED VEHICLES.
   No person shall use any vehicle, other than a taxicab duly licensed under
and operating in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, for
transporting the public generally, as passengers for hire, reward, gift,
donation or other consideration. In the case of a violation of this section,
the violator shall not thereafter be granted a license for a vehicle concerned

subsequent violation. However, this section shall not apply to motor buses or
omnibuses operating under proper authority.

into the Village, but may not pick up any passengers from any destination or
accept any business within the Village except upon compliance with the terms
and provisions of this chapter.
717.19  FAILURE TO PAY FARE.
   No person shall engage any taxicab with intent to defraud the owner or
driver thereof. Refusal to pay the lawful charge for such vehicle or leaving
the same without payment or offer to pay shall be prima facie evidence of such
intent to defraud.

meter seal has been broken or any bypass inserted and there is evidence that
the meter has been tampered with, the water shall be shut off and shall not be
turned on again until the consumer or owner of the premises shall pay for the
estimated quantity of water which has been used and/or registered, and in
addition, thereto a fee of $70.00 for turning on said water.  The criminal laws
of the State of Ohio provide severe penalties for the tampering with water
meters, meter seals, etc.
The penalties herein above are in addition to the penalties provided by the
criminal laws of the State of Ohio and by the payment herein above will not in
any way relieve any person from criminal prosecution.
Rule 7.  No person shall operate, open or otherwise tamper with any valve,
stopcock or other device, after same shall have been closed for violation of
any rule or regulation of the Village of Middleport, or unlawfully secure a
supply of water through such valve, stopcock, curbcock or other device after

Rule 9.  Every water service must be equipped with a meter, which will be
provided by the Village of Middleport.  No meter smaller than 5/8" by ¾" shall
be installed in a new building or residence.
Rule 10.  Any persons, firm, corporations who is the owner of the property to
be served desiring water service must complete and sign an application at the
Village of Middleport's Clerk's Office before water service will be provided. 
The Village of Middleport shall require the owner of the real property to sign
the application for water service, if the property to be serviced is a rental
property/not owner occupied.  Service may be refused to an applicant or premise
owing for previous service; however, service shall not be denied to an
applicant based upon another customer's bill.
   
Rule 11.  Meter Reading will be taken monthly if possible, usually within the
first seven days of the month.  Meters must be installed in such manner and
place that will make them readily accessible for reading.  If the meter reader
is unable to obtain a reading, an estimated charge will be based on previous
readings or similar services of the same use of water.
Rule 12.  Any person, firm, contractor, or corporation, in person or by agent
desiring a water connection shall make application for a permit for such
connection at the office of the Clerk.  There shall be but one house, trailer,
or building on each meter.  There may be more than one meter for each
building.  Each meter constitutes a separate service.  If a house contains more
than one family unit and the owner of said units does not wish to separate the
water system in said house so each unit can be separately metered, then the
person who made application for the water service as provided in rule 10 of
these By-Laws shall pay the total monthly charges as established.
If a building contains more than one business and/or apartments and the owner
of said units do not wish to separate the water system in said building so each
business or apartment can be separately metered then the person who made the

the total monthly charges for water as established.
Rule 13.  Any appropriate person, firm, corporation, or water user, may
discontinue water service by proper notice to the office of the Clerk and be
relieved of their responsibility when the water is turned off at the curb box
and the account cleared on the records of the Clerk.
Rule 14.  Each trailer used as residence or business shall be a separate
service and require a tap and meter installation.
Rule 15.  Inspectors, meter readers or employees of the Middleport Public
Works, whose duty it may be to enter upon private premises to examine meters,

of Middleport may deem necessary to identify them as agents of the Village of
Middleport.  Such inspectors, meter readers, or employees authorized by the
Village of Middleport must have free access at all reasonable hours to all
parts of the building for the purpose of inspecting meters, examining fixtures
and observing the manner in which the water is used or wastewater is
discharged.  In case any authorized inspector, meter reader or employee is
refused admittance to any examination, the water will be turned off and not
turned on again until free access is given.

Rule 17.  Whenever a break or leak occurs in a service line between the main
and the curb box, the Village of Middleport will repair this at its own expense
as soon as possible, but if said break or leak occurs back of the curb or meter
or at any place upon the premises supplied, the property owner shall have the
break or leak repaired at his or her own expense.  Failure to make repairs may
result in water being turned off.
Rule 18.  Owners of the real property shall be held responsible for water used
in their premises; however, payments may be accepted from tenants.  All unpaid
accounts shall be a lien against the real property served, and may, at the
discretion of the Village of Middleport, be certified to the Meigs County
Auditor's Office and assessed on the record owner's property tax bill.
Rule 19.  The Village of Middleport does not guarantee any fixed pressure or
continuous supply, but it will, in case of accident that will cause shortages
or water to be shut off, endeavor to notify consumers affected thereby.  Those
using steam boilers and receiving their supply directly from the Village mains
should have a tank large enough to hold an ample supply for emergency cases as
no claims will be considered for damage of any nature whatsoever, arising from
such action.  The Village of Middleport will not be held responsible for
damages caused by stoppages in house service laterals from the house to the
main.
Rule 20.  The Village of Middleport will, on its initiative, undertake to test
and correct any meter, which in its judgment is registering incorrectly,
without the consent of the owner.  The Village of Middleport shall not be
responsible for breakage of pipes or valves occurring during the removal or
installation of meters.
Rule 21.  Upon request from an owner, the Village of Middleport will remove any
meter to the meter shop for test.    If upon examination and test, it is found
that the meter registers outside the tolerance limits of 5% over or under on
flows from one to twenty gallons per minute, on all meters, types and sizes, it
shall be considered inaccurate and the water charges will be adjusted on the
basis of this test.  If charges are adjusted, only the current bill will be
subject to change.  The customer has the right to request a meter test at the
time of each billing.  Payment of the bill constitutes acceptance of charges
made.
FIRE PROTECTION SERVICE

approved and the classification of said service determined by the Village of

PENALTY FOR NON PAYMENT OR LATE PAYMENT
Rule 25.  Water bills will be dated and sent by the last working day of each

working days of the date of the request for hearing.  The hearing shall be

of $70.00 will be charged to reinstate service.  When a delinquency results in
a shut-off, the entire bill, delinquent and current charges, must be paid
before service will be restored.  Any persons, firm, corporation, or premises
having a delinquent account shall not be given water service on any other water
account until such delinquent accounts have been paid.  The shut off notice

property if the property is not owner occupied.

follows:
      (1)   Coverage is twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per calendar year per
customer.
      (2)   The leak insurance will cover up to and including three hundred
dollars ($300.00) per calendar year, per customer.  After this amount is
reached the customer will be responsible for the balance of the bill.
      (3)   Insurance is valid only if the Middleport Public Works Department
is notified before and after the leak is repaired.
        (4)   To figure the amount to be paid if a water leak occurs, the
customer’s bill will be averaged for the twelve months preceding.  This average
will be deducted from the leak amount.  The remaining balance will be
considered a leak and the leak amount will be paid through the Water Leak
Insurance once the repairs are finished and inspected.  The amount available
for payment each calendar year is three hundred dollars ($300.00) per customer.
      (5)   The annual fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) must be paid by June
30th of each year.  The insurance will be in effect from July 1 to June 30 of
each year.  Payments received after the deadline will be excluded from coverage

agreement, nor restrictive covenants running with the land to which the Village
is a party.
   Where this Zoning Ordinance imposes a greater restriction upon land,
buildings or structures than is imposed or required by such existing provision
of law, ordinance, contract or deed, the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance
shall control.
(Ord. 871A. Passed 12-13-65.)
1111.04  COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS.
   (a)    No building shall be erected, converted or altered nor shall any

building shall be erected, enlarged or altered except in conformity with the
area regulations, minimum yard requirements and minimum off-street parking
space requirements of this Zoning Ordinance for the district in which such
building is located.
   (b)    No part of a yard or other open space required about any building for
the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall be
included as a part of a yard or other open space similarly required for another
building.
(Ord. 871A. Passed 12-13-65.)

1117.01  APPOINTMENT; TERM; REMOVAL.
   There is hereby established a Board of Zoning Appeals which shall consist of

shall choose a successor to fill any vacancy. The five electors first appointed
shall serve for terms of one, two, three, four and five years, respectively;
thereafter appointments shall be for five-year terms, beginning January 1. Each
member shall serve until his successor is appointed and qualified. Members of
the Board shall be removable for nonperformance of duty, misconduct in office
or other cause, by Council, upon written charges having been filed with Council
and after a public hearing has been held regarding such charges, a copy of the
charges having been served upon the member so charged at least ten days prior
to the hearing, either personally or by certified mail or by leaving the same
at his usual place of residence. The member shall be given an opportunity to be
heard and answer such charges.
(871A. Passed 12-13-65.)
1117.02  ORGANIZATION; PROCEDURE; QUORUM; DEPARTMENT ASSISTANCE.
   (a)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall organize annually to elect a
Chairman, a Vice Chairman and Secretary. It shall further adopt rules for its
own government not inconsistent with law or with any other ordinances of the
Municipality to carry into effect the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)    Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call of the Chairman and
at such other times as the Board may determine. The Chairman, or in his absence
the Vice Chairman, may administer oaths, and the Board may compel the
attendance of witnesses. All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public.
The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote of each member
upon questions, or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact and
shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which
shall be immediately filed in the Office of Clerk-Treasurer and shall be a
public record.
   (c)    Three members of the Board shall constitute a quorum. The Board shall
act by resolution, and the concurring vote of three members of the Board shall
be necessary to reverse any order or determination of the Zoning Inspector or
to decide in favor of an applicant any matter of which the Board has original
jurisdiction under this Zoning Ordinance or to grant any variance from the
requirements stipulated in this Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)    The Board may call upon the various departments of the Municipality
for assistance in the performance of its duties, and it shall be the duty of
such departments to render such assistance to the Board as may reasonably be
required.
(Ord. 871A.  Passed 12-13-65.)
1117.03  APPLICATIONS; APPEALS PROCEDURE AND FEES.
   (a)    An application, in cases in which the Board of Zoning Appeals has
original jurisdiction under the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, may be
taken by any person aggrieved, including a tenant, or by a governmental
officer, department, board or bureau.  Such application shall be filed with the
Zoning Inspector, who shall transmit the same to the Board.
   (b)    Appeals may be taken before the Board by any person aggrieved or by
an officer of the Municipality affected by any decision of the Zoning
Inspector.  Such appeal shall be taken within twenty days after the decision by
filing with the Zoning Inspector and with the Board a notice of appeal
specifying the grounds thereof. The Zoning Inspector from whom the appeal is
taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the
record.
   (c)    An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from unless the Zoning Inspector shall certify to the Board, after the
notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a
restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by a court of equity
after notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause
shown.
   (d)    The Board may, in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from and shall make such order,
requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to be made in
the premises, and to that end shall have all powers of the Zoning Inspector
from whom the appeal is taken.
   (e)    Appeals shall be accompanied by a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00)
which shall be credited to the General Fund of the Municipality. In the event
the appeal is sustained by the Board, the fee shall not be refunded to the
applicant.
(Ord. 871A.  Passed 12-13-65.)
1117.04  HEARINGS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of
an appeal, give thirty days' public notice thereof in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Municipality and at least twenty days' notice to parties
having property interest in land within 200 feet. At this hearing, any party
may appear in person or by attorney.
   The hearings of the Board shall be public. However, the Board may go into
executive session for discussion, but not for vote on any case before it.
   Upon the day for hearing any application or appeal, the Board may adjourn
the hearing to a specified time to obtain additional information or to notify
other property owners who may be substantially interested in such application
or appeal. In the case of an adjourned hearing, persons previously notified and
persons already heard need not be notified of the time of resumption of the
hearing unless the Board so decides.
(Ord. 871A.  Passed 12-13-65.)
1117.05  DECISIONS.
   The Board shall decide all applications and appeals within thirty days after
the final hearing thereon. A certified copy of the Board's decision shall be
transmitted to all parties in interest. Such decision shall be binding upon the
Zoning Inspector and he shall incorporate the terms and conditions of the same
in the permit to the applicant or appellant whenever a permit is authorized by
the Board.
   A decision of the Board shall not become final until the expiration of five
days from the date such decision is made unless the Board shall find that the
immediate taking effect of such decision is necessary for the preservation of
property or personal rights and shall so certify on the record. (Ord. 871A. 
Passed 12-13-65.)
1117.06  POWERS.
   (a)    Conditional Uses, Exceptions and Interpretations.  The Board of
Zoning Appeals shall have the power to hear and decide, in accordance with the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, applications, filed as provided in Section
1117.03, for conditional uses, special exceptions or for interpretation of the
Zoning Map, or for decisions upon other special questions on which the Board is
authorized by this Zoning Ordinance to pass. In considering an application for
a conditional use, a special exception or interpretation of the Zoning Map, the
Board shall give due regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent uses
and structures; and in authorizing a conditional use or special exception, the
Board may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to location,
construction, maintenance and operation, in addition to those expressly
stipulated in this Zoning Ordinance for the particular conditional use or
special exception, as the Board may deem necessary for the protection of
adjacent properties and the public interest.
   (b)    Administrative Review.  The Board shall have the power to hear and
decide appeals, filed as provided in Section
1117.03, where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error in any order,
requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by the Zoning Inspector or other
administrative official in the interpretation of or the provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)    Variances.  The Board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals
and authorize such variances from the provisions or requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest. In authorizing a
variance, the Board may attach conditions and require such guarantee or bond as
it may deem necessary to assure compliance with the objectives of this Zoning
Ordinance. On appeal where there is unnecessary hardship, the Board may grant a
variance in the application of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance only if
all of the following findings are made:
      (1)    That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions, and not to circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located.
      (2)    That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance
is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      (3)    That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
      (4)    That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
      (5)    That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
   (d)    Performance Requirements.  The Board shall have the power to
authorize issuance of a Zoning certificate for uses that are subject to
performance requirements as set forth in this Zoning Ordinance provided:
      (1)    The application for a zoning certificate for a use subject to
performance requirements shall be accompanied by a plan of the proposed
construction or development; a description of the proposed machinery, processes
and products; and specifications for the mechanisms and techniques to be used
in meeting the performance requirements.
      (2)    The Board may refer the application to one or more expert
consultants qualified to advise as to whether a proposed use will conform to
the performance requirements. The costs of such services shall be borne by the
applicant, and a copy of any reports shall be furnished to the applicant.
   (e)    Nonconforming Uses.  The Board shall have the power to permit changes
and extensions for nonconforming uses as follows:
      (1)    If no structural alterations are made, any lawful nonconforming
use may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Board finds
that the proposed use is more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use.
      (2)    An existing, legal nonconforming use which occupies only a portion
of an existing building or premises may be extended throughout such building or
premises.
      (3)    The Board may impose such requirements and conditions as they deem
necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest. No
change or alteration of a nonconforming use shall entail structural alterations
beyond those required by law; and provided that the value of such extensions
shall not exceed, in all, twenty percent of the existing ground floor area of
the existing building devoted to a nonconforming use and that such extension
shall be within a distance of not more than twenty-five feet of the existing
building or premises; and provided further, that such extension shall in any
case be undertaken within ten years of the enactment of this section,
(Ordinance 871A, passed December 13, 1965), provided only one such extension
will be permitted. However, the Board shall not authorize any extension or
enlargement which would result in extending the useful life of a nonconforming
building or which would result in violation of the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance with respect to any adjoining premises.  (Ord. 871A.  Passed 12-13-
65.)
1117.07  APPEALS FROM BOARD TO COUNCIL.
   (a)    Any person, firm or corporation, or any officer, department, board or
agency of the Municipality, or any interested elector of the Municipality who
has been aggrieved or affected by any decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals
may appeal from such decision to Council by filing notice of intent to appeal
within five days and filing a petition with the Clerk-Treasurer within fifteen
days from the date of the decision and setting forth the facts of the case.
   (b)    Council shall hold a public hearing on such appeal not later than
thirty days after such appeal has been filed with the Clerk-Treasurer. Council,
by an affirmative vote of a majority of its members, shall decide the matter.

1119.01  POWER OF COUNCIL TO MAKE AMENDMENTS UPON RECEIPT OF RECOMMENDATIONS
FROM PLANNING COMMISSION.
   Whenever the public necessity, convenience, general welfare or good zoning
require, Council may, by ordinance, after receipt of recommendations thereon
from the Planning Commission and subject to the procedures provided by law,
amend, supplement or change the regulation, district boundaries or
classifications of property, now or hereafter established by Ordinance 871A,
passed December 13, 1965, or amendments thereof. It shall be the duty of the
Planning Commission to submit its recommendations regarding all applications or
proposals for amendments or supplements to Council.
(Ord. 871A.  Passed 12-13-65.)
1119.02  PROCEDURE FOR CHANGE IN ZONING DISTRICT.
   (a)    Application for Change.  Application for any change of district
boundaries or classifications of property as shown on the District Map, shall
be submitted to the Planning Commission, at its public office, upon such forms,
and shall be accompanied by such data and information, as may be prescribed for
that purpose by the Commission, so as to assure the fullest practicable
presentation of facts for the permanent record. Each such application shall be
verified by at least one of the owners or lessees of property within the area
proposed to be reclassified, attesting to the truth and correctness of all
facts and information presented with the applications. Applications for
amendments initiated by the Commission shall be accompanied by its motion
pertaining to such proposed amendment.
   (b)    Names and Addresses of Adjacent Property Owners.  Any person or
persons desiring a change in the zoning classification of property shall file
with the application for such change, a statement giving the names and
addresses of the owners of all properties lying within 200 feet of any part of
the property, the zoning classification of which is proposed to be changed.
   (c)    Public Hearing by Planning Commission.  Before submitting its
recommendations on a proposed amendment to Council, the Planning Commission may
hold a public hearing thereon, notice of which shall be given by publication in
a newspaper of general circulation in the community once a week for two weeks.
The notice shall state the place or places and times at which the proposed
amendment to the Zoning Ordinance, including text and maps, may be examined.
   (d)    Notice to Property Owners.  In addition to the published notice as
specified in subsection (c) hereof, the Planning Commission shall give notice
of the time, place and purpose of public hearings to be held by it on proposed
amendments or supplements, by mailing a notice by first class mail not less
than twenty days prior to the date of hearing, to the owners of all properties
lying within 200 feet of any part of the property proposed to be changed. The
failure to notify as provided in this section shall not invalidate any
recommendations adopted hereunder, it being the intention of this section to
provide, so far as may be possible, due notice to the persons substantially
interested in the proposed change that an application is pending before the
Commission, proposing to make a change in the District Map or the regulations
set forth in this Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)    Action of Commission.  The Commission may recommend that the
application be granted as requested, or it may recommend a modification of the
zoning amendment requested in the application, or it may recommend that the
application be denied. The recommendation shall then be certified to Council.
   (f)    Public Hearing by Council.  After receiving from the Planning
Commission the certification of such recommendation on the proposed amendment,
and before adoption of such amendment, Council shall hold a public hearing
thereon, at least thirty days' notice of the time and place of which shall be
given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the community
once a week for two weeks.
   (g)    Action of Council.  After receiving from the Planning Commission
certification of the recommendation on the proposed amendment and after holding
the above public hearing, Council shall consider such recommendation and vote
on the passage of the proposed amendment to the text of the Zoning Ordinance or
the District Map. Council may pass an ordinance overruling the recommendation
of the Planning Commission by favorable vote of not less than three-fourths of
all of its members.
(Ord. 871A.  Passed 12-13-65.)
1119.03  APPLICATION FEES; REFUND.
   (a)    At the time that an application for a change of zoning districts is
filed with the Planning Commission, as provided in Section
1119.02, there shall be deposited with the Mayor, the sum of fifty dollars
($50.00) as a fee to cover investigation, legal notices and other expenses
incidental to the determination of such matter, such fee to be for one lot or
part of one lot. An additional fee of five dollars ($5.00) shall be deposited
for each additional lot or part of an additional lot which may be included in
the request, such additional lot or part of a lot to be adjacent to each other.
Such sums so deposited shall be credited by the Mayor to the General Fund of
the Municipality.
   (b)    In the event that the Planning Commission disapproves the application
and the petitioner elects not to have the same certified to Council, then a
refund of thirty dollars ($30.00) plus an additional refund of three dollars
($3.00) for each additional lot or part of an additional lot which was included
in the application should be made to the petitioner by the Clerk-Treasurer,
provided that the Clerk-Treasurer is notified of such election by the
petitioner within thirty days from the time of the action taken by the Planning
Commission.

1131.02  DISTRICT MAP.
   (a)   The boundaries of the districts are shown upon the Map which is made a
part of this Zoning Ordinance, which map is designated as the District Map. 
The District Map and all the notations, references and other information shown
thereon are a part of this Zoning Ordinance and have the same force and effect
as if the District Map and all the notations, references and other information
shown thereon were all fully set or described herein, the original of which

   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the
districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
   (a)   The district boundary lines on the Map are intended to follow either
center lines of streets or alleys or lot lines; and, where the districts
designated on the map are bounded approximately by such street, alley or lot
lines, the street or alley or lot line shall be construed to be the boundary of
the district, unless such boundary is otherwise indicated on the Map.  In the
case of unsubdivided property, the district boundary lines shall be determined
by the use of dimensions appearing on the District Map.
   (b)   Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad line, such
boundary shall be deemed to be located midway between the main tracks of such
railroad line.
   (c)   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official
action of Council, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street,
alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such
vacation, and all area included in the vacation shall then and henceforth be
subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended districts.
   (d)   In every case where property has not been specifically included within
a district, or where territory has become a part of the Village by annexation,
the same shall automatically be classed as lying and being in the R-
1 Residential District until such classification has been changed by an
amendment to the District Map as provided by law.  (Ord. 871A.  Passed 12-13-

owner.
   (b)    The operator shall file with the Board a location map which clearly
shows areas to be mined and the location of adjacent properties, roads and
natural features.
   (c)    The operator shall submit information on the anticipated depth of
excavations and on the depth and probable effect upon the existing water table.
   (d)    The operator shall file with the Board a detailed plan for the

1137.18  DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS FOR M-1 AND M-2 DISTRICTS.
   The following regulations, conditions and procedures shall apply to the
development of properties for permitted and conditional uses in M-1 and M-
2 Industrial Districts:
   (a)    General Provisions.
      (1)    The owner of a tract of land located in any district where or near
where a proposed restricted industrial area is shown on the future land use
plan, containing not less than ten acres, may submit to the Planning Commission
for its review a preliminary plan for the use and development of such tract of
land for industrial uses permitted in accordance with the provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)    In accepting such plan for review the Commission must be satisfied
that the proponents of the office or industrial development are financially
able to carry out the proposed project; that they intend to start construction
within one year of the approval of the project and intend to complete it within
a reasonable time as determined by the Commission.
   (b)    Location and Character of Development.
      (1)    The proposed office and industrial development shall be located so
that reasonably direct traffic access is supplied from principal thoroughfares
and where congestion will not likely be created by the proposed development; or
where such congestion will be obviated by presently projected improvements of
access thoroughfares, by demonstrable provisions in the plan for proper
entrances and exits, and by internal provisions for traffic and parking.
      (2)    The plan shall provide for an office or industrial development
consisting of one or more buildings of integrated and harmonious design,
together with adequate and properly arranged traffic and parking facilities and
landscaping, which will be an attractive development and which will fit
harmoniously into and will have no adverse affects upon the adjoining or
surrounding development.
   (c)    Regulations.  The following regulations shall apply to office and
industrial developments in M-1 and M-2 Districts:
      (1)    Building heights.  No building shall exceed three stories or
forty-five feet in height, except as modified by subparagraph (2) hereof.
      (2)    Yards.  No building shall be less than seventy-five feet distant
from any boundary of the tract on which the office or industrial development is
located.  Loading and storage shall be permanently screened from all adjoining
properties located in any R district by building walls, or a solid wall or
compact evergreen hedge at least six feet in height. All intervening spaces
between the street pavement and the right-of-way line and intervening spaces
between buildings, drives, parking areas and improved areas shall be landscaped
with trees and plantings and properly maintained at all times.
      (3)    Tract coverage.  The ground area occupied by all the buildings
shall not exceed in the aggregate twenty-five percent of the total area of the
lot or tract.
      (4)    Parking space.  Notwithstanding any other requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance there shall be provided one off-street space for each two
employees on the maximum working shift. Parking areas will not be located
closer than twenty-five feet to any adjoining lot line in any R or B District
and shall be set back at least fifty feet from the street right-of-way line.
The parking area shall be graded for proper drainage and improved so as to
provide a durable and dust-free surface.
      (5)    Loading space.  Notwithstanding any other requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance, there shall be provided off-street loading or unloading space
sufficient in area and vertical clearance to accommodate the maximum number of
trucks and tractor-trailers anticipated at anyone time.
      (6)    Access drives and illumination of parking areas. Access drives and
illumination of parking areas shall conform to the requirements of Section
1161.04.
      (7)    Signs.  Signs for office and industrial developments shall be
limited to wall-type signs on the principal building except that a small free-
standing identification and directional sign not over fifteen square feet in
area may be erected at entrances to the office and industrial development. If
signs are illuminated, the source of light shall not be visible.
   (d)    Submission and Approval of Final Development Plan.
      (1)    Upon determination by the Commission that the proposed office or
industrial development, as shown by the preliminary plan, appears to conform to
the requirements of this section and all other applicable requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance, the proponents shall prepare and submit a final development
plan, which plan shall incorporate any changes or modifications required or
suggested by the Commission.
      (2)    If the final development plan is found to comply with the
requirements set forth in this section and other applicable provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance, the Commission shall submit the plan with its report and
recommendations, together with the required application for a zoning
certificate to Council, which shall hold a public hearing on the proposed
development plan.
      (3)    Following a public hearing, Council may modify the plan,
consistent with the intent and meaning of this Zoning Ordinance and authorize
the issuance of a zoning certificate.
      (4)    After the final development plan has been approved by Council and
in the course of carrying out this plan, adjustments or rearrangements of
buildings, parking areas, entrances, heights or yard may be requested by the
proponents, and, provided such requests conform to the standards established by
the final development plan and this Zoning Ordinance, such adjustments or
rearrangements may be authorized by the Commission.  (Ord. 871A. Passed 12-13-
65.)

1167.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Any lawful use of building or land existing at the effective date of
this section (Ordinance 871A, passed December 13, 1965), may be continued, even
though such use does not conform to the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
The nonconforming uses of a building may be extended throughout those existing
parts of the building which were arranged or designed for such use. No
nonconforming building or structure shall be moved, extended, enlarged or
altered, except when authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance
with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)    Whenever the use of a building or land becomes nonconforming through
a change in the Zoning Ordinance or in the district boundaries, such use may be
continued.
   (c)    A nonconforming use which is discontinued for a period of one year

district in which it is located.
   (d)    A nonconforming building which has been damaged by fire, explosion,
act of God or the public enemy to the extent of more than sixty percent of its

the Zoning Inspector by the owner or lessee of the building or land occupied by
such nonconforming use within one year of the effective date of Ordinance 871A,
passed December 13, 1965, or amendment.
   It shall be the duty of the Zoning Inspector to issue a certificate for a
lawful nonconforming use. Failure to apply for such certificate for a
nonconforming use or refusal of the Zoning Inspector to issue such certificate
shall be evidence that such nonconforming use was either illegal or did not
lawfully exist at the effective date of Ordinance 871A, passed December 13,
1965, or amendment. (Ord. 871A. Passed 12-13-65.)

1337.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of Middleport, State of Ohio, does ordain as
follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The Village of Middleport has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Middleport as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional
areas of special flood hazard annexed by the Village of Middleport.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study, Meigs County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map, Meigs County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective May 19, 2014.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard,
include:
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the The Village of Middleport as required by Section
1337.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Village of Middleport, 659 Pearl Street Middleport,
Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance , the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Middleport, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as  whole, or any part thereof other
than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 89-14.  Passed 4-14-14.)
1337.02    DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   Base Flood:  The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or

chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE):  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement:  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development:  Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,

   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding:  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
         Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus 0 feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway: 
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure:  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by the Village of Middleport's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home:  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3781.06 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Middleport
Flood Insurance Rate Map, September 29, 1978, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect:  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer:  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement:  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.  (Ord. 89-14.  Passed 4-14-14.)

identified in Section
1337.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section

by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
 1337.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the
Village of Middleport, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation / Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Middleport have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Middleport Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village
of Middleport boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of
the Village of Middleport suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of Middleport has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and / or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1337.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point.  Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1337.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village of Middleport specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1337.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 89-14.  Passed 4-14-14.)
1337.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   Council shall appoint an Appeals Board consisting of five Village

Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
Village of Middleport Floodplain Administrators office, 659 Pearl Street,
Middleport, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1337.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. 
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 5 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
 1337.05(d)(3)A.1. to 11. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Meigs County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 89-14.  Passed 4-14-14.)
