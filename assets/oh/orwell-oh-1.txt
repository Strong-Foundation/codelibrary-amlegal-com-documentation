PRELIMINARY UNIT
EDITOR'S NOTE
Â Â Â Â Â Â The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
Â Â Â Â Â Â With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded
almost endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of
every ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It
indicates whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another
into one section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct
the user to subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a
given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
EDITOR'S NOTE:Â Â The 2001 Codified Ordinances of Orwell comprises ordinances and
resolutions enacted by Council or new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. Sections and subsections of the 2001 Codified Ordinances without a
history or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are new
matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance, i.e. the ordinance that approves,
adopts and enact these Codified Ordinances. In the following table the
disposition of all source material in the 2001 Codified Ordinances of Orwell is
indicated.

electors of the Village of Orwell, voting in the last general election, may be
filed with the Clerk of Council/Finance Director of Council, who shall note
thereon the name and address of the person filing the petition and date of such

thereof to said petition. Such petition may be circulated in separate parts,
but the separate parts shall be bound together and filed as one instrument.
Each part shall contain the name and filed as one instrument. Each part shall
contain the name and office of the person whose removal is sought and a written
statement of the grounds for the removal.

the Clerk shall determine whether or not it meets the requirements thereof. If
the Clerk shall find the petition insufficient, he/she shall promptly certify
the particulars in which the petition is defective, deliver a copy of this
certificate to the person who filed the petition, and make a record of such
delivery. Such person shall be allowed a period of twenty (20) days after the
day on which such delivery was made in which to make the petition sufficient.
If the Clerk shall find the petition sufficient, he/she shall promptly so
certify to the Council, shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the officer
whose removal is sought and shall make a record of such delivery. If such
officer shall not resign within five (5) days after the day on which such
delivery shall have been made, the Council shall thereupon fix a day for
holding a recall election, not less than sixty (60) days nor more than seventy-
five (75) days after the date of such delivery. At such recall election this
question shall be placed upon the ballot: "Shall (naming the officer) be
allowed to continue as (naming the officer)?", with the provision on the ballot
for voting affirmatively or negatively, and in the event a majority of the vote
is negative, such officer shall be considered as removed, his/her office shall
be deemed vacant and such vacancy shall be filled as provided in this Charter.
The officer removed by such recall election shall not be eligible for

Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The repeal of a repealing provision of these Codified Ordinances does

(ORC 1.57)
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of a provision of these Codified

202.06Â Â Â CONFLICTS OF LAWS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â All ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations of the
Municipality, and all parts of the same, enacted prior to the date of the
adoption of these Codified Ordinances and inconsistent or in conflict with any
of the provisions of these Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed, save and
except any ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same,
expressly excepted from repeal by the ordinance that adopts these Codified
Ordinances. No ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation, or part of the same,
of the Municipality, that is not inconsistent or in conflict with any of the
provisions of these Codified Ordinances and/or that can be reasonably
interpreted to be compatible with the provisions of these Codified Ordinances,
shall be deemed to be repealed by the adoption of these Codified Ordinances.
Such ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations, and all parts of the same,
shall continue to be viable and enforceable by the Municipality.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â In the event of a conflict between any of the provisions of these
Codified Ordinances, or between any of the provisions of these Codified
Ordinances and a provision of any standard code adopted by the Municipality
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231 or a Municipal Charter, the provision that
establishes the higher or stricter standard shall control. In the event of a
conflict between any of the provisions of these Codified Ordinances and any
provision of State law, including rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to
State law, the State law, rule or regulation shall control if the provision of
these Codified Ordinances is of a kind required to be in conformity with State
law by Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution; otherwise, the
provision of these Codified Ordinances shall control.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings
of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to
be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)

(ORC 1.48)
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â If a provision of these Codified Ordinances is ambiguous, the court,
in determining the intention of Council, may consider, among other matters:

(ORC 1.49)
202.08Â Â Â SEPARABILITY.
Â Â Â If any provision of a section of these Codified Ordinances or the
application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the section or
related sections which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application, and to this end the provisions are separable. (ORC 1.50)

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
Â Â Â EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a State legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State.

206.01Â Â Â MEETINGS OF PUBLIC BODIES TO BE OPEN; EXCEPTIONS.
Â Â Â This chapter shall be liberally construed to require public officials to
take official action and to conduct all deliberations upon official business
only in open meetings, unless the subject matter is specifically excepted by
law.
206.02Â Â Â DEFINITIONS.
Â Â Â As used in this chapter:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â "Meeting" means any prearranged discussion of the public business of
the public body by a majority of its members.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â "Public body" means any of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any board, commission, committee, council or similar decision-
making body of a state agency, institution, or authority, and any legislative
authority or board, commission, committee, council, agency, authority or
similar decision-making body of any county, township, municipal corporation,
school district or other political subdivision or local public institution;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any committee or subcommittee of a body described in paragraph (b)
(1) hereof;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A court of jurisdiction of a sanitary district organized wholly for
the purpose of providing a water supply for domestic municipal and public use
when meeting for the purpose of the appointment, removal or reappointment of a
member of the board of directors of such a district pursuant to Ohio R.C.
6115.10, if applicable, or for any other matter related to such a district
other than litigation involving the district. As used in this paragraph, "court
of jurisdiction" has the same meaning as "court" in Ohio R.C. 6115.01.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â "Regulated individual" means either of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A student in a state or local public educational institution;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A person who is, voluntarily or involuntarily, an inmate, patient
or resident of a state or local institution because of criminal behavior,
mental illness or retardation, disease, disability, age or other condition
requiring custodial care.
206.03Â Â Â MEETINGS TO BE OPEN TO PUBLIC; MINUTES.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â  All meetings of any public body are declared to be public meetings
open to the public at all times. A member of a public body shall be present in
person at a meeting open to the public to be considered present or to vote at
the meeting and for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the
meeting.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The minutes of a regular or special meeting of any public body shall
be promptly prepared, filed and maintained and shall be open to public
inspection. The minutes need only reflect the general subject matter of
discussions in executive sessions authorized under Section
206.06.
206.04Â Â Â  NONAPPLICABILITY OF CHAPTER.
Â Â Â This chapter does not apply to a grand jury, to an audit conference
conducted by the Auditor of State or independent certified public accountants
with officials of the public office that is the subject of the audit, or to
other State agencies as set forth in Ohio R.C. 121.22(D) and (E).
206.05Â Â Â NOTIFICATION.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â  Every public body, by rule, shall establish a reasonable method
whereby any person may determine the time and place of all regularly scheduled
meetings and the time, place and purpose of all special meetings. A public body
shall not hold a special meeting unless it gives at least twentyâfour hours
advance notice to the news media that have requested notification, except in
the event of an emergency requiring immediate official action. In the event of
an emergency, the member or members calling the meeting shall notify the news
media that have requested notification immediately of the time, place and
purpose of the meeting.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The above rule shall provide that any person, upon request and payment
of a reasonable fee, may obtain reasonable advance notification of all meetings
at which any specific type of public business is to be discussed. Provisions
for advance notification may include, but are not limited to, mailing the
agenda of meetings to all subscribers on a mailing list or mailing notices in
self-addressed, stamped envelopes provided by the person.
206.06Â Â Â  EXECUTIVE SESSIONS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The members of a public body may hold an executive session only after
a majority of a quorum of the public body determines, by a roll call vote, to
hold an executive session and only at a regular or special meeting for the sole
purpose of the consideration of any of the following matters:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â To consider the appointment, employment, dismissal, discipline,
promotion, demotion or compensation of a public employee or official, or the
investigation of charges or complaints against a public employee, official,
licensee or regulated individual, unless the public employee, official,
licensee or regulated individual requests a public hearing. Except as otherwise
provided by law, no public body shall hold an executive session for the
discipline of an elected official for conduct related to the performance of the
elected official's official duties or for the elected official's removal from
office. If a public body holds an executive session pursuant hereto, the motion
and vote to hold that executive session shall state which one or more of the
approved purposes listed herein are the purposes for which the executive
session is to be held, but need not include the name of any person to be
considered at the meeting.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â To consider the purchase of property for public purposes, or for
the sale of property at competitive bidding, if premature disclosure of
information would give an unfair competitive or bargaining advantage to a
person whose personal, private interest is adverse to the general public
interest. No member of a public body shall use this paragraph as a subterfuge
for providing covert information to prospective buyers or sellers. A purchase
or sale of public property is void if the seller or buyer of the public
property has received covert information from a member of a public body that
has not been disclosed to the general public in sufficient time for other
prospective buyers and sellers to prepare and submit offers.
Â Â Â If the minutes of the public body show that all meetings and deliberations
of the public body have been conducted in compliance with this paragraph, any
instrument executed by the public body purporting to convey, lease or otherwise
dispose of any right, title or interest in any public property shall be
conclusively presumed to have been executed in compliance with this paragraph
insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide purchasers, lessees or
transferees of the property is concerned.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Conferences with an attorney for the public body concerning
disputes involving the public body that are the subject of pending or imminent
court action;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Preparing for, conducting or reviewing negotiations or bargaining
sessions with public employees concerning their compensation or other terms and
conditions of their employment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Matters required to be kept confidential by Federal law or
regulations or State statutes;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Specialized details of security arrangements if disclosure of the
matters discussed might reveal information that could be used for the purpose
of committing, or avoiding prosecution for, a violation of the law.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â If a public body holds an executive session to consider any of the
matters listed in paragraphs (a)(2) to (6) hereof, the motion and vote to hold
that executive session shall state which one or more of the approved matters
listed in paragraphs (a)(2) to (6) hereof, are to be considered at the
executive session.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A public body specified in Section
206.02(b)(3) shall not hold an executive session when meeting for the purposes
specified in such section.
206.07Â Â Â INVALIDITY OF RESOLUTION, RULE OR OTHER FORMAL ACTIONS.
Â Â Â A resolution, rule or formal action of any kind is invalid unless adopted in
an open meeting of the public body. A resolution, rule or formal action adopted
in an open meeting that results from deliberations in a meeting not open to the
public is invalid unless the deliberations were for a purpose specifically
authorized in Section
206.06 and conducted at an executive session held in compliance with Section
206.06. A resolution, rule or formal action adopted in an open meeting is
invalid if the public body that adopted the resolution, rule, or formal action
violated Section
206.05.
206.08 Â Â Â  ENFORCEMENT.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Any person may bring an action to enforce this chapter. An action
under this section shall be brought within two years after the date of the
alleged violation or threatened violation. Upon proof of a violation or
threatened violation of this chapter in an action brought by any person, the
Court of Common Pleas shall issue an injunction to compel the members of the
public body to comply with its provisions.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â If the Court of Common Pleas issues an injunction pursuant to
subsection (a) hereof, the Court shall order the public body that it enjoins to
pay a civil forfeiture of five hundred dollars ($500) to the party that sought
the injunction and shall award to that party all court costs and, subject to
reduction as described in this subsection, reasonable attorney's fees. The
court, in its discretion, may reduce an award of attorney's fees to the party
that sought the injunction or not award attorney's fees to that party if the
court determines both of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â That, based on the ordinary application of statutory law and case
law as it existed at the time of violation or threatened violation that was the
basis of the injunction, a well-informed public body reasonably would believe
that the public body was not violating or threatening to violate this section;
and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â That a well-informed public body reasonably would believe that the
conduct or threatened conduct that was the basis of the injunction would serve
the public policy that underlies the authority that is asserted as permitting
that conduct or threatened conduct.
Â Â Â If the Court of Common Pleas does not issue an injunction pursuant to
subsection (a) hereof and the Court determines at that time that the bringing
of the action was frivolous conduct, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2323.51(A), the
Court shall award to the public body all court costs and reasonable attorney's
fees, as determined by the Court. (3)Â Â Â Irreparable harm and prejudice to the
party that sought the injunction shall be conclusively and irrebuttably
presumed upon proof of a violation or threatened violation of this chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â A member of a public body who knowingly violates an injunction
issued pursuant to subsection (a) hereof may be removed from office by an
action brought in the Court of Common Pleas for that purpose by the prosecuting
attorney or the attorney general.

CHAPTER 212
Use of Cellular Telephones and Pagers
212.01Â Â Â Purpose.
212.02Â Â Â Policy.
212.03Â Â Â Procedures for cellular telephones.
212.04Â Â Â Procedures for use of pagers.
212.01Â Â Â PURPOSE.
Â Â Â The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for the use of
Village owned cellular telephones and pagers.
(Ord. 03-6-1. Passed 6-10-03.)
212.02Â Â Â POLICY.
Â Â Â The Village has purchased cellular telephones and pagers to be utilized by
various departments in the course of their duties. Because of the expense of
the telephones and the associated service fees, the use and accountability of
such items must be controlled.
(Ord. 03-6-1. Passed 6-10-03.)
212.03Â Â Â PROCEDURES FOR CELLULAR TELEPHONES.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Use of Cellular Telephones. Village issued cellular telephones are
intended to be used for official Village business only. Employees using
cellular telephones should remember that wireless communications can be
monitored by the public.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Responsibility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â All employees are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the
use of the cellular telephones.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All employees will be responsible for the proper use and care of
the cellular telephones.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Operation of the Cellular Telephone. Village personnel shall follow
the proper operating instructions for the cellular telephone. Operating
instructions will be distributed to all departments issued cellular telephones.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Cellular Telephone Numbers. Village personnel shall not give cellular
phone numbers to the general public. This is necessary as all departments
issued telephones will share a limited number of monthly hours.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Cellular Telephone Use While Driving. Studies on cellular phone
related vehicle accidents have revealed that those using cellular phones while
driving were four times more likely to have an accident than those not using
phones. As a result of the study findings, and the necessity to reduce employer
liability, cellular phone use while driving is prohibited.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Accountability. Cellular telephone bills will be reviewed monthly to
verify the validity of the calls and insure the phones are not utilized for
personal use.
(Ord. 03-6-1. Passed 6-10-03.)
212.04Â Â Â PROCEDURES FOR USE OF PAGERS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Use of Pagers. Full-time Village personnel and volunteer fire
department personnel will be issued a pager. All personnel issued pagers shall
ensure that the pager is on and functioning properly. All personnel are
responsible for notifying their supervisor when their pagers are not working
properly.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Operation of Pagers. Personnel issued pagers shall ensure the pager is
turned on, in proper working condition and located where they can receive and
answer pages at all times. Employees shall operate the pager in silent mode
when attending meetings, training or other group settings in which it would be
proper to use the pager in silent mode.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Pager Numbers. Department heads and the Village Clerk-Treasurer shall
maintain a list of all pager numbers. Just as the Village does not give out
employee home phone numbers, employee pager numbers shall not be given out by
anyone other than the employee it is issued to. In the event an employee pager
number is requested, the person receiving the request shall offer to page the
employee and enter a contact number for the requesting person.
(Ord. 03-6-1. Passed 6-10-03.)

reasonably foreseeable risk of identity theft.

reporting agency.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A consumer report indicates a pattern of activity inconsistent with

account privileges by a financial institution or creditor.

Public Records Policy
216.01Â Â Â Introduction.
216.02Â Â Â Hours and costs.
216.03Â Â Â How to make a public records request.
216.04Â Â Â Definition.
216.05Â Â Â Records that will not be released.
216.06Â Â Â Limitations; questions or concerns.
216.01Â Â Â INTRODUCTION.
Â Â Â We are an open government. We welcome participation by our citizens. We
believe openness leads to a better informed public, which leads to more
transparent government and better public policy. Citizens are entitled to
access government records and the Ohio Public Records Act should be interpreted
liberally in favor of disclosure.
(Ord. 24-06-06. Passed 6-18-24.)
216.02Â Â Â HOURS AND COSTS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â You may make public records requests to the Village of Orwell between
the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on weekdays, excluding government
holidays.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â For in-house copies of public records on 8.5" x 11" or 8.5" x 14â one
sided paper, the copy cost is ten cents ($.10) per page. Any other forms of
media will be provided at actual cost. We may require you to pay the estimated
copy costs before copies are made. There is no charge for in-house copy
requests that result in a cost less than one dollar ($1.00). However, if
records are mailed to you, we may charge you, in advance, postage costs and the
cost of mailing materials. There is no charge for emailed documents.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Requests for a large number of copies or copies of maps, plans and
drawings may require that the request be reproduced by an outside vendor
identified by the Village. In those instances, the Village will forward the
documents to the vendor for reproduction. You must pay the vendor, in advance,
for the reproduction cost. You will also be responsible for retrieving your
reproduced items from the vendor.
(Ord. 24-06-06. Passed 6-18-24.)
216.03Â Â Â HOW TO MAKE A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
Â Â Â Public records requests may be made in person, by mail, fax, or email. We
will provide prompt inspection of public records and copies of public records
in a reasonable period of time. When you make a request, we will ask you to
complete a âPublic Records Request Form,â which will help us locate the records
and expedite your request. You are not legally required to fill out the form,
identify yourself, or give the purpose of your request. If the records cannot
be provided while you wait, we will contact you when the records are available.
(Ord. 24-06-06. Passed 6-18-24.)
216.04Â Â Â DEFINITION.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Under Ohio law, public records are those items that meet all of the
following elements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any document, device, or item, regardless of physical form or
characteristic, including an electronic record.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â That is created or received by, or coming under the jurisdiction of
a public office; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â That documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions,
procedures, operations, or other activities of the office. This does not
include records kept for our administrative convenience.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â You may ask for a copy of our records retention schedule, which will
familiarize you with the types of records available.
(Ord. 24-06-06. Passed 6-18-24.)
216.05Â Â Â RECORDS THAT WILL NOT BE RELEASED.
Â Â Â Under Ohio law, some records that meet the above elements will still be
withheld from release because state or federal law makes the record
confidential. Some commonly requested records that are confidential include:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Attorney-client privileged information and trial preparation records.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Social security numbers.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Records of ongoing investigations.

Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Any other information as per R.C. Â§ 149.43(A)(7).
(Ord. 24-06-06. Passed 6-18-24.)
216.06Â Â Â LIMITATIONS; QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Limitations. We may limit to ten the number of public records mailed
to you, unless you certify in writing that you do not intend to use the records
for commercial purposes. We will not provide copies of public records that we
create or receive after your original request is completed.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Questions or Concerns. If you have questions or concerns about Ohio
Public Records law, please contact your state legislator. You can find contact
information at www.legislature.ohio.gov. For questions directed to the Village
of Orwell, you may call (440) 437-8398.

TITLE TEN â Judiciary
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chap.
298. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 298
Mayor's Court
Â Â Â EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio RC 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Orwell has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for a violation of an Orwell
ordinance and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving moving traffic
violations occurring of State highways located within the corporate limits of
Orwell, subject to the limitations of Ohio RC 2937.08 and 2938.04. In keeping
his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed by the laws pertaining
to county courts.
Â Â Â Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matte shall not be tried before
the Mayor unless the accused, by a writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the Mayor. If the defendant, in such event,
does not waive his or her right to a jury trials, then the Mayor shall require
the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court of record in
Ashtabula County (the Western County Court) and the Mayor shall thereupon
certify all papers filed, together with a transcript of proceedings and accrued
costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the court of record.
However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that in
petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the defendant shall
be tried by the court unless he or she demands a jury trial. The jurisdiction
of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule 9 of the Ohio
Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not made pursuant to
Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his or her right to a jury trial in
writing, a mayor may try the case only if (1) his or her compensation as a
judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) her or
she is not the chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality
and as such responsible for the financial condition of the municipality. Guilty
and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor.
Â Â Â Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court on record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial, whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04 provides that right
to trial by jury claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the
same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as provided
herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04 provides,
further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts of records, but failure to
waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be asserted shall
require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
Â Â Â Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for a violation of any Ohio statute or of any Orwell
ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not exceed a fine
of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
Â Â Â The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas: the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1979. Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
Â Â Â Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any party who has a legal claim to any support ordered for a child,
spouse, or former spouse may initiate a contempt action for failure to pay the
support. In Title IV-D cases, the contempt action for failure to pay support
also may be initiated by an attorney retained by the party who has the legal
claim, the prosecuting attorney, or an attorney of the Department of Job and
Family Services or the child support enforcement agency.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Any parent who is granted parenting time rights under a parenting time

accused fails to make a good faith effort to retain counsel or to obtain a
public defender;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Notice of the potential penalties that could be imposed upon the

eliminate any obligation of the accused to pay any past, present or future
support obligation or any obligation of the accused to comply with or refrain
from interfering with the parenting time or visitation order or decree. The
court shall have jurisdiction to make a finding of contempt for the failure to
pay support and to impose the penalties set forth in subsection (f) hereof in

Deduct Money Pursuant to Support Order.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In all contempt proceedings, the court shall conduct a hearing. At

or her appearance to be prosecuted, or both. If the bond is prosecuted, the
measure of damages in the action is the extent of loss or injury sustained by

prosecuted, and the costs of the proceeding. Such recovery is for the benefit
of the party injured. (ORC 2705.07)
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Release of Prisoner Committed for Contempt. When a person is committed
to jail for contempt, the court or judge who made the order may discharge him

making the order, payable to the State, with sureties to the acceptance of the
clerk of that court, in an amount fixed by the reviewing court, or a judge
thereof, conditioned that if judgment is rendered against such person, he or
she will abide by and perform the order or judgment. (ORC 2705.09)

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer
issues an offender a ticket, citation, or summons for a violation of any of the
aforementioned sections of the Ohio Revised Code, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the offender may enter
a written plea of guilty and waive the offenderâs right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offenderâs payment and such written evidence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted
while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officerâs law enforcement agency;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Ensure that such report indicates the offenderâs race.
(R.C. Â§ 4511.991)
408.03Â Â Â SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of
time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for
the violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period
of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of

Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â All State routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated

continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or

enter the roadway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Flashing Red Signal Indication.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A Steady Yellow âXâ. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red âXâ signal indication.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A Steady Red âXâ. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

Â Â Â Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words âwalkâ or
âdon't walk,â or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes âwalkâ,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes âdon't
walkâ, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word âwaitâ if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

the right half of the roadway, except as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same
direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such movements;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left
of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for

prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under the
conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available
for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster vehicles if
such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the following
circumstances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â When preparing for a left turn;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other than the

slower vehicle to compromise the driverâs safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Upon any roadway having four or more lanes for moving traffic and
providing for two- way movement of traffic, no vehicle shall be driven to the
left of the center line of the roadway, except when authorized by official
traffic-control devices designating certain lanes to the left of the center of
the roadway for use by traffic not otherwise permitted to use the lanes, or

that the person committed that violation unless the emergency personnel who
filed the report appears in person in the court and testifies.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â As used in this division (e):

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The offender shall be fined, and is subject to a suspension of the
offenderâs driverâs license, commercial driverâs license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege, as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Except as provided in divisions (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., (d)(1)D., and
(d)(2) of this section, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not
more than $150.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one prior violation of this section, R.C. Â§

nonresident operating privilege for 90 days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Notwithstanding divisions (d)(1)A. to (d)(1)C. of this section,
if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with R.C. Â§ 4511.98,
the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose
upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the violation
under division (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as applicable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom division
(d)(1)A. of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of $150 under
division (d)(1)A. of this section and the assessment of points under division
(d)(4) of this section, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted

and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall not be required to pay the fine and shall not have the points assessed
against that offenderâs driverâs license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a
dismissal of the charges for the violation, and the violation is a prior
offense under divisions (d)(1)B. and (d)(1)C. of this section if the offender
commits a subsequent violation or violations of division (a) of this section
within two years of the offense for which the course was completed. This

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. Â§ 4510.036.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. Â§ 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. Â§ 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. Â§ 2941.25.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section

voluntarily and unequivocally gives consent for the officer to access the
device;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Confiscate the device while awaiting the issuance of a warrant to
access the device;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Obtain consent from the operator to access the device through
coercion or any other improper means. Any consent by the operator to access the
device shall be voluntary and unequivocal before the officer may access the
device without a warrant.

Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Evidence; Tests.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. Â§
2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendantâs whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in R.C. Â§ 4511.192(A) as the maximum period
of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under R.C. Â§ 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician- paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that personâs opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. Â§ 3701.143.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, âEmergency medical
technician- intermediateâ and âEmergency medical technician-paramedicâ have the
same meanings as in R.C. Â§ 4765.01.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the personâs own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, "National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration" means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â As used in division (f)(1), âEmergency medical technician-
intermediateâ and âEmergency medical technician-paramedicâ have the same
meanings as in R.C. Â§ 4765.01.

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Effect of Death or Unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation
of R.C. Â§ 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. Â§ 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the personâs whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine for the purpose of
determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the personâs whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine. A law enforcement officer who
makes a request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical
test or tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required
to give the person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but
the officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the
person refuses to take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever
reasonable means are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical
test of the personâs whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall
also advise the person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an
independent chemical test taken at the personâs own expense. Divisions (g)(3)
and (g)(4) of this section apply to the administration of a chemical test or
tests pursuant to this division.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the personâs whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the personâs
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Advice Required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Certification of Arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the personâs
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, the arresting
officer shall read the following form to the person:
Â Â Â "You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested â operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
Â Â Â âIf you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I. or
operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance
or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or municipal law
within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state O.V.I., and,
if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased penalties if you
subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
Â Â Â (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) "If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
Â Â Â If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense."
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Actions Required by Arresting Officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested personâs initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the personâs whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the personâs whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. Â§ 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the personâs whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid,
or urine.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Sworn Report of Arresting Officer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the
Â Â Â Â Â Â Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person by
regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report, but
not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give an
unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â Suspension Effective Immediately. A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division(g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â Initial Appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of
a vehicle in violation of division(o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (ii) and if, within 60 days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio
R.C. 4511.19(G)(1), the court may sentence the offender as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4511.19(G)(3).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â If an offender's driver's or occupational driver's license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (h) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G) and if Ohio R.C. 4510.13 permits the court
to grant limited driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving

requires the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender
must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in

Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order of criminal
forfeiture under division (h)(1)C., D., or E. of this section is assigned or
transferred and Ohio R.C. 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, in addition to or
independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Automobile Dealer's Association. The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be
distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial

thousand dollars ($5,000) for any economic loss arising from an accident or
collision that was the direct and proximate result of the offenderâs operation

offender is sentenced under division (h) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â A court may order an offender to reimburse a law enforcement agency

administered to the offender if all of the following apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The test or tests were of the offenderâs whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, oral fluid, or urine.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The test or tests indicated that the offender had one of the
following at the time of the offense:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A prohibited concentration of a controlled substance or a
metabolite of a controlled substance in the offenderâs whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, or urine;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A drug of abuse or a metabolite of a drug of abuse in the
offenderâs oral fluid.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â A court may warn any person who is convicted of or who pleads
guilty to a violation of division (a) of this section or an equivalent offense
that a subsequent violation of this section or an equivalent offense that
results in the death of another or the unlawful termination of anotherâs
pregnancy may result in the person being guilty of aggravated vehicular
homicide under R.C. Â§ 2903.06. The court may warn the person of the applicable
penalties for that violation under R.C. Â§Â§ 2903.06 and 2929.142.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â As used in division (g) of this section, âelectronic monitoringâ
has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2929.01.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Penalty for Operating a Vehicle After Underage Alcohol Consumption.
Whoever violates division (b) of this section is guilty of operating a motor
vehicle after underage alcohol consumption and shall be punished as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in division (i)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. In addition to
any other sanction imposed for the offense, the court shall impose a class six
suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial driver's license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(6). The court may
grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C.
4510.021 and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an
ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period
of suspension as authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022. If the court grants
unlimited driving privileges under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, the court shall suspend
any jail term imposed under division (i)(1) of this section as required under
that section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of division (a)
of this section or other equivalent offense or offenses, the offender is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the third degree. In addition to any other sanction imposed
for the offense, the court shall impose a class four suspension of the
offenderâs driverâs license, commercial driverâs license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in R.C. Â§ 4510.02(A)(4). The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under R.C. Â§Â§ 4510.021 and 4510.13.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. Â§ 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Â§ 698.02
(f) or R.C. Â§ 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic loss
arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate result
of the offenderâs operation of the vehicle before, during, or after committing
the violation of division (b) of this section.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No court shall sentence an offender to an alcohol treatment
program under this section unless the treatment program complies with the
minimum standards for alcohol treatment programs adopted under Ohio R.C.
Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â An offender who stays in a drivers' intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an
offender who stays in an alcohol treatment program under an order issued under
this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court's indigent drivers' alcohol
treatment fund.

the written documentation described in division (a)(2) of this section, and
employers, school officials, officials affiliated with religious events, and
holders of probationary driverâs licenses may utilize that form or may choose
to utilize any other written documentation to meet the requirements of that
division.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â No holder of a probationary driverâs license who has held the

occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is accompanied by
the probationary license holderâs parent, guardian, or custodian.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â It is an affirmative defense to a violation of division (a)(1)A. or
(a)(1)B. of this section if, at the time of the violation, an emergency existed
that required the holder of the probationary driverâs license to operate a
motor vehicle in violation of division (a)(1)A. or (a)(1)B. of this section or
the holder was an emancipated minor.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If a person is issued a probationary driverâs license prior to
attaining the age of 17 years and the person pleads guilty to, is convicted of,
or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving violation
during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the person is
issued the probationary driverâs license, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the holderâs parent
or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle upon a highway or
any public or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular
travel or parking for a period not to exceed six months or the date the holder
attains the age of 17 years, whichever occurs first.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under division (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for driving privileges without being accompanied by the
holderâs parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that division. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or
subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the violation may
terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this division.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under
division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon
a highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking unless the total number of occupants of the vehicle
does not exceed the total number of occupant restraining devices originally
installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A restricted license may be issued to a person who is 14 or 15 years
of age under proof of hardship satisfactory to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by division (d) of this section, or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons if that requirement has been or is being violated,
or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of that requirement.

section has been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest or
commencing a prosecution of a person for such a violation.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon

on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by division (d) of this section, or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons if that requirement has been or is being violated,
or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of that requirement.
Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated

other person does not have a valid driver's or commercial driver's license or

Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of division (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4)
or (a)(5) of this section has occurred, it shall be prima facie evidence that
the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender's control is in a
category described in division (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this
section if any of the following applies:

consanguinity or affinity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Regarding an operator allegedly in the category described in
division (a)(2) of this section, the offender and the operator of the motor
vehicle reside in the same household, and the offender knows or has reasonable
cause to believe that the operator has been charged with or convicted of any
violation of law or ordinance, or has committed any other act or omission, that

to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the court shall order, for 60 days, the immobilization of the
vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicleâs license
plates. The order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court shall order the criminal forfeiture
to the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. The order shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for
criminal forfeiture under this division is assigned or transferred and Ohio
R.C.4503.234(B)(2) or (B)(3) applies, in addition to or independent of any
other penalty established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of
the vehicle as determined by publications of the National Auto Dealerâs
Association. The proceeds from any fine imposed under this division shall be
distributed in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.234(C)(2).

(c)(3)C. of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court, neither the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept any

vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â This section does not apply to motor vehicle rental dealers or motor

is the subject of the conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from
the wrongful entrustment of a motor vehicle.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â For purposes of this section, a vehicle is owned by a person if, at
the time of a violation of this section, the vehicle is registered in the
personâs name.

license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Section

698.02(f)(1)B.1. and Ohio R.C. 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up
to one thousand dollars ($1,000); and notwithstanding Section
698.02(e)(1)C. and Ohio R.C. 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered
pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be

or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into

division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driverâs or commercial driverâs
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle

jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driverâs or commercial
driverâs license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding Section 698.02(e)(1)C. and Ohio R.C.
2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered pursuant to Section 698.02(e)(3) or
Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to 500 hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under Ohio R.C. 2705.02
(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the offenderâs driverâs or commercial driverâs license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offenderâs driverâs or commercial driverâs license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offenderâs restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender's
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.

within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's

able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.

driver's license under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the
commercial driver's license was suspended under this section, and no person
whose commercial driver's license is suspended under this section shall be

the person at the time of the alleged violation of division (a) of this
section. The person charged with a violation of division (a) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Whoever violates this section is guilty of failure to reinstate a
license, and shall be punished as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Except as provided in division (c)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Section
698.02, Section
698.03 or Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Section
698.02(d) or Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding Section
698.02(f)(1)B.1. and Ohio R.C. 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up
to one thousand dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding Section
698.02(e)(1)C. and Ohio R.C. 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered
pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If, within three years of a violation of division (a) of this
section, the offender previously has pleaded guilty to or been convicted of two
or more violations of this section, Ohio R.C. 4510.21 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In all cases, the court may impose upon the offender a class seven
suspension of the offenderâs driverâs license, commercial driverâs license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary driver's license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).
(ORC 4510.21)
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver's or commercial driver's license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non- economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiffâs failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Penalty.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined

Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â State Regulations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
Ohio R.C. 4513.01 to 4513.37.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Notwithstanding R.C. Â§Â§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. Â§ 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Except as provided in R.C. Â§ 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(2) of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4513.34(G).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than State routes and County
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
State route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
such deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On County roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for such roads and the load resistance of such roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating such weight limits.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Local Permit and Conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of
operation for such vehicle or combination of vehicles by designating the route,
hours, speed or such other restrictions as may be necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by the
Police Department in supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant
shall pay the sum of fifty dollars ($50.00).
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Except as provided in divisions (a) and (b) of this section,
streets and highways shall be posted with signs indicating "no thru trucks -
gross weight 5 tons" or words of similar import to inform drivers of the
limitations imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions
indicated on any such sign.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or
suspension of such permit and denial of request for any future permit. Such
violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections
408.01 and
408.02.

location in violation of division (f)(1)A.1. or (f)(1)A.2. of this section may
be towed or otherwise removed from the parking location by the law enforcement
agency of the municipality. A motor vehicle that is so towed or removed shall
not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of ownership of the
motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally imposed by the
municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor vehicle is a
leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the lessee
presents proof that that person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and pays all
towing and storage fees normally imposed by the municipality for towing and
storing motor vehicles.

person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is
displaying a removable windshield placard or accessible license plates, or when
a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a person with a
disability and is displaying a parking card or accessible license plates, the
motor vehicle is permitted to park for a period of two hours in excess of the
legal parking period permitted by local authorities, except where local
ordinances or police rules provide otherwise or where the vehicle is parked in
such a manner as to be clearly a traffic hazard.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â No owner of an office, facility or parking garage where accessible
parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with division (e)
of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking locations in
accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of the
accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed or
movable signs.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license

organization under prior law have not expired or been surrendered or revoked.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply

or both legs or one or both arms, who is blind, deaf or unable to move without
the aid of crutches or a wheelchair, or whose mobility is restricted by a
permanent cardiovascular, pulmonary or other disabling condition.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â âPerson with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to

Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â For purposes of this division (e), the fact that a motor vehicle
has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie evidence of
abandonment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of

452.06Â Â Â PARKING PROHIBITIONS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY; PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected, may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in R.C. Â§ 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or private
agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this division, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A towing service towing a motor vehicle under division (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Subject to division (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this division may recover the vehicle
only in accordance with division (d) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â As used in this section, âprivate residential propertyâ means
private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence, or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than
three separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. The
phrase does not include any private property on which is located one or more
structures that are used as a home, residence, or sleeping place by two or more
persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in the structure
or structures.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been
ordered into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section arrives after
the motor vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual
removal from the property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator
oral or written notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner
or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to
obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if the vehicle is within a
municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has established a vehicle
removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or
written notification that the owner or operator may pay not more than one-half
of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal
corporation shall maintain a record of motor vehicles that the chief orders
into storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section. The record shall
include an entry for each such motor vehicle that identifies the motor
vehicleâs license number, make, model, and color, the location from which it
was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chiefâs order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 or, if the
vehicle was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for
vehicle removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under division
(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted

zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all

If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property

without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall

the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and
to the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

vehicle that has been removed under this division (h), subject to division (h)
(3) of this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with division (h)(7)
of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck

prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private

which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â BÂ Â Â A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (h)
(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with division (h)(1) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under division
(a)(2) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of removing the
vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the municipal

property in the chiefâs jurisdiction that is established as a private tow-away
zone of which the chief has received notice under this division (h). The record
shall include all information submitted by the towing service. The chief shall
provide any information in the record that pertains to a particular vehicle to
a person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner, operator, or lienholder of the vehicle and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.

by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by certified mail
with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service utilizing any form
of delivery requiring a signed receipt;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the vehicle remains unclaimed 30 days after the first

providing for criminal procedure shall be construed so as to effect the fair,
impartial, speedy, and sure administration of justice.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Any provision of a section of this General Offenses Code that refers
to a previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a violation of a section of
this General Offenses Code, the Ohio Revised Code or a division of a section of
this General Offenses Code or the Ohio Revised Code shall be construed to also
refer to a previous conviction of or plea of guilty to a substantially
equivalent offense under an existing or former law of this Municipality, State,
another state, or the United States or under an existing or former municipal
ordinance.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Any provision of this Code that refers to a section, or to a division
of a section, of this Code that defines or specifies a criminal offense shall
be construed to also refer to an existing or former law of this State, another
state, or the United States, to an existing or former municipal ordinance, or
to an existing or former division of any such existing or former law or
ordinance that defines or specifies, or that defined or specified, a
substantially equivalent offense.

any element of which takes place in this Municipality;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality and the
other jurisdiction or, while in this Municipality, the person conspires to
commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under
both the laws of this Municipality and the other jurisdiction, and a
substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is undertaken in this
Municipality by the person or another person involved in the conspiracy,
subsequent to the personâs entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction, or activity in this Municipality;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or

network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this State or Municipality.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â In homicide, the element referred to in division (a)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes
death, the death itself, or any other element that is set forth in the offense
in question. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this
Municipality, the death is presumed to have occurred within this Municipality.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â This Municipality includes the land and water within its
boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this Municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this Municipality and another jurisdiction is
disputed, the disputed territory is conclusively presumed to be within this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The courts of common pleas of Adams, Athens, Belmont, Brown,
Clermont, Columbiana, Gallia, Hamilton, Jefferson, Lawrence, Meigs, Monroe,
Scioto, and Washington counties have jurisdiction beyond the north or northwest

extended boundary lines of any adjacent counties or adjacent state. Each of
those courts of common pleas has concurrent jurisdiction on the Ohio River with
any adjacent court of common pleas that borders on that river and with any
court of Kentucky or of West Virginia that borders on the Ohio River and that
has jurisdiction on the Ohio River under the law of Kentucky or the law of West
Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under Federal law.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â For purposes of division (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â As used in this section, "computer," "computer system," "computer
network," "information service," "telecommunication," "telecommunications
device," "telecommunications service," "data" and "writing" have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.

committing a violation set forth in division (a)(3)A. of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in divisions (d) to (l) of this

the offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved person's legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved personâs legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)
(3) of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the
following offenses during the following specified periods of time:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â As used in this division:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The phrase âoffense is directly related to the misconduct in
office of a public servantâ includes, but is not limited to, a violation of
Ohio R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A),
2921.43(A) or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense
involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â âPublic servantâ has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03
is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and
if the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined
to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time
of the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â As used in this division, âDNA recordâ has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 109.573.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this
Municipality or conceals the accused's identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused's purpose to avoid prosecution.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â As used in this section, âpeace officerâ has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
Â Â Â (l)Â Â Â The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section apply to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015
and apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July
16, 2015 if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section as
it existed on July 15, 2015.

606.07Â Â Â REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in Ohio R.C. Title XLV.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â As used in this section:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â âCulpability.â Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â âIntoxication.â Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â âInvoluntary acts.â Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â âPossession.â A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08Â Â Â CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A person acts purposely when it is the personâs specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offenderâs specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the personâs conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the personâs conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the personâs
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
606.09Â Â Â ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officerâs, agentâs, or employeeâs office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officerâs, agentâs, or employeeâs office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a boardâs or personâs office or employment.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â As used in this section, âorganizationâ means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. âOrganizationâ does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.10Â Â Â PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.11Â Â Â ATTEMPTS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â As used in this section:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â "Drug abuse offense" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â "Motor vehicle" has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
606.12Â Â Â COMPLICITY.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio

(ORC 955.22)
Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â Hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the personâs jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dogâs owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dogâs owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the courtâs final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, Ohio R.C 955.11
(D) and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and
the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog,
and Section 618.21 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous
dog, and the court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions
apply with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that
manner. As part of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or
harborer to obtain the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an
amount described in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â As used in this division (k), ânuisance dogâ, âdangerous dogâ, and
âvicious dogâ have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 955.11.

this section, if the offender is guilty of a violation of division (c) of this
section or a violation of division (d) of this section that involves a dog that
is not a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the court may order the

(ORC 955.99(E))
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Whoever commits a violation of division (d) of this section
that involves a nuisance dog is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on the first
offense and of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree on each subsequent offense
involving the same dog. Upon a person being convicted of or pleading guilty to
a third violation of division (d) of this section involving the same dog, the
court shall require the offender to register the involved dog as a dangerous
dog.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In addition to the penalties prescribed in division (l)(2)A. of
this section, if a violation of division (d) of this section involves a

misdemeanor of the third degree on each subsequent offense. Additionally, the
court may order the offender to personally supervise the dangerous dog that the
offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to complete dog obedience
training, or to do both, and the court may order the offender to obtain
liability insurance pursuant to division (f) of this section. The court, in the
alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a licensed
veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at the
ownerâs expense. With respect to a violation of division (d) of this section
that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final determination and
during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of that division and at the
discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or restrained in
accordance with division (e) of this section or at the county dog pound at the

basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as

analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,

substances that are, the basis of the alleged violation preserved for the
benefit of independent analysis performed by a laboratory analyst employed by
the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused's attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result

this section shall consider any written policy that the seller has adopted and
implemented and that is intended to prevent violations of division (a) of this

seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:

license, commercial driverâs license, temporary instruction permit, or
nonresident operating privilege;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the offenderâs driverâs license, probationary driverâs
license, commercial driverâs license, temporary instruction permit, or
nonresident operating privilege has previously been suspended pursuant to
division (b)(2)A. of this section, or any other substantially equivalent state
or local law, impose a class seven suspension of the offenderâs license,
permit, or privilege from the range specified in R.C. Â§ 4510.02(A)(7), provided

knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the property has been
obtained through commission of a theft offense.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â It is not a defense to a charge of receiving stolen property in

672.03Â Â Â DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who
is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offenderâs same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses,
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section, âfair
market valueâ is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

Â Â Â As used in this chapter:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â "Dangerous offender" means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â "Repeat offender" means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:

defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in

(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02Â Â Â PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORCÂ 2929.21)
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Except as provided in Â§
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. Â§ 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. Â§ 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the courtâs consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the courtâs
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offenderâs jail sentence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.Â 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of

666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the courtâs own motion, the

division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator. one or more of the following penalties:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A more restrictive community control sanction;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. Â§ 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. Â§ 2925.12, R.C. Â§ 2925.14, or R.C. Â§ 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. Â§ 2925.11, or violated R.C. Â§ 2925.12, R.C. Â§ 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. Â§
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (d)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (d)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.

traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offenderâs crime or the victimâs estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victimâs representative, victimâs attorney, if

provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victimâs costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victimâs representative, victimâs attorney, if applicable, or victimâs estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victimâs estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. Â§ 3937.18.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The victim, victimâs attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victimâs estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. Â§ 2929.281(A).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and

section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in

addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in

pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. Â§ 111.48.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offenderâs criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. Â§
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. Â§ 2929.28)
698.03Â Â Â IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offenderâs service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offenderâs
commission of the offense or offenses;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â The offenderâs military service record.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, if the
offender enters an Alford plea, the sentencing court shall not consider whether
the offender showed genuine remorse for the offense.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section 698.02(a).
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Â§ 698.02(c), (d), (e), and
(f). A court may impose the longest jail term authorized under Â§ 698.02(b) only
upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon offenders
whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses demonstrate
that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter the offender
from committing a future criminal offense.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victimâs representative, the victimâs
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04Â Â Â ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand

Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05Â Â Â MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. Â§ 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21 or 4511.19, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a prison term
that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. Â§ 2903.06, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or
a felony violation of R.C. Â§ 2903.04 involving the operation of a vehicle by
the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution when the
trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When consecutive
jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or
more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this division, the term to be
served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender
shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before serving any term imposed for
a misdemeanor.

698.06Â Â Â MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
Â Â Â ( Editor's note: Section
698.06 was repealed as part of the 2003 updating and revision of this code of
ordinances because substantially equivalent State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was
repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07Â Â Â SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to Orwell Village
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â "Refundable credit" means the amount of Orwell Village income
tax that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If, in addition to Orwell Village, a taxpayer has paid tax to
other municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each
municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal
corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to Orwell
Village for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Domicile.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â An individual is presumed to be domiciled in Orwell
Village for all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in
Orwell Village on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
Orwell Village for all or part of the taxable year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described
in division (c)(1)A.1. of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in Orwell
Village for all or part of the taxable year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled
in Orwell Village for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The address on the individual's driver's license;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â The location of real estate for which the individual claimed a
property tax exemption or reduction allowed on the basis of the individual's
residence or domicile;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â The location and value of abodes owned or leased by the
individual;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 6.Â Â Â Declarations, written or oral, made by the individual
regarding the individual's residency;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 7.Â Â Â The primary location at which the individual is employed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 8.Â Â Â The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 9.Â Â Â The number of contact periods the individual has with Orwell
Village. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact
period" with Orwell Village if the individual is away overnight from the
individual's abode located outside of Orwell Village and while away overnight
from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal, of each of two
consecutive days in Orwell Village.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Businesses.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in Orwell Village, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides
in Orwell Village or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Ohio
R.C. Ch. 5745.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in division (d)(1)B. of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of Orwell Village shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in Orwell Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in Orwell Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all
of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the
taxable period to individuals employed in the business or profession for
services performed in Orwell Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation

profession, wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding
compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
880.04(b)(1);
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in Orwell
Village to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same
period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â If the apportionment factors described in division (d)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in Orwell Village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator
of Orwell Village may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Separate accounting;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â A modification of one or more of the factors.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
880.12(a).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (d)(1)B.1. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
880.12(a).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Nothing in division (d)(1)B. of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â As used in division (d)(1)A.2. of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to,
or under the possession of one of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The employer;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or
a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in division (d)(1)C.1.b. of this section, or a related member of such
a vendor, customer, client, or patient.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (d)(1)C.1. or 2. of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â For the purposes of division (d)(1)A.3. of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For
the purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in Orwell Village
if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the following
criteria:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â The property is shipped to or delivered within Orwell
Village from a stock of goods located within Orwell Village.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â The property is delivered within Orwell Village from a
location outside Orwell Village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within
Orwell Village and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The property is shipped from a place within Orwell Village
to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the taxpayer is
not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or
promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
Orwell Village to the extent that such services are performed in Orwell
Village.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in Orwell Village shall be sitused to Orwell Village.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents
and royalties from real property located in Orwell Village shall be sitused to
Orwell Village.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to Orwell Village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in Orwell Village.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to Orwell Village's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in Orwell Village or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of Orwell
Village. Orwell Village shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to Orwell Village, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in Orwell
Village to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real
estate everywhere in the taxable year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â An individual who is a resident of Orwell Village shall report
the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for Orwell Village. The individual may claim a credit for
taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation
to the extent that such a credit is allowed under Orwell Village's income tax
ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â When calculating the ratios described in division (d)(1)A. of
this section for the purposes of that division or division (d)(1)B. of this
section, the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios
the property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â If in computing adjusted federal taxable income, the taxpayer
deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an employee, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to Orwell Village. In no case shall a taxpayer
be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to Orwell Village any
amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay
tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.

Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Withholding provisions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in Orwell Village shall withhold an income tax from the
qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in Orwell Village.
Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
880.03 or division (a)(2)D. or F. of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
880.03, of 1.5%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct
and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer,
agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the
qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the
employee.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of Orwell Village the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of Orwell Village in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if
the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of Orwell Village in any month of the preceding calendar
quarter exceeded $200.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Payment under division (a)(2)A.1. of this section shall be
made so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than 15
days after the last day of each month for which the tax was withheld.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not
required to make payments under division (a)(2)A.1. of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the 15th day of the month following the end of
each calendar quarter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Intentionally left blank.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment may be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of Orwell Village. The payment of tax
by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and Orwell Village as the
return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Orwell Village income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to Orwell Village the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to a
Orwell Village income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent
the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â G.Â Â Â Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for Orwell Village until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â H.Â Â Â On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for Orwell Village during the preceding calendar year;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax
was withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the
preceding calendar yea;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Any other information required for federal income tax
reporting purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form
with respect to such employee;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I.Â Â Â The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with
the responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â J.Â Â Â An employer is required to deduct and withhold Orwell Village
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â K.Â Â Â The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Entrant - Withholding.

employee spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (b)(1)B.1.a. of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair
and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with
division (b)(1)B.2. of this section, except that "location" shall be

wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in Orwell
Village if the employee performed such services in Orwell Village on 20 or

the time the services commence:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â i.Â Â Â The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ii.Â Â Â The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â The employee is a resident of Orwell Village and has
requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
880.04.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â For the purposes of division (b)(1)B.1. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in Orwell
Village only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in Orwell Village than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Transporting or delivering property described in division
(b)(1)B.2.c. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â e.Â Â Â Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (b)(1)B.1. of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Except as provided in division (b)(1)D.2. of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in Orwell Village exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer
shall withhold and remit tax to Orwell Village for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in Orwell Village.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â An employer required to begin withholding tax for Orwell
Village under division (b)(1)D.1. of this section may elect to withhold tax for
Orwell Village for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in Orwell Village.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â If an employer's fixed location is Orwell Village and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
880.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to
Orwell Village, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of Orwell Village.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer
for a taxable year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â F.Â Â Â Divisions (b)(1)B.1. and D. of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
880.04.
(Ord. 15-12-02. Passed 12-29-15.)
880.05Â Â Â ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â An annual Orwell Village income tax return shall be completed
and filed by every individual taxpayer 18 years of age or older and any
taxpayer that is not an individual for each taxable year for which the taxpayer
is subject to the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers and resident a return filed by an employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer under Section
880.05 of this chapter when the nonresident or resident individual taxpayer's
sole income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Orwell Village
income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from
which retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the Orwell Village, at which time
the retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â All resident and individual taxpayers 18 years of age and older,
shall file an annual return municipal income tax return with the municipality,
regardless of income or liability.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by Orwell Village, the return or notice required of that individual
shall be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent,
guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the
person or property of that individual.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Orwell Village shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040; and,
with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation necessary to
support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who
files the annual return required by this section electronically is not required
to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless
the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the return has been filed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual
net profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some
other manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to
the Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is
available, submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business
Gateway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by Orwell Village to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, each return
required to be filed under this section shall be completed and filed as
required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date prescribed for the
filing of state individual income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G). The
taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by
the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with remittance made
payable to Orwell Village. No remittance is required if the net amount s due is
ten dollars or less.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of Orwell Village's income
tax return. The extended due date of Orwell Village's income tax return shall
be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is
not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator
grants an extension of that date.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of Orwell Village's income tax return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's Orwell Village income tax return. If the request is
received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the Orwell Village
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Orwell Village's income
tax return. The extended due date of Orwell Village's income tax return shall
be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by Orwell Village, the Tax Administrator
may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as
provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file
annual returns.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â To the extent that any provision in this division (a)(7) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), (3)(c), or
(c)(4) of this section, the provisions in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), or
(c)(4) prevail.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â For taxable years beginning after 2015, Orwell Village shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net
amount due is ten dollars ($10) or less.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to Orwell Village for a
taxable year pursuant to division (a)(8)A. of this section shall file with
Orwell Village an annual net profit return under division (a)(6)C. of this
section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Taxes withheld for the Orwell Village by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
880.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by Orwell Village, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to Orwell Village and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â Each return required by Orwell Village to be filed in accordance
with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of
any income tax return, report, or document required by Orwell Village, provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by Orwell Village or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or
tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this chapter and of Orwell Village's ordinance, resolution, or
rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file Orwell
Village's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Orwell
Village for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension
of time for payment of taxes required by Orwell Village during the period of
the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The
application shall be filed on or before the 180th day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (c)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes
for the extension period.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (c)(3)B.1. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the president of the United States or an act of the congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division
(c)(3)B.1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (a)(7)B.1. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â For each taxable year to which division (c)(1), (c)(2), or (c)(3)
of this section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (c)(2)B. and
C. of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Consolidated Municipal Income Tax Return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â As used in this section:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (d)
(1)A. of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 4927.01.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â E.Â Â Â "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 5727.01.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to Orwell
Village's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (d)
(2)B of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (d)(2)A. of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â An election made under division (d)(2)A. or B. of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Orwell Village income tax return for that taxable year if
the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to Orwell Village. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated Orwell Village income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Orwell Village income tax return for all subsequent taxable
years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the
Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Orwell Village income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States department of
treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in divisions (d)(5)B., C., and D.
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
880.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â No corporation filing a consolidated Orwell Village income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
880.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated Orwell Village income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (d)(1) through (8) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded,
the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (d)(1) through (8) of
this section, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included,
the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis
of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (d)(1) through (8) of
this section, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to Orwell Village;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The pass-through entity shall be subject to Orwell Village
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Corporations filing a consolidated Orwell Village income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (d)(1) through (8) of this
section by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Each corporation filing a consolidated Orwell Village income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by Orwell Village in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with Orwell Village before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with Orwell Village may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Every individual taxpayer domiciled in Orwell Village who is required
to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this ordinance may claim a
nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the other
municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall not
exceed the tax due Orwell Village under this chapter; and if the paid tax to
another municipality is less than the tax imposed by this chapter, then the
taxpayer domiciled in the village shall pay and be liable for the difference
between tax paid to the other municipality and the tax due to the village.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Orwell Village shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a

created under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district
created under Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â As used in this section:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for Orwell Village's income tax
for the current taxable year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to Orwell Village for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Taxes withheld for Orwell Village from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the Orwell Village in equal amounts on each payment date
unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually
withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which
the amounts were actually withheld.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in
which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic funds
transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division, "date of
the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months

date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under Section
880.05(a)(7) or on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to Orwell Village,
including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â On or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 22.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â On or before the 15th day of the sixth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â On or before the 15th day of the ninth month after the beginning

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â On or before the 15th day of the first month of the following
taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â On or before the 15th day of the fourth month of the year following
that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an annual
return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid with the
return in accordance with Ohio R.C. 718.05.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
880.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â D.Â Â Â For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with Orwell Village under
Section
880.05 for that year.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The taxpayer is an individual who resides in Orwell Village but was
not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 15-12-02. Passed 12-29-15.)
880.09Â Â Â REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
880.18.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Overpayments of more than $10 or more;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10) or more.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (c)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
880.21.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
880.18(a)(4).
(Ord. 15-12-02. Passed 12-29-15.)
880.10Â Â Â SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Income tax that has been deposited with Orwell Village, but should
have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by Orwell Village
as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with Orwell Village is subject to recovery by Orwell
Village. If Orwell Village's tax on that income is imposed after the time
period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other
municipality, Orwell Village shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the tax
or withholding Orwell Village claims is due with respect to such income or
wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with
respect to such income or wages.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â If Orwell Village's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using Orwell
Village's tax rate. However, if Orwell Village's tax rate is greater than the
tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable
credit is to be paid to Orwell Village, along with any penalty and interest
that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 15-12-02. Passed 12-29-15.)
880.11Â Â Â AMENDED RETURNS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
Orwell Village changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal
or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
Orwell Village. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment
to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
880.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section
880.12(a)(1)A. for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10),
no refund need be paid by Orwell Village. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
880.09.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Orwell Village's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Orwell Village return showing income
subject to Orwell Village income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional Orwell
Village income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10) .

880.12Â Â Â LIMITATIONS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A.Â Â Â Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
880.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Ending the later of the 60th day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
880.09.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by Orwell Village does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
880.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section
880.09(e).
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â No civil action to recover Orwell Village income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:

imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
Â Â Â A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
Â Â Â This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 15-12-02. Passed 12-29-15.)
880.14Â Â Â SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â As used in this section:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056 is not able
to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for
non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A.Â Â Â If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known address, the
assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served. If the
ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable address, the
assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the assessment's postmark.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â Once the Tax Administrator or other Orwell Village official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (c)(1)A. of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee's business.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Orwell Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.

to Orwell Village that arises pursuant to Orwell Village's income tax imposed
in accordance with this chapter.

municipal corporation:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Compromise a claim;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.

hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of Orwell Village as

furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax

law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or

Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Verification of Accuracy of Returns and Determination of Liability.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return

the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal

Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by Orwell Village or for the withholding of such tax.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to

the request was directed pursuant to Section
880.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
880.99.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â B.Â Â Â If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide

respect to that information as required under Section
880.19(c) within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
880.18.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â C.Â Â Â The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
880.99 for a violation of Section
880.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by

received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only

power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax

Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax Review.
The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the
assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60
days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60

hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear

situated in the Village shall be liable for any water or other Village-owned
utility rental when said water or other utility is used in or upon the premises
belonging to or owned by such real estate owner. Every real estate owner is
liable for the water or other utility used upon such owner's real estate
premises, whether such water or utility is used by said land owner or by any
other person holding the property under said land owner.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The Clerk of the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs shall, upon any
water rental charge or utility charge remaining unpaid for a period of sixty
days, certify the amount of the unpaid utility charge to the Office of the

1040.02Â Â Â WATER AND SEWER TAPâIN DEPOSIT FEE FOR LAND RESTORATION.
Â Â Â In the case of a water, sanity sewer or storm sewer line tap, there is
hereby established a deposit in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) to
secure restoration of the lands disturbed by the construction of the tap. The
deposit shall be paid to the Village at the time the tap is applied for and the
tap fee is paid. If construction of the tap is completed and the lands restored
within thirty days of the start of construction, then the Village shall return
the deposit. However, if restoration is not completed within thirty days of the
start of construction, then the Village may retain the deposit and apply it to
the cost of restoration by the Village. Any deposit not used by the Village for
restoration shall be returned. The Water and Sewer Superintendent shall be the
inspector of the restoration and the sole determiner of the adequacy of such
restoration. (Ord. 94â11â1. Passed 11â15â94.)
1040.03Â Â Â WATER AND SANITARY SEWER TAPâIN FEES.

Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Premises located outside the corporate limits of the Village shall
be charged 140 percent of the above rates which would be applicable to such
premises if located within the Village limits.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The foregoing tap fees to be charged for connection to the water and
sanitary sewer lines of the Village do not include materials, which shall be
the responsibility of the owner of the premises seeking the connection. The
owner of the premises seeking a connection shall bear all costs of installing
the water and/or sanitary sewer service lines from the building to the water
and/or sanitary sewer main lines.
Â Â Â In addition, the owner shall pay an inspection fee of one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00) per connection. If the inspection consumes more than six
hours of the time of a designated employee of the Board of Trustees of Public
Affairs and/or is not during the regular hours of such employee, then the owner
shall pay an additional thirtyâfive dollars ($35.00) for each additional hour
and/or overtime hour of such employee. If materials are necessary to the
inspection, the owner shall pay for the cost of the materials.
Â Â Â All excavations for the connection must be done under the supervision of a
designated employee of the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs. If the water
and/or sanitary sewer main lines are damaged during the connection, then the
owner shall, at the owner's cost repair the damage to the main according to the
specifications provided by such employee.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The extension of an existing water line that has already been tapped
and connected to the water lines of the Village is exempt from the tap fees
imposed by this section if the extension is one inch or less in diameter, and
provided the extension is properly metered, does not significantly increase
usage of water, and does not serve an additional residence and/or building used
for business or commercial purposes.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â In the event the owner of the premises seeking connection to the water
or sanitary sewer lines of the Village fails to comply with the requirements
imposed by this section, or those imposed by the Water and Sewer Systems
Specifications Ordinance, then permission to tap shall be denied by the
Village.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â All tap fees for connection to the water and sanitary sewer lines of
the Village received pursuant to this section shall be deposited directly to
the Water Funds and Sanitary Sewer Fund immediately upon receipt thereof and
without the requirement of any further action by Council.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â All tap permits shall be valid only for a period of sixty days from
the date of application, unless an extension of time is granted by the Board of
Trustees of Public Affairs.

1040.04 WATER AND SEWER UTILITY BILLING PAYMENT PROCEDURE.
Â Â Â New rental utility customers will be required to provide an initial deposit
to be paid in cash as follows:
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â W/S Deposit Village Properties: $286.84 ($123.60 for water; $163.24
for sewer).
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â W/S Deposit Non-Village Properties: $401.56 ($173.04 for water;
$228.52 for sewer).
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Water sewer payment is due within thirty days from the date of the
bill.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Deposits shall increase by ten percent (10%) with all scheduled water
and sewer rate increase for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 hereinafter.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â All water/sewer payments may be made by cash, check, money order,
Mastercard or Discover credit/debit any business Monday through Friday from 8:
00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The payment may be placed in the Village drop box located
at the Village Hall, mailed to the Village Hall or paid online through the
Village website.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â In cases where check(s) are returned for non-sufficient funds, the
billed party will make payment in cash within seventy-two hours of
notification. Any charge by the issuing bank for non-sufficient funds will be
the responsibility of the billed party. Failure to pay the bill and the bank
charge where applicable, within the seventy-two hour time limit, will result in
immediate disconnect of utility services. As a consequence, for a non-
sufficient fund return, the billed party will be required to make the next two
billing cycle payments in cash. If the same billed party should ever have
another check returned for non-sufficient funds, that party will be placed on
cash only payment basis for an indefinite period.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â After the thirtieth day from the billing date, the customer will be
charged a ten percent (10%) late fee as indicated on the bill to include the
service disconnect date (if payment has not been received by that time) and
reconnection fee (if service has been disconnected).
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â To have service reconnected, the customer must pay in cash or credit/
debit card the outstanding balance owed, a ten percent (10%) late fee based on
the outstanding balance, the non-sufficient funds bank penalty where applicable
and a reconnection fee of fifty dollars ($50.00). Payments received after 2:00
p.m. will result in reconnection within one business day. Unpaid balances will
be assessed on the property of the registered owner as documented on the
Ashtabula County Auditor's website. Such assessments will be removed once
payment in full has been remitted. Property owners will be responsible for
unpaid utility service bills incurred by any tenant, past or present.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â With good reason as determined by the Village Manager, a bill may be
adjusted to a normal average usage figure for an unusual spike in usage and
will be granted only one time. However, filling of a swimming pool or excessive
outdoor watering or for any other impermissible use of services known to the
customer will not be considered for a billing adjustment. An adjustment may
only be applied toward a Village meter (not a private meter). Adjustments will
only be granted once within a five year period.

the lateral shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the Village
from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the
installation of the lateral.
Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â A separate and independent lateral shall be provided for every
building, except that, where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, then the
lateral from the front building may be extended to the rear building and each
building shall be considered a separate sewer connection and subject to the
charges provided for in subsection (b) hereof, and separately charged for water
and sewer.
Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Old laterals may be used in connection with new buildings only when
they are found, on examination and test by the Superintendent, to meet all
requirements of this chapter.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â All sanitary sewers and laterals within the Village shall be in
accordance with one of the following: extra strength cast iron soil pipe with
lead-caulked joints (latest ASTM Specification); Standard Strength Clay Pipe
(ASTM C-13) and Extra Strength Clay Pipe (ASTM C-200); Asbestos-cement
nonpressure sewer pipe, classes 1500 and 2400 (ASTM C-4281); or plastic sewer
pipe, 1,000 pound and 1,600 pound crushing strength (Commercial Standards, U.S.
Department of Commerce, #C.S. 228-61.)
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â The size and slope of the lateral shall be subject to the approval of
the Superintendent, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four
inches. The slope of such four-inch pipe shall be not less than one-eighth of
an inch per foot. The lowest inlet to said sanitary sewer later, however, must
not be less than eighteen inches above the top of the public sewer to which the
lateral is connected.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Whenever possible, the lateral shall be brought to the building at an
elevation below the basement floor. No lateral shall be laid parallel to or
within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby be weakened. The
depth shall be not less than forty-two inches to the top of the sewer pipe. The
lateral shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight alignment insofar as
possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and
fittings, and there shall be accessible clean outs properly placed at any
change of direction of more than forty-five degrees.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall
be lifted by approved artificial means and discharged to the building sewer.
Â Â Â (k)Â Â Â All excavations required for the installation of a lateral shall be
open trench work unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent. Pipe laying
and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM specifications, except
that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected. The inside
of every sewer after it is laid must be left smooth and clean throughout its
entire length, and be true to line and grade.
Â Â Â (l)Â Â Â Joints on cast iron pipe shall be either caulked joints with oakum or
hemp and lead or compression joints with pre-formed molded ring or collar.
Joints on clay pipe shall be compression or pressure type made of plasticized
polyvinylcholride resin with suitable inert fillers in accordance with ASTM
Specification C-425-66T. Joints on asbestos-cement pipe shall be asbestos-
cement pipe coupling sealed with suitable rubber sealing rings or gaskets in
accordance with ASTM Specification D-1869. Plastic pipe joints shall be made
with "O" ring method conforming to ASTM Specification C-443 or with a
chemically welded method using proper cleaning solvents, primer, pipe cement
and couplings.
Â Â Â When assembled and backfilled, the joint shall exert sufficient pressure on
the entire circumference of the joint surface so as to prevent the entrance of
roots and the infiltration of subsurface water. All joints between piping of
different material shall be made with suitable jointing material and methods as
approved by the Superintendent.
Â Â Â (m)Â Â Â The connection of a lateral into the public sewer shall be made at the
"Y" branch, if such branch is available at a suitable location. If the public
sewer is eight inches in diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch
is available, the owner shall, at his or her own expense, install a "Y" branch
in the public sewer at the location approved by the Superintendent. Where the
public sewer is greater than eight inches in diameter, and no properly located
"Y" branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer with a
compatible saddle installed at the owner's expense to receive the lateral, with
entry in the downstream direction at an angle. The invert of the lateral at the
point of connection shall be at an elevation at least one-half the pipe
diameter of the public sewer above the invert of said sewer. A smooth, neat
joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by
encasement in concrete.
Â Â Â (n)Â Â Â The applicant for the lateral sewer permit shall notify the
Superintendent when the lateral is ready for inspection and connection to the
public sewer. The connection shall be made by the applicant under the
supervision of the Superintendent or his or her representative.
Â Â Â (o)Â Â Â All excavations for lateral installation shall be adequately guarded
with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets,
sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the
work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the Village. (Ord. 252.
Passed 5-20-69.)
1044.04Â Â Â PROHIBITED DISCHARGES; GREASE, OIL AND SAND INTERCEPTORS; PRELIMINARY

drainage, cooling water or unpolluted industrial process water to any sanitary
sewer. Where existing roof drainage is not properly connected, the same shall
be replaced or repaired in accordance with this chapter.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Storm water and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to
such sewers as are specifically designated storm sewers, or to a natural outlet
approved by the Superintendent. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process
waters may be discharged, upon the approval of the Superintendent, to a storm
sewer or natural outlet.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Except as hereinafter provided, no person shall discharge or cause to
be discharged any of the following described waters or waste to any public

waters of the sewage treatment plant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Any waters or wastes containing suspended or settlable solids of
such character and quantity that unusual attention or expense is required to
handle such materials at the sewage treatment plant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Any noxious or malodorous gas or substance capable of creating a
public nuisance or hazard to life or of preventing entry into sewers for
maintenance and repair.
Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, of the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease or excessive amounts of any flammable wastes,
sand and other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent, and shall be so
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. All
such interceptors shall be in compliance with the Ohio Plumbing Code.
Â Â Â Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials
capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall

discharge of such waters or wastes. Plans, specifications and any other
pertinent information relating to proposed preliminary treatment or private
treatment facilities shall be submitted for the approval of Council, and
Council shall in turn submit such plans to the Ohio Department of Health as
required by law, and no construction of such facilities shall be commenced
until said approvals are obtained in writing.
Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Where preliminary treatment facilities or private treatment facilities
are provided for any waters or wastes, such facilities shall be maintained
continuously in satisfactory and effective operation, by the owner at his or
her own expense. The right to enter upon and inspect such preliminary treatment
facilities is reserved to the Village. The owner of such preliminary treatment
facilities shall be liable for any damage to the Village sanitary sewage
system. The owner shall maintain proper operating records and shall submit to
the Superintendent a monthly summary report of the character of the influent
and effluent, in such form as may be prescribed by the Village, in order to
show satisfactory performance of the treatment facilities.
Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property served
by a lateral carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control
manhole in the lateral to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of
the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely
located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the
Superintendent. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his or her own
expense, and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and accessible
at all times.
Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of water
and wastes to which reference is made in subsections (c) and (f) hereof shall
be determined in accordance with "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water
and Sewage" and shall be determined at the control manhole provided for in
subsection (h) hereof, or upon suitable samples taken at said control manhole.
In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole
shall be considered to be the nearest down-stream manhole in the public sewer
to the point at which the lateral is connected.
Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â No statement contained in this section shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Village and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the Village for treatment, subject to payment therefor by
the industrial concern.
(Ord. 252. Passed 5-20-69.)
1044.05Â Â Â INSTALLATION OF ADDITIONAL WATER METERS IN COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS.
Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Where a commercial establishment in the Village uses more than 20,000
gallons of water per quarter for four consecutive quarters for a certain
special purpose and none of the water used for such special purpose is directly
or indirectly drained into the sanitary sewer system, then the owner of such a
commercial establishment may apply to the Board of Trustees of Public Affairs
for permission to install on his or her premises a second water meter for the
measurement of the water used for the said special purpose. The readings of
this second water meter shall in no way be used to figure the sewer service
charge of such owner.
Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The second water meter shall be installed and inspected entirely at
the expense of the owner and may be removed by the Board, also at the owner's
expense, if the owner uses less than an average of 20,000 gallons per quarter
for four consecutive quarters.
Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Permission to install a second water meter for the purpose set out in
subsection (a) hereof or the order to remove the second water meter as set out
in subsection (b) hereof shall be issued by the Board according to this
