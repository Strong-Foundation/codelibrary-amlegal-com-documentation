EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and

(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a

provision prevail.

irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the

   (e)    All present employees and officers shall be paid longevity pay as of
their original appointment date as a full-time employee.
   (f)    Longevity pay shall not be considered as part of regular salary.
(Ord. 3295-24. Passed 5-8-24.)
161.09 BEREAVEMENT LEAVE.
   (a)   Bereavement pay shall be allowed for working days off (not to exceed

grandparents, brother, sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and grandchild.
Said allowance shall apply only in the event the employee attends the funeral
of the deceased relative.
   (b)   Leave of absence without pay is allowed for other funerals when
approved by the employee’s supervisor. (Ord. 2886-01. Passed 12-19-01.)
161.091 SICK LEAVE.
   (a)   Sick leave is time for which a full-time employee is compensated at
his or her regular rate when absent due to illness or another medically related
reason, such as a doctor’s appointment.
      (1)   Each full-time employee shall be entitled to four and six-tenths
(4.6) hours of sick leave for every eighty hours of completed service.
      (2)   Sick leave can be accumulated up to a maximum of nine hundred and
sixty (960) hours for conversions upon retirement. The smallest increment of
sick leave which may be used is one hour.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as to require the
appointing authority to approve the use of sick leave by an employee when the
appointing authority is reasonably certain that the employee was not ill or was
not absent for the other reasons permitted by this section. Examples of when
the appointing authority may not approve sick leave are: concerted use of sick
leave by an employee singly or in concert with others as a means of withholding
services; a chronic abuse of sick leave in an established pattern; or other
situations where past history and facts do not substantiate the legitimate use
of sick leave. The appointing authority may investigate all usage of sick leave
and may withhold full payment of said sick leave until the investigation is
completed.
      (4)   Should the appointing authority determine that an employee has not
used sick leave properly, payment may be denied and discipline imposed.
Employees who do not report for work due to sickness, and who have exhausted
their sick leave days, are subject to disciplinary action for being absent
without approved leave. The appointing authority is authorized to approve leave
without pay to employees in this situation where it is determined that such
action is in the best interest of the Village.
      (5)   New employees are eligible for sick leave after successful
completion of the probationary period of six months of employment. Seasonal
employees earn no sick leave benefits. Sick leave does not accumulate while an
employee is on suspension or any unpaid leave of absence in excess of one
month.
   (b)   (1)   Sick leave may be used for absence due to temporary disability
caused by illness, injury, pregnancy or for exposure to contagious or
communicable disease which may be transmitted to fellow employees. Any such
absence shall begin when the temporary disability or exposure shall be so
severe as to prohibit an employee from attendance at work and shall cease when
an employee is able to return to work.
      (2)   Although medical appointments are not encouraged during normal
business hours, two hours of paid sick leave may be granted provided the
employee provides some form of documentation from an accredited doctor’s or
dentist’s office stating the reason for such a visit to his or her supervisor
and notifying the Administrative Offices or Village Clerk.
   (c)   An employee absent on sick leave for more than three days shall submit
a claim for sick leave. For a sick leave absence of three days or less, the
appointing authority may require employees to furnish a claim for sick leave
form. Failure to submit the sick leave claim form when required will result in
the employee being determined to be on leave without pay and a deduction in the
subsequent payroll period. The claim form should be forwarded with the
employee’s time sheet.
   (d)   (1)   Employees seeking to use sick leave should call a supervisor two
hours prior to the regular starting time. Failure to do so may result in the
employee being counted as missing - no sick leave benefit will be paid and the
employee will be subject to disciplinary action.
      (2)   Any full-time employee who retires and meets the age and length of
service requirements of the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) or the
Police and Fire Pension Fund (PFPF), whichever is applicable, shall be paid a
sum of money equal to fifty percent (50%) of their accumulated unused sick
leave times their daily wage rate. The accumulated unused sick leave shall not
exceed nine hundred and sixty (960) hours. (Ord. 2886-01. Passed 12-19-01.)
      (3)   Half of any amount greater than nine hundred and sixty (960) hours
may be purchased by the Village on a yearly basis at the current rate of pay.
The hours are to be determined at the end of March and paid to the employee, at
the employee’s option, during April.
         (Ord. 2973-05. Passed 8-17-05.)
      (4)   At the employee’s option, payment for excess hours may be made in a
manner that, in the event the employee does not exercise a purchase of the
hours as set forth above, limits the employees tax liabilities. Examples:
transfers to tax deferred accounts, transfer to IRAS.
      (5)   This payment may also be made to an employee in any manner agreed
upon by the employee and the Village Clerk so that no additional costs are
incurred by the Village.
   (e)   Maternity leave will be considered under the Family and Medical Leave
Act.
   (f)   A leave of absence may be approved by the Council under the following
conditions:
      (1)   Leave of absence is always without pay.
      (2)   Leave of absence may only be granted to regular, full-time
employees who have successfully completed their probationary period.
      (3)   The request for a leave of absence must be in writing from the
employee outlining the reasons for the leave.
      (4)   On any approved leave of absence in excess of one month, the
employee shall pay the total premium cost for his medical and life insurance
for the duration of the leave. This cost is to be paid in advance of the first
month of the leave and prior to each month thereafter or the coverage will be
terminated.
      (5)   Failure to return from a leave of absence at the specified date
will be considered as a resignation.
      (6)   All approved leaves of absence shall be confirmed in writing to the
employee by the Chairman of Council with a copy of the employee’s file.
      (7)   Vacation and sick leave do not accrue on a leave of absence in
excess of one month. Vacation allowance is paid at the time of departure on the
amount unused and accrued. Any sick days accumulated prior to the leave may be
reinstated immediately upon return.
      (8)   Re-employment, if applicable, should be part, or the condition of,
the leave of absence. If not, the employee is subject to the availability of
employment at the time of his or her requested return. Employees returning from
military service are subject to the Veterans Re-employment Rights Act.
      (9)   There are several types of leaves of absence. They include:
         A.   Medical: Time away from the job because of accident or illness
not covered by sick leave.
         B.   Self improvement: Schooling.
         C.   Personal: Time needed to handle personal problems.
   (g)   Any absence from work which is not detailed in this section of these
Personnel Rules and Regulations shall be considered an unauthorized absence
from duty. Any such unauthorized absence from duty shall constitute just cause
for disciplinary action.
   (h)   The Village will provide eligible employees a leave of absence for
specific reasons and subject to guidelines as defined by the Family and Medical
Leave Act (FMLA). Eligible employees shall be provided up to twelve (12) weeks
of leave during any twelve month period in connection with specific qualifying
events. Employees must be restored to the position occupied when the leave
began or to an “equivalent position” with equivalent conditions of employment.

161.14 SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY.
   Note:   This rule or regulation is for internal use only, and does not

Discipline may be progressive in nature and shall be applied based upon a

      (1)   Department head disciplinary authority and responsibility.
Department heads may issue verbal warnings and written warnings to members of
their departments and should provide any documentation to the Council.
      (2)   Council disciplinary authority. The Council may enforce any of the
types of discipline, including termination, where appropriate and in accordance
with any applicable statutes or local laws.
      (3)   Employee notification.  
         A.   For disciplinary measures that are more severe than a verbal
warning, the disciplined employee will be informed in writing of the right to
appeal the disciplinary action to the Council.
         B.   The written order will be provided to the employee prior to the
effective time of the order for all disciplinary action.
   (d)   Appeal Procedure. Disciplinary actions need not be deferred pending
the possible submission of an appeal.
      (1)   Employee’s responsibility. Employees, with the exception of
Department Heads, feeling aggrieved by either a suspension of more than three
days or a change of status (e.g., dismissal or demotion) may, in writing,
appeal the disciplinary action to the Council.
         A.   The appeal must be filed in writing with the Village Clerk and
Council within ten days of the employee’s receipt date of written notification
of the disciplinary action from Council. If the ten day appeal filing time is
exceeded, Council will take no action in the matter. This appeal:
            1.   Must be signed by the individual who is appealing and include
both his or her department and grade therein; and
            2.   Must have attached thereto a copy of the disciplinary order.
         B.   The employee will present the written request for an appeal
hearing in dispassionate language and shall not vilify the character or
motivation of the Department Head or Council. The written request should
specify either or both of the following grounds for appeal:
            1.   There was a failure on the part of a Village official to
observe or correctly apply the provisions of the Personnel Rules or the terms
of the subject’s appointment; and/or
            2.   There was not a complete consideration of the facts regarding
the disciplinary action taken against the appellant.
         C.   The appeal hearing request should contain all written material
truly relevant to the case.
         D.   The Council will provide a copy of all material presented in the
request for an appeal hearing when it is filed.
         E.   Hearings will normally be closed to the public. However, the
appellant may request that it be open at the time he or she submits the written
appeal.
      (2)   Council responsibility and authority.  
         A.   The Council shall set a time for an appeal hearing promptly and
should strive to have the hearing date no later than ten days after receiving
the request for an appeals hearing.
         B.   The Council will review all written material submitted to it. If

measure taken against the employee.
      (3)   Police officers; discipline, termination, and right of appeal. Ohio
R.C. 737.171 and 737.19 govern the discipline and termination of the police
chief and police officers. As provided by Ohio R.C. 737.171 and 737.19, a
certified police officer may appeal a decision of Council for removal to the
Court of Common Pleas.
      (4)   Grievance procedure.
         A.   A grievance is defined as any cause of complaint or
dissatisfaction arising between the employer and employee regarding terms or
conditions of employment.
         B.   It is the policy of the Council that all employees have the right
to voice their complaints. We recognize the meaningful value and importance of
full discussion in resolving misunderstandings and preserving good relations
between management and our employees. It also protects the employer’s and
employee’s rights. Accordingly, we believe that the following procedure will
ensure that complaints receive full consideration.
      (5)   Procedure.
         A.   In the event the employee feels a problem remains unresolved
following discussions with the supervisor, the employee may submit the
complaint in writing for reconsideration. A Grievance Report is to be submitted
to the immediate supervisor, the Mayor, and the Department Head. Upon reviewing
the complaint, the Department Head should arrange a meeting with the employee
within three working days after receipt of the written complaint and return a
decision within seven days of the meeting. Normally, complaints will be
resolved at this step of the grievance procedure.
         B.   An employee who feels the complaint has not received adequate
attention in Step Two may direct the complaint to the Council. Such complaints
are to be made in writing within three days of receiving the answer provided.
The Council will review the complaint with the Department Head and arrange a
meeting with the employee within three (3) days of receiving the complaint. The
Council shall have final authority in all such grievances and appeals. All
other means should be exhausted prior to bringing a complaint to the Council.
      (6)   Right of Counsel. The employee/grievant shall have the right to
have a grievance counselor present at any of the steps, with the exception of
the preliminary step. However, in the interest of resolving the grievance, at
the earliest possible step of the grievance procedure, it may be beneficial
that other representatives not specifically designated, be in attendance.
Therefore, it is intended that either party may bring in additional
representatives to any meeting in the grievance procedure, but only upon
advance initial agreement among the parties specifically designated to attend.
      (7)   The Grievance Report. Grievances should be in writing in order to:
         A.   Reduce the possibility of conflicting decisions.
         B.   Reduce the number of arguments over facts.
         C.   Reduce the number of unfounded grievances.
         D.   Aid record keeping and grievance analysis.
   The Grievance report is used by the employee to report and describe the
grievance. The report should be completed with copies for the employee, the
employee’s personnel file, and the immediate supervisor. It must be completed
in full, dated and signed by the employee and presented to the immediate
supervisor who will distribute the copies. It is to be used only after a
meeting and verbal discussion with the immediate supervisor.
   (c)   Termination. At the time an employee is terminated, for whatever
reason, the following steps must be taken prior to receipt of final pay:
      (1)   Provide the Village Clerk with the proper forwarding address in
order to receive W-2 forms and any other pertinent information needed to file
the current year’s income tax returns.
      (2)   Turn in uniforms, tools, building keys, keys to Village offices
and/or any other Village property to his or her immediate supervisor. A receipt
will be issued to the employee for all property returned.
      (3)   Advise the Village Clerk as to the type of action desired with
regard to employee’s retirement plan. (Ord. 2897-02. Passed 1-2-02.)
161.17 TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY.
   The Village of McDonald is committed to providing an environment that
encourages the use of telecommunication equipment as an essential tool to
support the Village’s business, but not private or personal business. It is the
responsibility of each employee to ensure that this technology is used for
proper business purposes and in a manner that does not compromise the
confidentiality of proprietary or other sensitive information.
   (a)   Limit of Policy. The Telecommunications Policy shall apply to the use
of Village owned or leased telecommunications equipment used by Village

efficient use of the telecommunication equipment within the guidelines in the

set forth herein when using telecommunication equipment owned or leased by the
Village or supplied by the employee.

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by
the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

receipted as a Village of McDonald fee and disbursed at the end of each month
to the Village of McDonald. Overpayments in excess of five dollars ($5.00) will
be refunded by check to the payee.

bench warrant or other legal arrest, shall fail to explain his nonappearance to
the satisfaction of the Court. Such failure to appear or to explain a
nonappearance shall cause such person to be held in contempt of Court and shall
subject him to the penalty provided in Section
171.99.
(Ord. 2777-98. Passed 6-17-98.)
171.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a
misdemeanor in the fourth degree and shall be fined not more than two hundred

         (I)   The number of contact periods the individual has with this
Municipality. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one "contact

company, or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports
under Chapter 5745 of the ORC.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (f)(2) and (g) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of this Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in this Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (A)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in this Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.

         (B)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable

         (C)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in this
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the

      (2)   (A)   If the apportionment factors described in division (f)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in this Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of this Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with

            (ii)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the

            (iv)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (B)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
183.12(a).
         (C)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)(A) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
183.12 (A).
         (D)   Nothing in division (f)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (f)(1)(B) of this section, "wages, salaries,

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (C)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f)(3)(A) or (B) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

as provided in division (g) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
         (A)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For
the purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in this
Municipality if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of
the following criteria:
            (i)   The property is shipped to or delivered within this
Municipality from a stock of goods located within this Municipality.
            (ii)   The property is delivered within this Municipality from a
location outside this Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within this
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)   The property is shipped from a place within this
Municipality to purchasers outside this Municipality, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         (B)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
this Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in this
Municipality.
         (C)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in this Municipality shall be sitused to this
Municipality.
         (D)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in this Municipality shall be sitused to
this Municipality.
         (E)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to this Municipality based upon the extent to which
the tangible personal property is used in this Municipality.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to this Municipality's tax only if
the property generating the net profit is located in this Municipality or if
the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of this
Municipality. This Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (A)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to this Municipality, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in this
Municipality to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (B)   An individual who is a resident of this Municipality shall
report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for this Municipality. The individual may claim
a credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal
corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under this
Municipality's income tax ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (f)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (f)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)   Intentionally left blank.
      (9)    Intentionally left blank.
   (g)   (1)   As used in this division:
         (A)   "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (B)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (C)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
183.04, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services at that location.
         (D)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (g)(l)(D)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (g)(l)(D)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(f)(I) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (g)(2):
         (A)    For the purpose of division (f)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (B)    For the purpose of division (f)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (C)    For the purpose of division (f)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (f)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (f)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section
183.04.
         (Ord. 3289-23. Passed 12-26-23.)
183.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
Withholding provisions.
   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in this Municipality shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying
wages earned and/or received by each employee in this Municipality. Except for
qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under Section
183.03 or division (b)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
183.03 of this Chapter, of two percent (2%). An employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the
date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or
constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to
the benefit of, the employee.
   (b)   (1)    Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of this Municipality the greater of the income taxes deducted and
withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (A)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of this Municipality in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or
if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted
and withheld on behalf of this Municipality in any month of the preceding
calendar quarter exceeded $200.
   Payments under division (b)(1)(A) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for which
the tax was withheld.
         (B)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)(A) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (C)   Intentionally left blank.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of this Municipality. The payment of
tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator and this Municipality as
the return required of a non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the
tax under this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold Municipality income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (A)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (B)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to this Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to
Municipality income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for this Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (A)   The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for this Municipality during the preceding calendar year;
         (B)   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (C)   The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (D)   Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (E)   Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Municipality income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not

fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
      If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee
spent the "greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for
or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (c)(2)(A)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
      For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (c)(2)
(B) of this section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

section, an employer is not required to withhold Municipality income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in this Municipality if the employee performed such services in this
Municipality on 20 or fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the
following conditions applies:
            (i)   The employee's principal place of work is located in this
Municipality.
            (ii)   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in this Municipality. For the purposes of this division,
"presumed worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this Municipality at which the employer provides or provided
services that can reasonably be, or would have been, expected by the employer
to last more than 20 days in a calendar year. Services can "reasonably be
expected by the employer to last more than 20 days" if either of the following
applies at the time the services commence:
               (a)   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform the services at
the location for more than 20 days.

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages
as provided in Section
183.04.
            (iv)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (B)   For the purposes of division (c)(2)(A) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in this
Municipality only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in this Municipality than in any other municipal
corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an
employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing one or more
of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent at the
employee's principal place of work:
            (i)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

employer;
            (v)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)(A) of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (A)    Except as provided in division (c)(4)(B) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in this Municipality exceeds the 20-day threshold, the
employer shall withhold and remit tax to this Municipality for any subsequent
days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in this Municipality.
         (B)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for this
Municipality under division (c)(4)(A) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for this Municipality for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in this
Municipality.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is this Municipality and the
employer qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
183.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to this
Municipality, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked
outside the corporate boundaries of this Municipality.
   To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (c)(2)(A) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements

183.05  ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (a)   An annual Municipality income tax return shall be completed and filed
by every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to
the tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
   (b)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by this Municipality, the return or notice required of that individual
shall be completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent,
guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the
person or property of that individual.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed
and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (e)   This Municipality shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (f)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of the
following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2,
"Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's
federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040, or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit
return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner
shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by this Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (g)   (1)   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to this Municipality. No
remittance is required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
         (B)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day (15th) of the fourth month following the end of
the taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to this Municipality. No remittance is
required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of this Municipality's income
tax return. The extended due date of this Municipality's income tax return
shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year
to which the return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023,
the extended due date of this Municipality’s income tax return for a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the
last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time
to file under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due
unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (A)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of this Municipality's income tax return.
         (B)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Municipality income tax return.
If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the
Municipality income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of this
Municipality's income tax return. The extended due date of this Municipality's
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by this Municipality, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided
in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual
returns.
      (5)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (g)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
         If a tax administrator violates division (g)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (g)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (g)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (g)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (g)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (g) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, this Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net
amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to this Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with this
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (f)(3) of this section,
unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (A)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Municipality income tax
ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with this
Municipality for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)(g))
within this Municipality.
            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in this Municipality
and does not expect to be subject to the Municipality income tax for the
taxable year.
         (B)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within this Municipality. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the Village of McDonald, make any sales in the Village of
McDonald, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the Village of
McDonald during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax
levied by the Village of McDonald for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to
be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the Village
of McDonald income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall
sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (C)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (h)(3)(B)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax return for the
taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that conflicts
with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit change.
         (D)   Nothing in division (h)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (i)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving the payment.
   (j)   Taxes withheld for this Municipality by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
183.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by this Municipality, unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to this Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by this Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by this Municipality, provided
that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by this Municipality or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer
or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this Chapter and of this Municipality's ordinance, resolution, or
rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway. 
   (m)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file this
Municipality's income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or
extension for filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of
amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
 
Extension for service in or for the armed forces. 
   (n)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of this
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by this Municipality during the
period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter.
The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after
the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to this Municipality before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (o)(1) of this
division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (p)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (n) and (o) of this section.
      (2)    (A)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by this Municipality in accordance
with this Chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (p)(2)(A)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a
member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the president of
the United States or an act of the congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (B)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (p)
(2)(A) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(2)(A) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   
   (q)   For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (r)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (r)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (s)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to this
Municipality's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (s)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (s)(1) of this section.
   The election to discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax
return is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first taxable year
of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (s)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to this Municipality. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Municipality income tax return for all subsequent taxable
years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from the
Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated Municipality income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States department of

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
183.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
183.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (A)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
Section
183.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to this
Municipality. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (B)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
Section
183.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to this
Municipality. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (A)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (r) through (y) of
Section
183.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to this
Municipality;
         (B)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Municipality income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (r) through (y) of Section
183.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated Municipality income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by this Municipality in accordance with this
Chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with this Municipality before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with this Municipality may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 3289-23. Passed 12-26-23.)
183.06  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
    (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in this Municipality who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this Chapter may
claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the
other municipality. Subject to division (c) of this section, the credit shall
not exceed the tax due this Municipality under this Chapter.
   (b)   This Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of this Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation.
 
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.
 
   (d)   Intentionally left blank. (Ord. 3220-18. Passed 7-18-18.)

this section:
         (A)   Taxes withheld for this Municipality from qualifying wages shall
be considered as paid to the Municipality in equal amounts on each payment date
unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually
withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which
the amounts were actually withheld.
         (B)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section

this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (A)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (B)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;

percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
this Municipality under Section
183.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in this Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 3220-18. Passed 7-18-18.)
183.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document. (Ord. 3220-18. Passed 7-18-18.)
183.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
183.18.
   (b)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by this Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (c)    (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (c)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
183.21.
   (d)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
183.18(a)(4).
(Ord. 3220-18. Passed 7-18-18.)
183.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited with this Municipality, but should
have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by this
Municipality as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.
   (b)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with this Municipality is subject to recovery by this
Municipality. If this Municipality's tax on that income is imposed after the
time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other
municipality, this Municipality shall allow a nonrefundable credit against the
tax or withholding this Municipality claims is due with respect to such income
or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality with
respect to such income or wages.
   (c)   If this Municipality's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using this
Municipality's tax rate. However, if this Municipality's tax rate is greater
than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the
nonrefundable credit is to be paid to this Municipality, along with any penalty
and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 3220-18. Passed 7-18-18.)
183.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)    (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for this Municipality changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with this Municipality. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by
the Tax Administrator.
       (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
 
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
          (A)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
          (B)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
183.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)    (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (d) of this
Section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by this Municipality. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
183.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Municipality's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Municipality return showing income
subject to Municipality income tax based upon such final determination of
federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional
Municipality income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 3220-18. Passed 7-18-18.)
183.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   (A)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (B)    The time limit described in division (a)(1)(A) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (A)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
183.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (B)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth day
after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review is
either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
183.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by this Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
183.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (e) of Section
183.09.
   (e)   No civil action to recover Municipality income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 3220-18. Passed 7-18-18.)
183.13 AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 3220-18.
Passed 7-18-18.)
183.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
 
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (c)   (1)   (A)   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (B)   Once the Tax Administrator or other Municipality official, or
the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (c)(1)(A) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)(1)(A) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)    (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Municipality
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)(B) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 3220-18. Passed 7-18-18.)
183.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to this Municipality that arises pursuant to this Municipality's income tax
imposed in accordance with this Chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of this
Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 3220-18. Passed 7-18-18.)
 
183.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of this Municipality
as authorized by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the tax
commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit this Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 3220-18. Passed 7-18-18.)
183.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by this Municipality ordinance or
state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud this Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.

      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to

this Municipality to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be

Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and

         (B)   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
       (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by this Municipality or for the withholding of such
tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that

affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)    (A)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this Chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
183.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
183.99.
         (B)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (c) of Section 183.19
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
183.18.
         (C)   The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)(A) and (B) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
183.99 for a violation of Section
183.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law. (Ord. 3220-18. Passed 7-18-18.)

Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (c)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (d)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
   (e)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (f)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal. (Ord. 3220-18. Passed 7-18-18.)

members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of this Municipality,
but such appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with this Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
(which applies only to these two appointments) immediately preceding the date
of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the Mayor of this
Municipality. This member may be an employee of this Municipality, but may not
be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or
other similar official or an employee directly involved in municipal tax
matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)   The term for members of the Board of Tax Review shall be two years.
There is no limit on the number of terms that a member may serve if the member
is reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the
Mayor shall serve at the discretion of the administrative official.
      (3)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)   A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason, ceases to
meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall
resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax Review.
The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the
assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60
days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Tax Review's final determination as
provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (f)   The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.
(Ord. 3220-18. Passed 7-18-18.)
183.22 AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this Chapter prohibits the legislative authority of this
Municipality, or a Tax Administrator pursuant to authority granted to the Tax
Administrator by resolution or ordinance, to adopt rules to administer an
income tax imposed by this Municipality in accordance with this Chapter. Such
rules shall not conflict with or be inconsistent with any provision of this

this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that subsection.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the

vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee

the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(A)(2), (3), (4) and (5)
that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)

ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which

the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH HIGHWAYS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs or highway traffic signals shall be erected at all
intersections with such through highways by the Department of Transportation as
to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities as to highways
under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Where
two or more State routes that are through highways intersect and no highway
traffic signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation or by
local authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under the Director’s jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs
or removes a stop sign under this paragraph, the Director shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days
before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or highway
traffic signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices.
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no highway traffic signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.
Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a
vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on
the through highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or highway traffic
signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through highways, or may
designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection and shall erect like
signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right- of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.

the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.

device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official highway traffic signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of- way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)

combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person’s opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C.
3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, "emergency medical technician-intermediate" and
"emergency medical technician-paramedic" have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail     term and a term of house
arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with
both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may
impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)
            5.   In all cases, if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s
name, immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense for ninety days in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233 and impoundment of the license plates of
that vehicle for ninety days. (ORC 4511.193)
         C.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court

section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the thirty-day mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding the jail terms set forth in
Section
303.99, the additional jail term shall not exceed one year, and the cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed one year.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of electronically monitored house arrest with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the sixty-day
mandatory jail term. Notwithstanding the terms of imprisonment set forth in

felony of the third degree and shall be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
subsection (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section as a result of the conviction or guilty
plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in division (F)(2) of Ohio R.C.
4511.191.
      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may
sentence the offender to five consecutive days in jail and not less than
eighteen consecutive days of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with

As an alternative to the mandatory jail term of sixty consecutive days required
by subsection (h)(1)C.2. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under subsection (h) of
this section and if Ohio R.C. 4510.13 permits the court to grant limited
driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving privileges in

the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender must
display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in division (B) of Ohio R.C. 4503.231.
      (5)   If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order of criminal
forfeiture under this section is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or
(3) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other
penalty established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the
vehicle as determined by publications of the national auto dealers association.
The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be distributed in accordance with
division (C)(2) of that section.
      (6)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under subsection (h)

other penalties provided by law, may order restitution pursuant to Ohio R.C.
2929.18 or 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000)
for any economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct

offense that a subsequent violation of this section or an equivalent offense
that results in the death of another or the unlawful termination of another’s

have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or

and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.

of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be

or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating

Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

Municipality for purposes of this section.

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever

of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.

delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

to run until either of the following occurs:

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed

vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

purpose;

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

the other person’s consent.
   (b)   (1)   No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly cause
or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law. (ORC 2909.03)
541.03 CRIMINAL DAMAGING OR ENDANGERING.
   (a)   No person shall cause, or create a substantial risk of physical harm
to any property of another without the other person’s consent:
      (1)   Knowingly, by any means;
      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently

endangering, a misdemeanor if the property involved is not an aircraft, an
aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part or any other equipment or
implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an aircraft and if
the violation does not create a risk of physical harm to any person, and if the

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions
of Section
545.05 or
545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:
   (a)   A credit card;

secondhand smoke from smoking causes illness and disease including lung cancer,

legislature, pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 3794, to be a statewide
concern. Pursuant to Ohio Revised Code sections 3794.01 et seq., there is now a
uniform state-wide minimum standard to protect people from the health hazards
associated with exposure to secondhand smoke from smoking. Therefore, it is in
the best interests of public health that smoking be prohibited and/or
restricted on outdoor public property owned by or under the control of the
Village. It is the intent of this chapter to make air safer to breathe on all
property owned by or under the control of the Village by banning smoking
outdoors on all such property.
   (b)   The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to further
the purpose of protecting public health and shall prevail over any less
restrictive state or local laws or regulations. Nothing in this chapter shall
be construed to permit smoking where it is otherwise prohibited by other laws
or regulations including Ohio Revised Code sections 3794.01 et seq.
   (c)   Pursuant to Ohio Revised Code section 3794.05, the Village hereby
declares any public outdoor property, as defined herein, which is owned and/or

725.01 APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS.
   All provisions of this chapter shall apply to all applicants for conditional
zoning certificates for gas and oil well permits. Certain provisions shall also
apply to applicants for brine disposal site permits as specified in Section
725.29. The heirs, executors or assigns of any individual permittee, and the
successors and assigns of any firm, partnership, association or corporate
permittee are as fully bound by these provisions as the original permittee. All
references to gas and/or oil shall be understood to include any other
hydrocarbon products of such well drilling operations. (Ord. 2688-94. Passed
10-19-94.)
725.02 INTENT; AUTHORITY OF PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)   It is the intent of this chapter, in addition to prescribing minimum
standards, to make drilling as safe as possible within the Village, and also to
cause drilling activity to be carried on in those zoning districts where they
are specifically listed as a conditionally permitted use.
   (b)   The Village is aware of the difficulty in setting rigid rules as to
the areas to be included in any one unit. It is the intent of this chapter to
have property drilled, when reasonable and expedient in the Village's judgment,
on one permit encompassing all appropriate and compatible properties and to
prevent the withholding of permission by a landowner for the sole purpose of
later requesting individual permission to drill on the same lot or area.
   (c)   The Building/Zoning Inspector is herewith given full authority to
impose such requirements as he/she shall deem necessary to give full force and
effect to the intent as expressed in subsection (a) hereof. Each application
for a permit shall rest solely upon its merits and the prudent use of
discretion by the Building/Zoning Inspector.
   (d)   The Planning Commission shall evaluate each application for a permit
according to the procedures detailed in the Zoning Ordinance and Subdivision
Regulations of the Village of McDonald, Ohio. (Ord. 2688-94. Passed 10-19-94.)
725.03 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (a)   No person, corporation or other entity shall commence to drill a well
for gas, oil or other hydrocarbons or develop a site for deep well brine
injection within the corporate limits of the Village until such time as the
person has wholly complied with all provisions of this chapter and a
conditional zoning certificate has been granted by the Planning Commission.
This conditional zoning certificate will expire one (1) year after the date of
issue if actual on-site drilling has not begun. The Planning Commission may,
for good cause, grant an extension up to one (1) year, without holding a public
hearing. No well, or wells, shall begin production until compliance with all
provisions are certified by the Fire Chief and the Building/Zoning Inspector.
   (b)   No person shall be permitted to drill more than two (2) gas/oil wells
at any one time. Application for the third permit or any subsequent permits,
may be made upon completion of the drilling of the first, second and each
numerically subsequent well.
   (c)   No gas/oil well shall be drilled ln an area less than 40 contiguous
acres.
(Ord. 2688-94. Passed 10-19-94.)
725.04 PERMIT APPLICATION; FEE.
   Any person desiring to drill a well for gas or oil or develop a deep well
brine injection site within the corporate limits of the Village shall make
application for a conditional zoning certificate to the Planning Commission.
All requests for permits must be completed at the time of application. A fee of
four hundred dollars ($400.00) per well shall be paid at the time the
application is filed. No refund of any part of a permit fee shall be made to
any permit holder for a dry hole or for failure to exercise the privilege to
drill upon the site covered by the permit.
(Ord. 2688-94. Passed 10-19-94.)
725.05 PUBLIC HEARING.
   (a)   The Planning Commission will, before granting a conditional zoning
certificate, schedule a public hearing, the date and time of which shall be
established by the Planning Commission and shall cause all property owners and
residents within 500 feet of the well-head to be notified of such hearing, in
writing, all by regular mail and notice shall be given of such hearing by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in McDonald Village. The
notice must carry a map showing the specific location of the well. The public
hearing must occur not less than three weeks prior to the commencement of
drilling. It shall be sufficient notice to all of the residents of any one
residential unit to address notice to "Resident or Residents" at the mailing
address of the residential unit.
   (b)   In addition thereto, the developer shall notify the Building/Zoning
Inspector forty-eight hours prior to actual drilling.
   (c)   Compliance with the hearing provisions of this chapter shall be
mandatory conditions precedent to the commencement of drilling under the
permit.
   (d)   Drilling shall not commence until fifteen days after the granting of
conditional use permit to allow time for the Building/Zoning Inspector to
inspect the area.
(Ord. 2688-94. Passed 10-19-94.)
725.06 PERFORMANCE BOND.
   (a)   At the time of the application, every applicant shall deposit with the
Village a performance bond conditional upon compliance with this chapter. The
amount of the bond, not less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), will be set
by the Planning Commission upon issuance of the conditional zoning certificate.
   (b)   The bond shall not only be conditioned upon compliance by the
applicant, but also upon compliance with this chapter by any assignee and owner
of any permit granted hereunder, or any employee, contractor, subcontractor or
other party performing services in connection with any permit issued hereunder.
Bond shall be released when wells and tank batteries have been removed and
premises restored to pre-drilling conditions.
(Ord. 2688-94. Passed 10-19-94.)
725.07 DRILLING NEAR STRUCTURES; EXCEPTIONS.
   No drilling shall be permitted for gas or oil wells within 300 feet of
residential structures, mercantile buildings or any school, church, hospital,
theater or assembly hall, as the same are defined by the Ohio Revised Code,
regardless of the zone. In the case of particular installations where
compliance with the foregoing distance requirements may be a handicap to the
use of the property and where no undue hazard will be created, the Planning
Commission may, with waivers as required in Section
725.09, reduce the distance to not less than two hundred (200) feet. Any
reduction in distance must be based upon a consideration of the special
features such as topographical conditions, nature of occupancy and proximity of
buildings on the adjoining property, proximity of storage tanks, degree of fire
protection provided and the facilities available at fire departments to cope
with controlling liquid fires. The above features are not to be in any way
construed as a limitation of matters which the Planning Commission may
consider. The Planning Commission shall have the right to consider any and all
other special features it may consider important in determining whether or not
an undue hazard is created.
(Ord. 2688-94. Passed 10-19-94.)
725.08 CONSENT FROM PROPERTY OWNERS WITHIN 500 FEET.
   (a)   All applicants for a permit to drill for gas and/or oil ln
nonindustrial and industrial zoned areas in the Village shall be accompanied by
consents in writing of owners of sixty percent (60%) or more of the real estate
units located within a radius of 500 feet from the proposed drilling site. The
consents shall plainly state that the persons whose signatures are affixed
thereto do give their consent to the drilling of a well for gas or oil on the
site as proposed in the application for a drilling permit. Measurement for
determination of the distance of the aforesaid 500 feet shall be made from the
exact center of the hold that is to be drilled for the well. As used in this
section, the term "real estate unit" means a land area with a common ownership
irrespective as to how it may be divided among lots.
   (b)   In the event that the owner of any property abutting a proposed well
site:
      (1)   Has leased his property for drilling for gas or oil;
      (2)   Has signed and filed an application for a permit to drill for gas
or oil on his property, or his lessee, contractor or agent has signed and filed
the application;
      (3)   Has signed and delivered a written assent under Section
725.01  through to an application for a permit to drill a well for gas or oil;
or
      (4)   Has utilized his property by entering into a community lease or
agreement for drilling a well for gas or oil, if the well to which he has
assented or which is to be drilled under the community lease or agreement is to
be located nearer to his property than the well or proposed well site mentioned
in this section, then the owner shall not be permitted to object, but shall be
deemed to have given his written assent, under the provisions of this section,
to drilling a well for gas and/or oil on the proposed well site first mentioned
above.
   However, any owner who has united his property by entering into a community
lease or agreement as set forth in subsection (b)(4) of this section, shall not
share in any adjacent well production because of conflicting lease interests of
the real estate caused by the real estate being in more than one unitized area.
It is the expressed intention of this provision to prohibit an owner of
property from unitizing identical property under more than one community lease
or agreement.
(Ord. 2688-94. Passed 10-19-94.)
725.09 WAIVERS FROM OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS WITHIN 300 FEET.
   (a)   In addition to the consents required in Section
725.08, no drilling shall be permitted for gas and/or oil wells in any zone
within 300 feet of any building or structure of any nature unless written
waivers, as hereinafter provided for, accompany an application for a drilling
permit.
   (b)   The owners and occupants of any building or structures which are
located within 300 feet of the proposed well site must waive, in writing, the
distance set forth. The owners and occupants may waive down to a minimum
distance of 200 feet without the necessity of vacating or causing to be
vacated, any buildings or structures during drilling operations.
   (c)   The owners and occupants of any buildings or structures of any nature
may consent to drilling for gas and/or oil to a minimum distance of 100 feet to
the buildings or structures, but in these cases, the Planning Commission shall
consider special features affecting the application for a drilling permit, such
as a topographical condition nature of occupancy and proximity of buildings on
the abutting property, facilities available at the Fire Department to cope with
controlling liquid fires and such other matters as the Village shall deem
relevant to the application. Should the Planning Commission, upon considering
the special features, find that an undue hazard is created, then irrespective
of waivers being provided, as called for in this section. The Village may
refuse to issue a permit to drill. The denial of the permit and the undue
hazard created shall be recorded in the minutes of the Planning Commission.
   (d)   Where the owners and occupants of any buildings or structures, which
are closer than 200 feet to a proposed drilling site have, at any time, waived,
in writing, the distance requirement provided in this section for any proposed
drilling site which was closer than 300 feet to the building or structures,
then the property owners shall be deemed to have waived the distance
requirement provided for in this section down to the same distance that the
party waived for the other proposed drilling site or to the distance that a
well actually drilled, whichever is smaller.
   (e)   All distances, as set forth in this section, shall be those distances
as measured from the exact center of a proposed drilling site. (Ord. 2688-94.
Passed 10-19-94.)
725.10 PLOT PLAN AND VICINITY MAP.
   Each application for a drilling permit must be accompanied by a plot plan
and vicinity map of the area involved in this application drawn to scale and
showing thereon:

the time the application is filed. No refund of any part of a permit shall be
made to any permit holder for a dry hole or for failure to exercise the
privilege to drill upon the site covered by the permit.
   (g)   All permittees shall use care at a drilling site to keep the area
around the drilling site free of mud which will be carried on the public
streets by any vehicle or other equipment used at the drilling site. Should any
mud be carried on public streets from a drilling site, the permittee shall be
required to clean up the streets to the satisfaction of the Village
Administrator at no cost to the Village. The Village Administrator shall have
authority to request a permittee to clean up the public streets to the
satisfaction of the Village Administrator, or failure to take specific steps to
reduce mud at a given location as required by the Village Administrator shall
be grounds for revocation of a permit and/or forfeiture of the bond posted
under subsection (f) hereof.
   (h)   The permittee shall restore the street, sidewalks and other public
places of the Village, damaged or destroyed in the operations of drilling or
preparing to drill, to their former conditions immediately upon completion of

925.04 BACKFLOW PROTECTION.
   (a)   Cross-Connection Control - General Policy.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of these Rules and Regulations is:
         A.   To protect the public potable water supply from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the consumer's water system contaminants or
pollutants which could backflow through the service connection into the public
water system.
         B.   To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-
connections, actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable
water system and non-potable water systems, plumbing fixtures and sources or
systems containing process fluids.
         C.   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of
backflow prevention and cross-connection control which will systematically and
effectively prevent the contamination or pollution of the public and consumer's
potable water systems.
      (2)   Application. These Rules and Regulations shall apply to all
premises served by the public water system of the Village of McDonald, Ohio.
      (3)   Policy. The Village Administrator shall be responsible for the
protection of the public water system from contamination due to backflow of
contaminants through the water service connection. If, in the judgment of the
Village Administrator, an approved backflow prevention assembly is necessary at
the water service connection to any consumer's premises for the safety of the
water system, the Village Administrator or his authorized representative shall
give notice to the consumer to install such approved backflow prevention
assembly at each service connection to his premises. The consumer shall
immediately install such approved assembly or assemblies at his own expense,
and failure, refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to install such
assembly or assemblies immediately shall constitute grounds for discontinuing
water service to the premises until such assemblies have been installed.
   (b)   Definitions. The following definitions shall apply in the

preventer that is installed in a consumer's water system that is intended to
contain the water within the premises to prevent any polluted or contaminated
water from backflowing into the public water system. Typically the containment
principle backflow preventer is placed at the service connection, unless
placement is otherwise specified by rule herein.
      (9)   "Contamination" means an impairment of the quality of the water by
sewage or process fluid or waste to a degree which could create an actual
hazard to the public health through poisoning or through spread of disease by
exposure.
      (10)   "Cross-connection" means any arrangement whereby backflow can
occur.
      (11)   "Degree of hazard" is a term derived from an evaluation of the

      (13)   "Double check valve assembly" means an assembly composed of two
single, independently acting, check valves including tightly closing shutoff
valves located at each end of the assembly and suitable connections for testing
the water-tightness of each check valve.
      (14)   "Health hazard" means any condition, device, or practice in a
water system or its operation that creates, or may create, a danger to health
and well-being of users. The word "severe" as used to qualify "health hazard"
means a hazard to the health of the user that could reasonably be expected to
result in significant morbidity or death.

private corporation, individual, partnership, or other legal entity.
      (18)   "Pollution" means the presence in water of any foreign substance
that tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a hazard or impair the
usefulness or quality of the water to a degree which does not create an actual
hazard to the public health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect
such waters for domestic use.
      (19)   "Potable water" means water which is satisfactory for drinking,
culinary, and domestic purposes and meets the requirements of the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.
      (20)   "Premises" means any building, structure, dwelling or area
containing plumbing or piping supplied from a public water system.
      (21)   "Process fluids" means any fluid or solution which may be
chemically, biologically or otherwise contaminated or polluted in a form or
concentration such as would constitute a health, pollutional, or system hazard
if introduced into the public or a potable consumer's water system. This
includes, but is not limited to:
         a.   Polluted or contaminated waters;
         b.   Process waters;

1109.01 ZONING INSPECTOR; BUILDING PERMIT.
   The position of Zoning Inspector is hereby created. The Inspector and such
assistants as may be determined necessary, shall be appointed by the Mayor and
shall receive such compensation as Council may provide. The Inspector shall
keep records of all applications for zoning certificates and the action taken
thereon.
   Before constructing, locating, changing the use of or altering any
buildings, including accessory buildings or changing the use of any premises,
including fences, swimming pools and satellite receiving equipment, application
shall be made to the Zoning Inspector's office for a preconstruction permit.
The application shall indicate the exact location of the proposed construction,
alteration or change of use and shall include a plot plan, plans and
specifications showing proposed locations and dimensions, of the building and
the proposed use, and shall include a fee as shall be established by Council to
cover the cost of processing the application, all of which shall be included in
the permanent record of applications.
   Within ten days after receipt of the application for a preconstruction
permit, the Zoning Inspector shall either issue a building permit if the
proposed construction, alteration or change of use by the application is deemed
in accordance with the Zoning Code and is accompanied by the proper building
fee, as set by Council, or shall refuse to issue a building permit if the
application does not comply with the requirements of the Building Code.
   Should the Zoning Inspector issue a building permit, the preconstruction fee
shall be deducted from the building permit fee.
   Should the Zoning Inspector determine the proposed construction, alteration
or change of use application is not in accordance with the Building Code and
refuses to issue a building permit, the Zoning Inspector shall so inform the
applicant in writing of his decision with the information that within twenty
days from receipt of the decision by the Zoning Inspector, the applicant has
the right to file a written appeal of the Zoning Inspector's decision with the
Board of Zoning Appeals, which shall set a date to hear such appeal.
   In the event of an emergency, including fire, windstorm, flood or other act
destroying totally or partially a dwelling house, building or other structure,
making it uninhabitable or unusable, the zoning regulations herein may be
temporarily suspended insofar as they may apply, at the discretion of the
Inspector, by permitting a temporary structure to be used in the place of the
destroyed building while it is being repaired or replaced. Under such
conditions the Inspector may permit the use of tents, trailers or building for
a six-month period.
   A building permit when obtained by an applicant shall not be transferred to
another person or to another property and the fee paid therefor shall be
nonrefundable.
   A building permit shall expire at the end of three hundred sixty-five days
from the date such permit is picked up by the applicant, and unless
construction, location, change in use of or alteration of any building or
premises is commenced within sixty days, a new application for another building
permit must be made to the Inspector. For any renewal, reconstruction,
enlargement or other change of any nonconforming use, the owner of the premises
must make an application to the Inspector for a building permit. 
   It shall be the sole responsibility of the record owner of the real estate
to secure any permit required in this Zoning Ordinance, regardless of any
private contract, lease or agreement to the contrary. Enforcement of this
Ordinance shall be against the record owner of the real estate.

maintain or use any building or land within the Village without first securing
a building permit as provided herein shall be required to pay twice the fees as
provided above prior to the issuance of any such building permit. (Ord. 2696-

   (a)    It shall be unlawful to use or occupy or permit the use or occupancy
of any building or premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter created,
erected, changed, converted or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use
or structure until a Certificate of Occupancy shall have been issued therefor
by the Zoning Inspector stating that the proposed use of the building or land
conforms to the requirements of all ordinances. Such Certificate of Occupancy
shall not be issued until water and sewer connections have been approved by the
Village Administrator.

amendment thereto, Council, the prosecuting attorney of the County, the Zoning

uses and permitted in all IA Districts:
Any use permitted in an RA District, RB District, CA District or a CB District.

except where the lot is abutting an RA or RB District, where there shall be a
minimum rear yard setback of 50 feet.

of the abutting property line.
   (c)   On residential lots having a frontage of fifty feet or less, no fence
or wall shall be constructed or placed in a side yard closer than two feet to

   (a)    Every pool heretofore or hereafter constructed shall have erected
around it a barrier or fence which shall be of rigid construction and which
shall be not less than four feet and not over six feet in height; shall extend

contain, except for gates, no openings larger than six inches square. Gates
shall be securely locked when such pool is not in use by the owner thereof, or
anyone using the same with his permission. If, in the opinion of the Zoning
Inspector, the aboveground pool has, by reason of its construction, a barrier
not less than four feet in height, which provides the required safety to
children and restricts access to the pool, the fence required by this section
may be waived.
If a pool structure is less than four feet aboveground, it shall be deemed to
be a permanent in ground pool. (Ord. 2696-95. Passed 1-4-95.)
1137.03 PERMIT REQUIRED; FEE.

Village, the owner or person authorized in his or her behalf, shall first
receive a permit authorizing the construction or installation of the fence from
the Building Inspector. A fee pursuant to the schedule found in Section
1113.02(e) shall be required before any permit is issued.
   Council shall be the authority to adjust the fees for fence permits from
time to time in order to insure that the cost of administering the fence
ordinance is defrayed to the fence permit applicant. The Board of Zoning
Appeals, in accordance with their rules of procedure, shall hear and decide
appeals arising out of the enforcement of this chapter.

lot, parcel or tract of land so sold. The description of such lot, parcel, or
tract by metes and bounds in the deed or transfer shall not serve to exempt the
seller from the forfeiture provided in this section.
   Any person who disposes of, offers for sale or leases for a time exceeding
five years any lot or any part of a lot in a subdivision before provisions of
these Regulations are complied with, shall forfeit and pay the sum of not less
than ten dollars ($10.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each
lot or part of a lot so sold, offered for sale or leased, to be recovered with
cost in a civil action, in the name of the Village Treasurer for the use of the
Village.

1161.01 CONFORMANCE; PRESERVATION.
   (a)   The arrangement, character, extent, width and location of major,
secondary and minor streets or highways shall conform with the provisions of
these Regulations. Streets shall conform to the recommendations of the Planning
Commission based on existing and planned streets, topography, public safety and
convenience, and proposed use of land.
   (b)   The subdivider shall furnish one hundred percent (100%) bond for the
ultimate installation of the improvements listed and described in these
Regulations. All of the required improvements shall be made in full compliance
with the specifications for each of the various units of work, as required by
the Village and County.
   (c)    Due regard shall be shown for the preservation of existing natural
features, distinctive site characteristics, outstanding scenic, cultural or
historic areas and all such features shall be integrated into the plan to
create functional variations in the neighborhood and more attractive building
sites.
(Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1161.02 ROUGH GRADING.
   Each block of subdivision, or part thereof, shall be planned and graded so
that the surface water of each lot will not be discharged onto adjoining lots
and will drain into a storm sewer system. Where necessary, grading may be
extended into lot areas to provide suitable house sites. Topsoil shall be
stripped from all graded areas and replaced to a depth of four inches after
completion. Tree lawns, turf gutters and other graded areas shall be
fertilized, seeded and mulched to assure proper growth of the turf. Newly
graded areas shall be otherwise protected against erosion and siltation by
artificial means where necessary.
(Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1161.03 STREETS.
   (a)    Design and Arrangement. The arrangement of streets in new
subdivisions shall make provision for the continuation of the principal
existing streets in adjoining areas or their proper projection where adjoining
land is not subdivided, insofar as they may be deemed necessary for public
requirements.
   The street arrangement shall be such as to not cause hardship to owners of
adjoining property when they plat their own land and seek to provide for
convenient access to it. Residential streets shall be so designed as to
discourage through traffic, but offset streets should be avoided except as they
are separated by not less than 400 feet at their access points on a collector
street.
   All streets and thoroughfares shall be graded to their full width, including
side slopes and improved in accordance with the standards outlined or referred
to in these Regulations. Plans and specifications for street improvements shall
be subject to approval by the Planning Commission and the Village Engineer.
      (1)    Street improvements. The approved Village standard typical
sections for local and collector streets are designed for normal traffic flow.
If the streets are providing access to a commercial or industrial park, and if
the heavy truck traffic will be continuous, the Commission and Village Engineer
will revise the thickness of the pavement typical sections to conform to the
anticipated traffic and axle loads.
      (2)    Subgrade. The subgrade shall be free of sod, vegetation matter,
trees and stumps and other similar matter. Adequate drainage of the subgrade
during construction must be maintained at all times. The subgrade shall be
prepared in accordance with the Department of Highways, State of Ohio, current
Construction and Material Specifications, Item 203, Roadway, Excavation and
Embankment.
The angle of intersection between minor streets and major streets should not
vary by more than ten degrees from a right angle. All other streets should
intersect each other as near to a right angle a possible, and no intersection
of streets shall be permitted at angles of less than seventy degrees.
Residential streets shall be designed to discourage through traffic which may
otherwise use secondary or major highways, and whose origin and destination are
not within the subdivision. Residential streets extending for considerable
distance, parallel to any secondary or major street, should be avoided.
Streets planned to serve multi-family, business or industrial areas shall
connect directly to major or collector streets, so as to not generate large
volumes of traffic on local residential streets.
The minimum curb radius shall be twenty-five feet to the face of the curb.
      (3)    Width of pavement. The width of pavement will vary, depending upon
the character of the development served and the amount of traffic expected to
utilize the street. The following are the minimum street pavement widths, which
widths include provision for parking lanes as may be required.
 
Type of Street               Minimum Pavement Width
Major street and highways    Variable *
Collector street             28 ft. - 36 ft.
Residential or local streets 25 ft. - 28 ft.
Alleys                       18 ft.
*(See Major Thoroughfare Plan) To conform to applicable cross-section as
established by proposed traffic and soil conditions and approved by the
Commission and the Village Engineer or the authority having jurisdiction.
In certain instances, especially where a commercial area is involved and no
off-street parking facilities are provided and no parking is permitted on the
street at any time, a parking lane at least eight feet wide on each side of the
street and paved to the satisfaction of and in accordance with the
specifications approved by the Village Engineer may be required in additions to
the necessary number of lanes for moving traffic.
Where pavement widths greater than those specified above are necessary,
provisions for same shall be discussed with public officials having
jurisdiction over the planning and construction of public ways to determine
whether or not public expenditures for such additional width can or should be
made simultaneously with the subdivider's improvement program.
      (4)    Base course. The base course shall be either 301, 303, 304, or 310
and as set forth on the Village of McDonald Approved Typical Section Standard
Drawings.
      (5)   Surface course - asphaltic concrete. The surface course shall be
constructed of Item 404, State of Ohio, current Standard Construction and
Material Specifications, and as set forth on the approved Village typical
section standard drawings.
 
Type of Street               Minimum Compacted Thickness of Surface Course
Major streets and highways   Variable*
Collector streets            2-1/2"
Residential or local streets 2-1/2"
Alleys                       2-1/2"
* To be approved by the Commission and Village Engineer or authority having
jurisdiction.
      (6)   Concrete pavement. The concrete pavement shall be constructed of
Item 452, State of Ohio, current Standard Construction and Material
Specifications, and as set forth on the approved Village typical section
standard drawings and miscellaneous standard drawings regardless joints, etc.
      (7)   Curbs. Curbs shall be required on all streets. Size and type will
be in accordance with the approved Village typical section standard drawings
and constructed in accordance with Item 609, State of Ohio, current Standard
Construction and Material Specifications.
      (8)   Sidewalks. Concrete sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of
the street and shall have a minimum width of five feet and a minimum thickness
of four inches. They shall be constructed of material approved by the Village
Administrator to provide for the safety of pedestrians in walking to schools or
other similar major destinations. Concrete sidewalks shall be constructed in
conformance with the current “Construction and Materials Specifications” of the
Department of Highways, State of Ohio, as they pertain to this type of
improvement; they shall conform to the approved Village typical section
standard drawings and constructed in accordance with Item 608.
      (9)   Drainage. All necessary facilities, including underground pipe,
inlets and catch basins, as determined by the Village Engineer, shall be
installed to provide for the adequate disposal of subsurface and surface water
and maintenance of natural drainage courses. All storm facilities within the
subdivision shall connect to an adequate drainage course.
      (10)   Storm sewers and storm water drainage. A drainage system adequate
to serve the needs of the proposed new streets and the entire subdivision will
be required in new subdivisions. Calculations for the total drainage area in
which the proposed subdivision will be located will be required by the Village
Engineer so as to assure adequate sizing of the pipe to transport the
storm drainage to an approved outlet. Where an adequate public storm sewer main
is available at the plat boundary, the subdivider shall construct a storm sewer
system and connect with such storm sewer main of adequate size. If such storm
sewer systems are not accessible, adequate storm sewers shall be provided with
easements of adequate width, as determined by the Village Engineer and approved
by the Planning Commission.
When storm sewers cross land not in the dedicated street right-of-way, an
appropriate easement shall be given to the Village for such drainage purposes.
Consideration should be given to lowering the depth of the storm sewer to allow
footer and interceptor drainage in areas of high water table.
A drainage system including turf gutters, culverts, pipes, manholes, catch
basins and drain inlets shall be provided as required by the Commission and the
Village Engineer. Storm drainage, including drain tile around basements, shall
not be permitted to discharge into any sanitary sewage facility. Where a public
storm sewer is reasonably accessible and of adequate capacity, as determined by
the Commission, the developer shall make the proper connection to such storm
sewer system and shall do such grading and provide such drainage structures as
may be required.
      (11)    Culverts and bridges. When natural drainage channels intersect
any street right-of-way, it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to
have satisfactory bridges and culverts designed and constructed. Where culverts
are required, the following minimum requirements shall be observed:
All culverts shall extend across the entire right-of-way width of proposed
road. The cover over the culvert and its capacity shall be determined by the
Village Engineer and at the expense of the subdivider. The minimum diameter of
a culvert pipe shall be eighteen inches. Head walls, depending on existing
drainage conditions, may be required.
The construction of storm water drainage improvements shall be subject to the
approval of the Planning Commission and the Village Engineer.
      (12)   Public water supply. The subdivider or developer shall observe all
the requirements as set forth by local ordinance, requiring connections to the
public water supply.
      (13)    Private wells. Individual private wells shall be constructed to
specifications of County Board of Health.
All abandoned wells shall be sealed in a manner that will render them
watertight.
In all cases a public water distribution system shall be required.
      (14)    Sanitary sewers. If a subdivision can be reasonably served by the
extension of an existing public sanitary sewer, as determined by the Village
Engineer, the subdivider shall provide a system of sanitary sewer mains and
shall provide lateral connections for each lot.
      (15)    Utilities. Electrical service, gas mains and other utilities
shall be provided underground within each subdivision. Whenever such facilities
are reasonable, accessible and available, they may be required to be installed
within the area prior to the approval of the final plat. Trees when planted
within the street right-of-way must meet the approval of the Park and
Recreation Committee with regard to location and types of trees.
      (16)    Inspection. Inspection shall be required for all improvements as
shown on the approved construction drawings.
The official responsible for the inspection of all street improvements
including storm sewers, sanitary sewers, water lines, final grading, etc. shall
be the Village Engineer.
All inspection fees shall be paid by the subdivider at the rates as spelled out
in the Engineer's contract with the Village.
The subdivider shall notify the Village Engineer three days prior to start of
construction. Failure of proper notification shall result in nonacceptance of
work completed without inspection. If for any reason the subdivider halts work,
the Engineer is to be notified in advance. Failure to notify the Engineer will
result in charges of a minimum of three hours inspection time.
   (b)    Alignment.
      (1)    Minimum horizontal-radii of centerline curvature.
 
Major streets                3° 1900 ft.
Collector streets            12°475 ft.
Minor streets                28°200 ft.
Streets shorter than 500 ft. 58°100 ft.
A minimum 100 foot tangent shall be introduced between reversed curves.
      (2)    Visibility requirements.
         A.    Minimum vertical visibility (measured 3.75 ft. eye level to 6
inches above ground level.)
            600 ft. on major streets
            350 ft. on collector streets
            250 ft. on minor streets
            200 ft. on streets shorter than 500 ft.
         B.    Minimum horizontal visibility.
            600 ft. on major streets, measured on centerline.
            350 ft. on collector streets, measured on centerline.
            200 ft. on all other streets, measured on centerline.
   (c)   Street and Alley Width. The width of all major thoroughfares shall
conform to the width designated by the Village and Trumbull County, Ohio.
   The minimum right-of-way widths for streets and alleys are as follows:
 
Type of Street or Way                       Minimum Right-of-Way Width
                                            or Variable Right-of-Way Width
Arterial highway or major thoroughfare (See Variable*
Major Thoroughfare Plan)
Secondary or collector streets              60-70 ft.
Minor or local urban streets                50-60 ft.
Rural roads or streets serving low density  50 ft.
suburban developments
Alleys                                      30 ft.
Cul-de-sacs                                 50 ft.
 
   *As specified by major thoroughfare plan or as determined by the Planning
Commission.
   (d)    Cul-de-sacs. Each cul-de-sac shall be provided with a turnaround
having a minimum right-of-way radius of sixty feet and a maximum length of 530
feet measured from the intersection of the centerlines of the entering
intersection and including the turnaround. The outside of the pavement within
the turnaround right-of-way shall have a minimum radius of fifty feet.
   (e)    Dead-end Streets. Streets designated to be dead-ended permanently
shall not be permitted. Any dead-end street of temporary nature, if longer than
200 feet or fronted by existing lots, shall have a surfaced turning area equal
in diameter to the right-of-way width required for a cul-de-sac. There shall be
provision made for the future extension of the street and utilities and shall
be a reversionary right to the land owners abutting the temporary turnaround
for the excess right-of-way.
   (f)   Half-streets. Dedication of half-streets shall be discouraged. Where
there exists a dedicated or platted half-street adjacent to the tract being
subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission.
   (g)    Alleys. Alleys shall be avoided in single or two-family districts.
They may, however, be required in multiple dwelling developments. Alleys are
required in the rear of all commercial and industrial lots if no other
provisions are made for adequate service access or for access to parking. The
rights-of-way of such alleys shall not be less than thirty feet, and dead-end
alleys shall not be permitted.
   (h)    Location. When a proposed subdivision is adjacent to or contains a
state highway, the developer and Planning Commission should seek information
from the Ohio Department of Highways as to the status of the highway in
reference to width and direction, and also the type of access permitted to such
highway.
   (i)    Limitation of Number of Vehicular Access Points to Arterial Highways
or Major Streets. Safety factors and the need for effective utilization of
major thoroughfares require the limiting of the number of vehicular access
points to arterial highways and major streets to promote efficient traffic
movements and reduce safety hazards. Where a subdivision adjoins an arterial
highway or major street, vehicular access to subdivided lots shall be kept to a
minimum and shall not exceed the following standards:
 
Feet of Subdivision Maximum Number of Vehicular
Frontage            Access Points
Less than 500 ft.   One
500 - 1,000 ft.     Two
                    Two for the first 1,000 ft. of
Over 1,000 ft.      frontage, plus one point of
                    access for each additional 1,000
                    feet of frontage.
   The local street arrangements connecting with these access points may be
accomplished in one of three ways.
      (1)    Marginal access street - with a planting strip of a minimum width
of twenty feet between the major street or highway pavement and the marginal
access street pavement. The marginal access street shall have a minimum
pavement width of twenty feet.
      (2)    Local street (reverse frontage) - with residences facing away from
the major thoroughfare. In this case, the rear yards (those between the
residences and the major thoroughfare) shall have a minimum depth of seventy
feet which includes a twenty foot reservation strip abutting the major
thoroughfare for screen planting of trees and shrubs. A masonry or wooden
ornamental screen may be substituted for the planting.
      (3)    Intersecting local streets or cul-de-sac streets - perpendicular
to the major thoroughfare where unusual topographic conditions warrant such
design.
   (j)    Street Grades (Vertical Curves). No street grade shall be less than
one-half percent (. 5%) and shall not exceed the following width with due
allowance for reasonable vertical curves:
 
      Main or arterial thoroughfares    4%
      Secondary thoroughfares       6%
      Minor streets             6%
      Cul-de-sacs             8%
   (k)    Street Grades (Cross-Section). For cross-section of streets see
approved standard drawings.
   (l)    Street Names. Street names shall be selected which will not duplicate
or be confused with the names of existing streets in Trumbull County or the
Village irrespective of modifying terms such as street, avenue, boulevard, etc.
Street names shall be subject to approval of the Planning Commission and
wherever possible shall be in accordance with the following system:
 
General Direction Over 1,000 Ft. Under 1,000 Ft.
North-South       Avenue         Place
East-West         Street         Court
Diagonal          Road           Way
Curving           Drive          Lane or Circle
 
   (m)    Street Signs. Street signs shall be required and paid for by the
developer at all intersections and shall be erected in accordance with the
specifications of the Village Street Commissioner. All such signs shall also be
subject to the approval of the Planning Commission as to uniform design and
legibility.
   (n)    Acceptance of Streets. The Village Engineer shall, upon written
request and at the expense of the owner of the land upon which the street has
been constructed, check the construction by stages; and if the Village Engineer
finds that such street is constructed in accordance with the specifications set
forth on the approved plat and that such street is in good repair, then such
finding, endorsed on the approved plat, shall recommend that Council accept the
street for public use by the Village.
(Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1161.04  BLOCKS AND LOTS.
   (a)    Block Design. No block shall be longer than 1,200 feet nor less than
500 feet, except in unusual circumstances. Where a subdivision adjoins a major
highway, the greater dimension of the block shall front along such major
highway to minimize the number of points of ingress or egress.
   Where blocks are over 750 feet in length, a walkway easement not less than
10 feet in width may be required if necessary to provide proper access through
the block.
   Blocks for multi-family, business or industrial subdivisions shall be
designed to accommodate the building sites and provide the yards, internal
service drives, required off-street parking and other such required facilities
for unit development rather than typical lot and street pattern.
   (b)    Lots. The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to
topography and the character of surrounding development.
   All side lines of lots shall be at approximate right angles to straight
lines and radial to curved street lines except where a variation to this rule
will provide better street and lot layout. Lots with double frontage shall be
avoided.
   No lot shall have less area or width than is required by the zoning
regulations applying to the area in which it is located.
   In case of unusual soil conditions which may impair the health and safety of
the neighborhood in which a subdivision may be located, upon recommendation of
the Village Engineer, the Commission may require larger lot widths and lot
areas than might otherwise be necessary.
   No corner lot shall have a width at the building line of less than eighty-
five feet. Either of the two sides of a corner lot fronting on a street may be
designated the front of a lot provided the rear yard shall always be opposite
the frontage so designated.
   All corner lots, be they at the intersection of the rights-of-way of two
streets, shall have a curve with a minimum radius of twenty-five feet joining
the two sidelines of such rights-of-way.
   (c)   “Through lots” as defined by Section
1151.07(38.1) shall be prohibited within residential districts within the
Village.
(Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1161.05 BUILDING LINES AND EASEMENTS.
   (a)   Building Lines. Building lines shall be established according to the
front yard requirements set forth in the Village Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Easements. Easements of at least seven and one-half feet in width
shall be provided on each side of all rear lot lines and along side lot lines,
where necessary, for underground utilities such as electric, telephone service
and gas mains. Easements having greater width dimensions may also be required
along or across lots where engineering design or special conditions may
necessitate the installation of water and sewer lines outside public rights-of-
way. For lots facing on curvilinear streets, the rear easement should consist
of straight lines with a minimum number of points of deflection.
   (c)   Easement Along Streams. Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located in the area being subdivided, the subdivider shall
provide an easement of at least forty feet in width, or such width as may be
determined by the Planning Commission and Village Engineer along each side of
the stream for the purpose of widening, deepening, relocation or protecting the
stream drainage or public use.
(Ord. 2477-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1161.06 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   When the subdivision contains a park, school, or other public area, such
area shall either be dedicated to the proper agency or it shall be reserved for
acquisition thereby within 120 days by a purchase or other means, and an
agreement shall be entered into between the subdivider and the proper public
agency regarding the time and method of the acquisition and the cost thereof.
(Ord. 2477-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1161.07 LAND SUBJECT TO FLOOD; POOR DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   The right is reserved to disapprove any subdivision which is subject to
periodic flooding or which contains extremely poor drainage facilities.
However, if the subdivider agrees to make such improvements as will make the
area completely safe for residential occupancy, the subdivision may be
approved, subject, however, to the approval of the County Board of Health and
the Village Engineer.
(Ord. 2477-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1161.08 COMPATIBILITY OF ADJACENT LAND USES.
   It shall be at the discretion of the Planning Commission to permit
noncompatible land uses to develop on adjacent properties. Where such a
condition arises, screening by fences or landscaping shall be required to
protect the land uses from infringement, one upon the other. Screening shall be
established according to zoned land uses adjacent one to another and shall be
as set forth in the Village Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)

1163.01 FINAL INSPECTION; TESTING.
   (a)    The subdivider upon completion of all improvements shall request in
writing a final inspection by the Village Engineer. The Village Engineer shall
make final inspection of streets, storm sewers, any flood control improvements,
sanitary sewers and water lines.
   (b)    Whenever deemed necessary by the Village Engineer, the developer
shall provide evidence from independent testing laboratory as to the
satisfactory condition of any or all items which are incorporated in the
improvement. The testing procedures to provide such evidence will be the
current methods being used or recommended by the Ohio Department of
Transportation and/or the State of Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   (c)    Prior to final acceptance, the developer may, at the discretion of
the Engineer, be required to show evidence of satisfactory pavement thickness

(Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1163.02 UTILITIES AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS.
   Electrical service, gas mains and other utilities shall be provided

right-of-way must meet the approval of the Park and Recreation Committee with
regard to location and types of trees.
(Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1163.03 IMPROVEMENTS BOND.
   (a)    Type of Guarantees and Terms. The improvements and standards
described in this section have been adopted by Council on the effective date of
these Regulations, and no final or official plat of any subdivision shall be
approved unless Council is satisfied that:
   The subdivider shall have filed with Council a surety bond, cashier's check
or certified check for one hundred percent (100%) of the installation cost of
the improvements, which shall be approved by the Planning Commission,
guaranteeing to the Village that such improvements will be constructed and
completed in a satisfactory manner and within a period specified by the Village
Engineer, but such period shall not exceed two years unless mutually extended.
The bond or checks shall be approved by the Solicitor and shall be made payable
to, and enforced by the Village and shall provide that the subdivider, his
heirs, successors, and assigns, their agent or servants will comply with all
applicable terms, conditions, provisions and requirements of these Regulations.
Upon satisfactory completion of the improvements and approval of the same, in
writing, by the Village Engineer, and with the presentation of letters of
certification of payment in full of all contractors, subcontractors, suppliers
of materials, engineers, surveyors and all inspection fees or other fees
incurred by the installation of the improvements by the subdivider, the bonds
may be released, in writing, by the Clerk, or the cashier's or certified check
may be returned to the developer.
   (b)    Portion of Improvements. When a portion of the improvements has, upon
inspection by the Village Engineer, been satisfactorily completed, a reduction
in the bonds or partial withdrawal of funds may be authorized, provided,
however, that such reduction shall not reduce the balance of the bond below the
reestimated completion cost as of the date of reduction, provided further, that
all other requirements of this section have been properly executed.
   (c)    Progressive Installation. The developer may apply for final approval
and recording of only a portion of the entire subdivision. Under such a
progressive unit development procedure, the installation of required
improvements and sale or lease of lots may proceed only on that portion of the
subdivision which has been approved and recorded.
   (d)    Failure to Complete Site Improvements. In the event the developer
fails to complete the installation of all improvements according to the terms
and conditions of the Agreement, the Village upon proper notice, may complete
same and appropriate such portion of money or bonds posted for the faithful
performance of such work.
(Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1163.04 PROVISIONS FOR MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION.
   Where the subdivision contains sewers, sewage treatment plants, water supply
systems, park areas, street trees or other physical facilities, necessary or
desirable for the welfare of the area and which are of common use or benefit
and which are of such character that the Village, county or other public agency
does not desire to maintain them, then provisions shall be made by trust
agreements, which are a part of the deed restrictions and which are acceptable
to the Commission for the proper and continuous maintenance and of such
facilities by the lot owners in the subdivision.
(Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1163.05 RECORDING OF PLAT.
   No plat of any subdivision shall be entitled to be recorded in the office of
the County Recorder or have any validity until it shall have been approved in
the manner prescribed herein. In the event any such unapproved plat is recorded
it shall be considered invalid, and the Planning Commission shall institute
proceedings to have the plat stricken from the records of Trumbull County,
State of Ohio. (Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1163.06 SALE OF LAND IN SUBDIVISION.
   No owner or agent of the owner of any land located within a subdivision
shall transfer or sell any land by reference to, exhibition of, or by use of a
plan or plat of a subdivision before such plan or plat has been approved and
recorded in the manner prescribed herein. Any sale or transfer contrary to the
provisions of this section is void. The description of such lot or parcel by
metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other documents used in the
process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction from the
provisions of these Regulations.
(Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)

   (a)    Building or repair permits shall not be issued for any structure on a
lot in a subdivision for which a plat has not been approved and recorded in the
manner prescribed herein.
   (b)    No owner or agent of the owner of any land shall be entitled to a
permit for the installation of wells and septic tanks upon any lots in a

prescribed herein.
(Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1163.08 PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.
   The Village defines its policy to be that it will withhold all public
improvements of whatsoever nature, including the maintenance of streets and the
furnishing of sewage facilities and water service from all subdivisions which
have not been approved, and from all areas dedicated to the public which have
not been accepted by Council in the manner prescribed herein.
(Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1163.09 TEMPORARY MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE.
   The subdivider shall maintain all improvements for one year after completion
as determined by the inspection of the County Engineer. Maintenance shall be
guaranteed by the posting of a maintenance bond in favor of the Planning
Commission or some other suitable instrument as approved by the Commission
covering ten percent (10%) of the total estimated cost of all improvements as
shown on the approved construction drawings. The minimum amount of bond shall
be not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000).

1165.01 VARIANCES.
   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape, or is
surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements of these Regulations would result in real
difficulties, substantial hardship, or injustice, such requirements may be
varied or modified so that the subdivider may subdivide his property in a
reasonable manner, but at the same time, the public welfare and interest of the
Village and the surrounding area are thoroughly protected and the general
intent and spirit of these Regulations are enforced. The Planning Commission
may make recommendations of variations which may be permitted, but the
authority for approval of such variations shall rest with Council.
   All land uses shall be incorporated in the plat and must conform, in
general, to the areas of land usage as delineated and adopted by the Planning
Commission and Council. All plats shall insure that adequate public spaces,
circulation, recreation light and air will be provided and the needs of the
entire community when fully developed and occupied will be fully met.
   Where topography and other physical conditions make full compliance with
Chapter
1161 an undue hardship upon the owner, the Planning Commission may refer the
problem of compliance to the Village Engineer and Council for recommendations
as to possible variances.
(Ord. 2744-97. Passed 7-16-97.)
1165.02 FEE.
   (a)   Property owners shall pay a fee with their application for a variance
of the terms and requirements of the McDonald Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   The fees shall be paid into the General Fund of the Village.

1335.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of McDonald, State of Ohio, does ordain as
follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of McDonald has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)    Protect human life and health;
      (2)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)    Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
McDonald as identified in Section 
1335.01 (f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
McDonald.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Trumbull County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Trumbull County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective June 18, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)    Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of McDonald as required by Section
1335.04 (c) Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at 451 Ohio Avenue, McDonald, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or
Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over these
regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of McDonald, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 3076-
10. Passed 5-5-10.)

   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway. A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by McDonald’s historic preservation program, which program is certified by the
Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
   (v)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
   (w)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   (x)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (y)   Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (z)   Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (aa)   Manufactured home park. As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27- 01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (bb)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (cc)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of McDonald
Flood Insurance Rate Map, August 8, 1979, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (dd)   Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (ee)   Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (ff)   Registered Professional Architect. A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (gg)   Registered Professional Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (hh)   Registered Professional Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ii)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (jj)   Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (kk)   Structure. A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ll)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (mm)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (nn)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (oo)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 3076-10. Passed 5-5-10.)

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that McDonald’s flood maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1335.01 (f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1335.04 (c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section 
1335.03 (j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1335.03 (j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of McDonald,
and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of McDonald have been modified by annexation or the community has
assumed authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of McDonald’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village
of McDonald boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
Village of McDonald suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the Village of McDonald has assumed
or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section 
1335.05 , Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)    Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims. (Ord. 3076-10. Passed 5-5-10.)
1335.04 USE AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.

   (h)   Above Ground Gas or Liquid Storage Tanks. All above ground gas or
liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or lateral movement
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)   Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1335.03 (j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of Village of McDonald and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
 1335.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3.-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
McDonald specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1335.03 (j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
            (Ord. 3076-10. Passed 5-5-10.)
1335.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby appointed to serve as the
Appeals Board for these regulations as established by the McDonald Code Chapter
1335.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in 451 Ohio
Avenue, McDonald, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1335.05 (d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within twenty [20] days of the date of such notice and
order, or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such
hearing or for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the
Floodplain Administrator’s decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by
the applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of
the appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made
to the Appeals Board. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties
in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the Schedule of Fees adopted by Trumbull
County.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (5)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1335.05 (d)(3)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Trumbull Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 3076-10. Passed 5-5-
10.)
1335.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.

1340.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the Exterior Property Maintenance Code of the
Village. (Ord. 2696-95. Passed 1-4-95.)
1340.02  SCOPE.
   This chapter is strictly limited to the establishment of minimum standards
for the maintenance of exterior surfaces and exterior functioning units of all
structures and buildings within the Village, including yard areas immediately
contiguous thereto. No provisions of this chapter shall, in any way, directly
or indirectly, be interpreted to interfere with, or to limit the right of, any
owner or resident to inhabit real property owned or leased by them in such
manner and form as they may determine appropriate, consonant with other
applicable provisions of law. This chapter is directed to obvious visual
problems which may occasion incipient, blighting conditions within the Village.
All matters of the interior use, occupancy or habitation of any structure or
building within the Village are specifically excluded from the provisions of
this chapter.
(Ord. 2696-95. Passed 1-4-95.)
1340.03 PURPOSES.
   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and
welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance,
appearance, and exterior condition of all premises throughout the Village; to
fix certain responsibilities and duties upon owners, residents and managers of
the same as to both separate and correlative responsibilities and duties; to
authorize and establish procedures for the exterior inspection of such
premises; to fix penalties for the violations of this chapter; and to provide
for the repair, demolition or vacation of premises unfit for human habitation,
occupancy or use. This chapter is hereby declared to be remedial and essential
for the public interest, and it is intended that this chapter be construed and
interpreted to effectuate the purposes as stated herein. (Ord. 2696-95. Passed
1-4-95.)
1340.04 FINDINGS; DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   It is hereby found and declared that there exists in the Village various and
several structures, including yard areas immediately contiguous thereto, which
are, or may become in the future, deteriorated or defective with respect to
exterior maintenance, or further, that such condition, including but not
limited to, structural deterioration, lack of maintenance and appearance of
exterior of premises, existence of exterior fire hazards and unsanitary
conditions, constitute an immediate threat to the health, safety, welfare and
reasonable comfort of the residents and inhabitants of the Village. It is
further found and declared that, by reason of lack of maintenance and
progressive deterioration, the exterior of appearance of certain properties
have the further effect of creating blighting conditions and initiating
depressed neighborhood groupings, and that if the same are not curtailed and
corrected, the conditions are likely to grow and spread and necessitate, in
time, the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate
the same, and that by reason of timely regulations and restrictions as herein
contained, the growth of such blight may be prevented and the immediate
neighborhood and property values thereby maintained.
(Ord. 2696-95. Passed 1-4-95.)
1340.05  APPLICABILITY.
   Every residential, nonresidential or mixed occupancy building and the land
on which it is situated, used or intended to be used for dwelling, commercial
business or industrial occupancy shall comply with the provisions of this
chapter whether or not such building shall have been constructed, altered or
repaired before or after the enactment of this chapter, and. without regard to
any permits or licenses which shall have been issued for the use or occupancy
of the building or premises for the construction or repair of the building, or
for the installation or repair of equipment or facilities prior to the
effective date of this chapter. This chapter establishes minimum standards for
the initial and continued occupancy and use of all such structures and does not
replace or modify standards otherwise established for the construction, repair,
alteration or use of the building. Where there is a mixed occupancy,
residential or nonresidential use therein shall be nevertheless regulated by
and subject to the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 2696-95. Passed 1-4-95.)
1340.06 CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   In any case where a provision. of this chapter imposes a higher standard
than that set forth in any other chapter by the Village or law of the State,
then the standard set forth herein, shall prevail, but if a provision of this
chapter imposes a lower standard than that imposed by any other ordinance of
the Village or law of the State, then the higher standard contained in any such
other ordinance or law shall prevail.
(Ord. 2696-95. Passed 1-4-95.)
1340.07 ENFORCEMENT.
   The enforcement of any and all provisions of this chapter is placed with the
Office of the Zoning Inspector, and such Zoning Inspector, together with such
additional enforcement officers as may be required, shall carry out and
effectuate all of the provisions herein.
   (a)    Inspection. All buildings and premises within the Village are subject
to exterior inspections by the Office of the Zoning Inspector, providing there
is reasonable cause that a violation may exist.
   (b)    Notice and Appeal.
      (1)    Where a violation of any provision of this chapter is found to
exist, the Zoning Inspector shall cause a written notice of such violation to
be served upon the person responsible for the correction thereof. The notice
shall specify the violation committed and shall provide for a reasonable period
of time, not more than sixty days, to correct or abate the violation. In the
event that weather is a major consideration in correcting or abating a
violation, the Zoning Administrator may extend the time set out herein to not
more than sixty days immediately following the occurrence of appropriate
weather conditions.
      (2)    Notice may be served personally or by certified mail addressed to
the last known address of the person to be served or by leaving a copy thereof
at the usual residence of the person to be served. If the last known address
cannot be ascertained, the notice shall be posted on the outside front entrance
of the structure in alleged violation.
      (3)    In the absence of any appeal, as provided below, the completion of
notice, and failure to comply, shall constitute a final order as to these
administrative proceedings.
   (c)    Appeal.
      (1)    Within ten days of the date of service of notice, any person
affected by the notice may request a hearing thereon before the Board of Zoning
Appeals by filing a written request with the Chairman of the Board. The
Chairman of the Board, upon receipt of the request, shall within thirty days
therefrom, and upon five days notice to the party and the Zoning Inspector, set
the matter down for hearing. The Board may sustain, modify or dismiss, in whole
or in part, any action required to correct or abate the violation set forth in
the notice and shall issue an order incorporating its determinations, and such
order shall be a final order as to these administrative proceedings, provided,
however, that any order of modification or dismissal shall be effective for two
years following the date of issuance of such order, and thereafter, the subject
matter of such order of modification or dismissal may be amenable to further
inspection, notice and appeal as set forth herein.
      (2)    The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider only the following in
determining appropriate action to be taken, to wit:
         A.    That any modification of the original order of the Zoning
Inspector shall not, in any material way, alter the standards of this chapter,
and shall not affect detrimentally the health or safety of occupants, or the
health, safety or welfare of the occupants or owners of adjacent premises or of
the immediate neighborhood; and
         B.    That strict enforcement would constitute an undue and
unnecessary hardship on the owner, manager or resident, by reason of compelling
an expenditure for repair of the premises which would be substantially
disproportionate to any benefit to health, safety or welfare of the community
that might be derived therefrom.
   No license or permit or other certification of compliance with this chapter
shall constitute a defense against any violation of any other local ordinance
applicable to any structure or premises, nor shall any provision herein relieve
any owner, manager or resident from complying with any such other provision,
nor any official of the Village from enforcing any such other provision. (Ord.
2696-95. Passed 1-4-95.)

1343.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this regulation is to establish technically feasible
and economically reasonable storm water management standards to achieve a level
of storm water quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to
property and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the
health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Village of McDonald:
   (b)   This regulation requires owners who develop or re-develop their
property within the Village of McDonald to:
      (1)   Control storm water runoff from their property and ensure that all
storm water management practices are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of storm water runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Preserve natural infiltration and ground water recharge, and
maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water resources, except in slippage
prone soils.
      (6)   Incorporate storm water quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (7)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate storm water management.
      (8)   Maximize use of storm water management practices that serve
multiple purposes including, but not limited to, flood control, erosion
control, fire protection, water quality protection, recreation, and habitat
preservation.
      (9)   Design sites to minimize the number of stream crossings and the
width of associated disturbance in order to minimize the Village of McDonald
future expenses related to the maintenance and repair of stream crossings.
      (10)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   (c)   This regulation shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
1343
.

Village of McDonald shall comply with this regulation for roadway projects
initiated after March 10, 2006 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for
projects initiated before that time.
   (e)   This regulation does not apply to activities regulated by, and in
compliance with, the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution Abatement Rules.
   (f)   This regulation does not require a Comprehensive Storm Water
Management Plan for linear construction projects, such as pipeline or utility
line installation, that do not result in the installation of impervious surface
as determined by the Village Administrator. Such projects must be designed to
minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of disturbance. Linear
construction projects must comply with the requirements Ohio E.P.A. and United
States E.P.A. rules and regulations. (Ord. 3069-10. Passed 2-17-10.)

EPA is necessary. To demonstrate the equivalency, the applicant must show:
         A.   The alternative BMP has a minimum total suspended solid (TSS)
removal efficiency of 80 percent, using the Level II Technology Acceptance
Reciprocity Partnership (TARP) testing protocol.
         B.   The water quality volume discharge rate from the selected BMP is
reduced to prevent stream bed erosion, unless there will be negligible
hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the State. The discharge
rate from the BMP will have negligible impacts if the applicant can demonstrate
one of the following conditions:
            1.   The entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater.
            2.   The development will create less than one acre of impervious
surface.
            3.   The development project is a redevelopment project with an
ultra-urban setting, such as a downtown area, or on a site where 100 percent of
the project area is already impervious surface and the storm water discharge is
directed into an existing storm sewer system.
   The storm water drainage system of the development discharges directly into
a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake, and where the
development area is less than 5 percent of the water area upstream of the
development site, unless a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) has identified water
quality problems in the receiving surface water of the State.
   (d)   Storm Water Quantity Control: The Comprehensive Storm Water Management
Plan shall describe how the proposed storm water management practices are
designed to meet the post- construction storm water quantity control method
requirement as set forth in the most recent edition of the Trumbull County

chapter. (Ord. 3070-10. Passed 2-17-10.)
1345.06 ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY.
   The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to this chapter are

(Ord. 3070-10. Passed 2-17-10.)
1345.07 DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illegal Discharges. No person shall discharge or cause
to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any
materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than storm water. The commencement, conduct or continuance of
any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as
described as follows:
      (1)    The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this ordinance: water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped
ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater
dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs,
non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wet-land flows,
swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than one PPM chlorine), fire
fighting activities, and any other water source not containing Pollutants.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement
agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the
test.
      (4)   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   (b)   Prohibition of Illicit Connections.
      (1)   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
      (2)   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (3)    A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue. (Ord. 3070-10. Passed 2-17-10.)
1345.08 SUSPENSION OF MS4 ACCESS.
   (a)   Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The
Village Administrator may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access
to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps
as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (b)   Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized
enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
   (c)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this Section, without the prior approval of the
authorized enforcement agency. (Ord. 3070-10. Passed 2-17-10.)
1345.09 INDUSTRIAL OR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY DISCHARGES.
   Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm
water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof
of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the
Village Administrator prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. (Ord.
3070-10. Passed 2-17-10.)
1345.10 MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.
   (a)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have storm
water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
   (b)   Access to Facilities.
      (1)   The Village Administrator shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this ordinance as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the Village Administrator ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an
NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional
duties as defined by state and federal law.
      (3)   The Village Administrator shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's storm water discharge.
      (4)   The Village Administrator has the right to require the discharger
to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Village Administrator and shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Village Administrator access to
a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of
this ordinance. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit
to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense
if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this ordinance.
      (7)   If the Village Administrator has been refused access to any part of
the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
ordinance or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement
agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction. (Ord. 3070-10. Passed 2-17-10.)
1345.11 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The Village Administrator will adopt requirements identifying Best
Management Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause
or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain
system, or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial
or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these
structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance
with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater
pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 3070-10. Passed 2-17-10.)
1345.12 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.
   Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical
integrity of the watercourse. (Ord. 3070-10. Passed 2-17-10.)
1345.13 NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS.
   Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible
for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a
facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of
materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants
discharging into storm water, the storm drain system, or water of the United
States said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery,
containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of
hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response
agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a
release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the authorized
enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written
notice addressed and mailed to the Village Administrator within three (3)
business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three (3) years. (Ord. 3070-10. Passed 2-17-10.)
1345.14 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Village Administrator finds that a
person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this
ordinance, the authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written
notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require without
limitation:

and
      (6)   The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
   (b)   If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation
or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the
expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
(Ord. 3070-10. Passed 2-17-10.)
1345.15 APPEAL OF NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation may appeal the determination of
the authorized enforcement agency. The notice of appeal must be received within

person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the government agency
or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth
above. (Ord. 3070-10. Passed 2-17-10.)
1345.17 COST OF ABATEMENT OF THE VIOLATION.
   Within thirty (30) days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the
property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative
costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of
the assessment within ten (10) days. If the amount due is not paid within a
timely manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by
the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become
a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the
property for the amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the
provisions of this article shall become liable to the city by reason of such
violation. The liability shall be paid in not more than twelve (12) equal
payments. Interest at the rate of ten percent per annum shall be assessed on
the balance beginning on the first day following discovery of the violation.
(Ord. 3070-10. Passed 2-17-10.)
1345.18 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to
comply with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated

personally, or if a copy is sent by registered mail to his last known address,
or if a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or about the dwelling affected
by the notice, or if he is served with such notice by any other method
authorized or required under the laws of the State. Such notice may contain an
outline of remedial action which, if taken, will effect compliance with the
provisions of this chapter and with rules and regulations adopted pursuant
thereto.
   (b)    Any person affected by any notice which has been issued in connection
with the enforcement of any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation
adopted pursuant hereto may request and shall be granted a hearing on the

served. Upon receipt of such petition the Mayor shall set a time and place for
such hearing and shall give the petitioner written notice thereof. At such
hearing the petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be heard and to show
why such notice should be modified or withdrawn. The hearing shall be commenced

chapter or by any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, when such notice
has been sustained by the Mayor, the permit shall be deemed to have been
revoked. Any permit which has been suspended by a notice shall be deemed to be

shall be effective immediately. Any person to whom such order is directed shall
comply therewith immediately, but upon petition to the Mayor shall be afforded
a hearing as soon as possible. After such hearing, depending upon his findings
as to whether the provisions of this chapter and of the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant thereto have been complied with, the Mayor shall continue such
order in effect, modify it, or revoke it.

Board of Health and shall further recite the order of the Mayor directing the
demolition of the structure.
   (g)   The Mayor or his designee may provide for the abatement, control or
removal of vegetation, garbage, refuse, and other debris from land in the
Village, if the Mayor or his designee determines that the owner’s maintenance
of such vegetation, garbage, refuse and other debris constitutes a nuisance.
   (h)   At least seven days before providing for the abatement, control, or
removal of any vegetation, garbage, refuse or debris, the Mayor or his designee
shall notify the owner of the land and any holders of liens of record upon the
land that:
      (1)   The owner is ordered to abate, control or remove the vegetation,
garbage, refuse or other debris, the owner’s maintenance of which has been
determined by the Mayor or his designee to be a nuisance;
      (2)   If such vegetation, garbage, refuse or debris is not abated,
controlled, or removed, or if provision for its abatement, control or removal
is not made, within seven days, the Mayor or his designee shall provide for the
abatement, control or removal, and any expenses incurred by the Mayor or his
designee in performing that task shall be entered upon the tax duplicate and
become a lien upon the land from the date of entry.
The Mayor or his designee shall send the notice to the owner of the land by
certified mail if the owner is a resident of the Village or is a nonresident
whose address is known, and by certified mail to lien holders of record;
alternatively, if the owner is a resident of the Village or is a nonresident
whose address is known, the Mayor or his designee may give notice to the owner
by causing any of their agents or employees to post the notice on the principal
structure on the land and to photograph that posted notice with a camera
capable of recording the date of the photograph on it. If the owner’s address
is unknown and cannot reasonably be obtained, it is sufficient to publish the
notice once in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village. The owner of
the land or holders of liens of record upon the land may enter into an
agreement with the Mayor or his designee providing for either party to the
agreement to perform the abatement, control or removal before the time the
Mayor or his designee is required to provide for the abatement, control or
removal under subsection (i) hereof.
   (i)   If, within seven days after notice is given, the owner of the land
fails to abate, control or remove the vegetation, garbage, refuse, or debris,
or no agreement for its abatement, control or removal is entered into under
subsection (h) hereof, the Mayor or his designee shall provide for the
abatement, control or removal and may employ the necessary labor, materials,
and equipment to perform the task. All expenses incurred shall, when approved
by the Mayor or his designee, be paid out of the Village’s general fund from
monies not otherwise appropriated.
   (j)   The Mayor or his designee shall make a written report to the county
auditor of the Mayor or his designee’s action under this section. The Mayor or
his designee shall include in the report a statement of all expenses incurred
in providing for the abatement, control or removal of any vegetation, garbage,
refuse, or debris, as provided in subsection (i) hereof, including the Mayor or
his designee’s charges for its services, notification, the amount paid for the
labor, materials and equipment, and a proper description of the premises. The
expenses incurred, when allowed, shall be entered upon the tax duplicate, and
are a lien upon the land from the date of the entry, and shall be collected as
other taxes and returned to the Village and placed in the Village’s general
fund.
