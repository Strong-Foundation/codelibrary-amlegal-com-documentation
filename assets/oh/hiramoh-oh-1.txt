and
WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane

component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Hiram, Ohio.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Fiscal Officer, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Hiram, Ohio.
SECTION 2: The provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of the
Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in Section

Ordinance except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:

adopted hereby.

necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the Village, the reason for the necessity being
that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
Village, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation and avoid
practical and legal entanglements.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or

re-enactments or amendments thereof. (ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and

designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

superseded by the Codified Ordinances.

101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern. (ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail. (ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective. (ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a

103.02   Record requests.
103.03   Costs for public records.
103.04   E-mail.
103.05   Records retention manual.
 
 
103.01 PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   The Village of Hiram, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code,
defines records as including the following: Any document - paper, electronic
(including, but not limited to, e- mail), or other format - that is created or
received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents
the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations or
other activities of the office. All records of the Village are public unless
they are specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code.
   (b)   It is the policy of the Village that, as required by Ohio law, records
will be organized and maintained so that they are readily available for
inspection and copying. Record retention schedules are to be updated as needed
and posted prominently.
(Ord. 2007-35. Passed 12-11-07.)
103.02 RECORD REQUESTS.
   Each request for public records should be evaluated for a response using the
following guidelines:
   (a)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requestor in revising
the request by informing the requestor of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing, and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record.
   (c)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, which are Monday thru Friday 9:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. with the
exception of published holidays. Public records are to be made available for
inspection as promptly as possible. Copies of public records must be made
available within a reasonable period of time. “Prompt” and “reasonable” take
into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the location
where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review of the
records requested.
   (d)   (1)   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
requested to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms, and applications, personnel rosters, etc.
      (2)   All requests for public records must either be satisfied (see
subsection (d)(1)) or be acknowledged in writing by the Village within three
business days following the office’s receipt of the request. If a request is
deemed significant beyond “routine”, such as seeking a voluminous number of
copies or requiring extensive research, the acknowledgment should include the
following:
         A.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
         B.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
         C.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
         D.   The actual cost of mailing and/or postage, if mailing if
requested.
   (e)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority.
      (Ord. 2007-35. Passed 12-11-07.)
103.03 COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual cost of
making copies.
      (1)   The charge for paper copies is 5 cents per page.
      (2)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a computer disc is
$1.00 per disc. If supplied by the requestor, a factory sealed disc may be
substituted.
      (3)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
      (4)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. In addition to
the charge for copying, mail requests will be charged the actual cost of the
postage and mailing supplies.
      (5)   Payment must be made by check, money order, or bank draft. No cash
will be accepted. (Ord. 2007-35. Passed 12-11-07.)
103.04 E-MAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office. E-mail
is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats.
   (a)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business are
subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this office are
instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business (see Section 
103.01  Public Records) and to copy them to their business e-mail accounts and/
or to the office’s records custodian.
   (b)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts as
records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules and making them available for inspection and
copying in accordance with the Public Records Act.
      (Ord. 2007-35. Passed 12-11-07.)
103.05 RECORDS RETENTION MANUAL.
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Pursuant to Ordinance 2007-37, passed February 14, 2008, the

of the credit card for work-related purchase. A detailed receipt must be
provided by the purchaser to the Fiscal Officer. This receipt will be matched

the employee being responsible for the incurred charges.
      (5)   It is the responsibility of the employee making the purchase to
insure the completeness, accuracy and legibility of the entries on the receipt.
      (6)   A completed Use of Credit Card Form with the following information

apportionment percentage to be determined by:

a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the return
shall be filed on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month
following the end of such fiscal year of period. The Administrator is hereby
authorized to provide by regulation that the return
of an employer or employers, showing the amount of tax deducted by said
employer or employers from the salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation of an employee, and paid by him or them to the Administrator may
be accepted as the return required of any employee whose sole income, subject

and regardless of the amount taxable income, if any, shall file a return on or
before April 15 of the following year.
      (3)   All returns shall be signed under oath and with an assertion that
the statements and representations contained therein are true under the penalty
of perjury.
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Administrator on a form or forms

generic form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of
the information required to be submitted with the Village's prescribed return,
setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions and other
compensation received, allocated, apportioned or set aside, other income
defined by statute as taxable and gross income from business, profession or
other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such

Revenue Service form 2106 or 2106EZ) which the employee deducted as an itemized
deduction from the employee's Adjusted Gross Income on his or her federal tax
return, but only to the extent that such expenses were directly incurred in
earning the income subject to the tax imposed by this chapter. The employee
shall furnish a copy of the form 2106 or 2106EZ, Schedule A and Form 1040 as
filed with the IRS. Further, the 2106 or 2106EZ expenses shall be allocated

Revenue Service for the filing of the Federal Income Tax Return. A copy of the
Federal extension form shall be filed with the Administrator on or before the
original due date of the return. The Administrator may require a tentative
return, accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon by
the date the return is normally due. No penalty shall be assessed in those
cases in which the return is filed and the final tax paid within the period as
extended; however, the amount by which the actual tax found to be due exceeds
the payment submitted with the extension or paid declaration shall bear
interest from the original due date of the return, pursuant to the provisions
of Section
181.12.
      (1)   An extension may be denied by the Administrator if the taxpayer
fails to timely file the request, fails to file a copy of the request for the
federal extension, owes on any delinquent income tax or any penalty, interest,
assessment, or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax,
or has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or other related
document for any prior tax period. ORC (Section 718.05(D)).

pursuant to the provisions or Section
181.07 , or where any income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit
for the amount so paid in accordance with Section
181.15  hereof, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the
balance, if any shall be due and payable at the time of filing said return.
      (2)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village
is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment
applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election
indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall be refunded
provided that no additional tax or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00)
shall be collected or refunded.
   (e)   (1)   Amended Returns: Where necessary an amended return must be filed
in order to report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a
refund or tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations
contained in Sections
181.11  and
181.15 . Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator, or on a generic form, if the generic form, when completed and
filed, contains all of the required to be submitted with the Village’s
prescribed return. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, such taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the
Village tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
      (3)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support
tax returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within
the time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to
file such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of
this chapter. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten (10) days
after notification by the Tax Administrator, or his authorized representative,
to file the items required by this section.
         (Ord. 2009-31. Passed 6-8-10.)
181.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   In accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the
Administrator, each employer within or doing business within the Village, who
employs one or more persons, shall deduct, when such salary, wage, commission
or other compensation is paid, allocated, apportioned or set aside, the tax of
2.0% of the gross salaries, qualifying wages, commissions or other compensation
due by the said employer to said employee and shall, on or before the fifth day
of the month following the close of each month make a return and pay to the
Administrator the amount of taxes so deducted. Said returns shall be on a form
or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Administrator and shall be subject
to the Rules and Regulations prescribed therefor by the Administrator. Such
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (d)   Such employer in collecting said tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the Village, as a Trustee for the
benefit of the Village and any such tax collected by such employer from his
employee shall, until the same is paid to the Village, be deemed a trust fund
in the hands of such employer.
   (e)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages shall
pay all such tax to the Village in accordance with the provisions of this
section. In the event taxes withheld from the qualifying wages of employees are
not paid to the Village in accordance with the provisions of this section, all
officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and
making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for the tax not
returned or paid to the Village as well as any related interest and penalties,
and are also liable under the provisions of Section
181.12 hereof. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer's,
member's, manager's, employee's, or trustee's liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (f)   Each employer shall file an annual withholding tax reconciliation
showing the sum total of all compensation paid all employees, the portion of
which, (if any) was not subject to withholding along with an explanation for
same, and the portion of which was subject to withholding, together with the
amount of such withholdings remitted. Such return shall include information
concerning each employee from whom the Municipal tax was withheld, showing the
name, address, zip code and social security number of each such employee, the
total amount of compensation paid during the year and the amount of Municipal
tax withheld. If the total tax withheld from any employee-included tax withheld
and remitted to another municipality, the amount of same shall be separately
shown on the return of information to the Municipality concerning each
employee. The withholding tax reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on
or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (g)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the Village when the services were performed in
the Municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and social security number (or federal identification
number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (h)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on the qualifying
wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income paid domestic
servants employed exclusively in or about such person's residence. However,
such domestic servants shall be responsible for filing and paying their own
returns and taxes.

the tax administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in

   (A)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
section
182.052  of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section. An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
         (Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following

be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
          (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this
section shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days
after the last day of each month.    
            (Ord. 2016-28. Passed 11-8-16.)
         (c)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or
regulation. The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division
does not affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any
return as required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
182.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages

corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages

one of the following conditions applies:
      (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in section
182.051  of this Chapter.
            (d)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
   
   (C)   If, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends
performing personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day
threshold described in division (B) of this section, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to that municipal corporation for all days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
   (D)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (E)    Divisions (B) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the

operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
section 3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales
agent conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to
withhold and remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than
qualifying wages as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (C)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator
shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
      (2)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)    A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (5)    If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)    The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)    A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)    A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)    A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)    For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)    For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or
filed late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at
the rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
section
182.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section. (Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)

182.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
182.03 (23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
182.03 (1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section 
182.03 (12) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section
182.062 of this Chapter.   
      (4)   "Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward" is defined in Section
182.03 (33) of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.   
   (A)   This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in Municipality, unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the ORC.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F/A)(2) and (B) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of all
of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, whenever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individuals’s services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
182.04 (C),
         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business
activity in Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
            (i)   Separate accounting;
            (ii)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors.
            (iii)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation.
            (iv)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
182.19 (A).
         (c)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
182.19 (A).
         (d)   Nothing in division (A)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (A)(1)(b) of this section, “wages, salaries,
and other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations.
         (a)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            (i)   The employer.
            (ii)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient.
            (iii)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in (A)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer.
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (A)(3)(a) or (b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (A)(1)(c) of this section, and except
as provided in division (B) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:
         (a)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall

criteria:
            (i)   The property is shipped to or delivered within Municipality
from a stock of goods located within Municipality.
            (ii)   The property is delivered within Municipality from a
location outside Municipality, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within
Municipality and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)   The property is shipped from a place within Municipality to
purchasers outside Municipality, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its
own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales, at
the place where delivery is made.
         (b)   Gross receipts from sale of services shall be sitused to
Municipality to the extent that such services are performed in Municipality.
         (c)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in Municipality shall be sitused to Municipality.
         (d)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in Municipality shall be sitused to
Municipality.
         (e)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to Municipality based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in Municipality.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to Municipality’s tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in Municipality or if the
individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of Municipality.
Municipality shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for
the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this division to the
municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported
by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to Municipality, if
applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions, the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in
Municipality to the commission received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate every where in the taxable year.
         (b)   An individual who is a resident of Municipality shall report the
individual’s net profit from all real estate activity on the individual’s
annual tax return for Municipality. The individual may claim a credit for taxes
the individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under Municipality’s income tax ordinance.
      (7)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (A)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner’s ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (8)   Intentionally left blank.
   (B)   (1)   As used in this division:
         (a)   “Qualifying remote employee or owner” means an individual who is
an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meet both of the following criteria.
            (i)   The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)   The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)   “Qualifying remote work location” means a permanent or temporary
location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to perform
services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the taxpayer or
any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of the taxpayer.
“Qualifying remote work location” may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)   “Reporting location” means either of the following:
            (i)   A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer.
            (ii)   Any location is this state owned or controlled by a customer
or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to withhold
taxes under Section
182.05  of this Chapter
182, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal
services at that location.
         (d)   “Qualifying reporting location” means one of the following:
            (i)   The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year.
            (ii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (B)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee’s or owner’s supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year.
            (iii)   If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (B)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee’s or owner’s
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer’s business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)   For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (A) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
   A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on
or with the taxpayer’s net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed
amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
   The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the Tax Administrator of
each municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment
provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to notify the
   Tax Administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee’s or owner’s qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee’s or
owner’s activity at the qualifying remote work location.
   After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee’s or owner’s qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
   Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election
under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)   For the purposes of calculating the ratios described in division
(A)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (B)(2).
         (a)   For the purpose of division (A)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original costs of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual’s qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual’s qualifying reporting location.
         (b)   For the purpose of division (A)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual’s
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual’s
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)   For the purpose of division (A)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (A)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual’s
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual’s
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
Tax Administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (A)(2) of this section. However, a Tax Administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee’s or owner’s qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section 
182.05  of this Chapter
182. (Ord. 2023-20. Passed 12-12-23.)

purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)    (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax administrator. The tax
administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         (a)    The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)    The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (B)(1)
or (2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder
of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code is
terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code is
binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.   
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
182.03 (1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
182.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit
or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate
taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062
of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-
through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused
to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included,
the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis
of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062  of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
182.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

182.064 TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT FOSTER NEW JOBS IN OHIO.
   The Municipality, by Ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured

filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of estimated taxes. A
taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the tax
administrator. Except as provided in division (F) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the tax administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section

and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the

taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of this first
month of the following taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for
the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or before the
fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety per cent of the
tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
182.091  of this Chapter.
         (a)    For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals

the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section
182.10  of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division
(E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as
follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by

         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
182.091  of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.

declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

182.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
182.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the Municipality who is
required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter/
ordinance may claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the
tax paid to the other municipality. Subject to division (B) of this section,
the credit shall not exceed 100% of the amount obtained by multiplying the
income, qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation
subject to tax in the other municipality by the LOWER of the tax rate in such
other municipality OR the rate of 1.25%. (Ord. 2023-20. Passed 12-12-23.)
   (B)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (A) of this section, "the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by
dividing the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for
that municipality.

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
182.081 of this Chapter.

182.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
182.096, the Municipality may allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section

      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of [Municipality/City/
Village]’s income tax return. The extended due date of [Municipality/City/
Village]’s income tax return shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the
last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For tax years ending

return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the 15th day of the
eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return

      (8)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section

due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the

of an employer, or other payer as described in section
182.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation

with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.

preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination

payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
182.052  of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 2023-20. Passed 12-12-23.)

   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the

extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.

division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.

which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due

month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a written
request that the tax administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of
the date for filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request
is received by the tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income
tax return is due, the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested
extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return. (Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.095 AMENDED RETURNS.

Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the

      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
182.19  of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.

that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section
182.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;

ten dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary
to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent factors on the return will
cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of undocumented credits or
losses.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18  of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A) (4) of Section
182.10 of this Chapter.

of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 2015-32. Passed
11-10-15.)
182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to section
182.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
182.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
182.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)    The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
182.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
182.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator. (Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)    The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)    The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax
Administrator and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)    The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax
Administrator sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested.
The effective date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or
one year after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)    The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)    The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
    (4)    If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)    The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)    The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
182.15  of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)    The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to
change for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
   person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at
the address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.18 BOARD OF TAX APPEALS.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the Municipality,
and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)    Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)    A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
182.18  of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
182.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
           (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition
of that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)
182.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.

pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   The Municipality hereby adopts the Regional Income Tax Agency (RITA)
Rules & Regulations, including amendments that may be made from time to time,
for use as the Municipality's Income Tax Rules and Regulations. In the event of
a conflict with any provisions of the Municipality's Income Tax Ordinance and
the RITA Rules & Regulations, the Ordinance will supersede.   
   (C)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.

except that “taxpayer” does not include natural persons or entities subject to
the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of the ORC. “Taxpayer” may include
receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such persons are required
to assume the role of a taxpayer.
(Ord. 2023-20. Passed 12-12-23.)
182.97 COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so
levied or enforcing any provisions of this chapter are concerned, it shall
continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the
aforesaid period are fully paid and any and all suits and prosecutions for the
collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter have
been fully terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Section
182.19.
 
   (B)    Annual returns due for all or any part of the last effective year of

182.98 SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.
(Ord. 2015-32. Passed 11-10-15.)

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief

including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may be
ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

state highway patrol trooper. If the chief, or state highway patrol trooper
determines that the vehicle cannot be removed within the specified period of
time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under

   (c)   (1)   The chief shall cause a search to be made of the records of an
applicable entity listed in Ohio R.C. 4513.601(F)(1) to ascertain the identity
of the owner and any lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the
chief, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business days of the
removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall
inform the owner or lienholder that the motor vehicle will be declared a
nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle is responsible

vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage
facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;

         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to
the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle. (ORC
4513.64)
303.10 LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession
of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section.
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice. Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.65)
303.11 PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO POLICE OFFICER.

such vehicle in such place. Prior to disposal of an "abandoned junk motor
vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, it shall be photographed by a law
enforcement officer.
      (3)    When any vehicle has been stolen or operated without the consent
of the owner and is located upon either public or private property.
      (4)   When any vehicle displays illegal license plates or fails to
display the current lawfully required plates and is located upon any public
street or other property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or
parking.

property, and is located upon any public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking.
      (7)    When any vehicle is left unattended either on public or private
property due to the removal of an ill, injured or arrested operator, or due to
the abandonment thereof by the operator during or immediately after pursuit by
a law enforcement officer.

stop in case of an accident or collision and is located either on public or
private property.

without a lawful license or while his license has been suspended or revoked and
is located upon a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking.
      (10)    When any vehicle is found for which three or more citation tags
for violations of this Traffic Code have been issued and the owner or operator
thereof has failed to respond to such citation tags as lawfully required, and
is located upon a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking.

303.121 REDEMPTION OF BOOTED VEHICLES.
   (a)    If the vehicle is immobilized by a boot, a notice of the booting
shall be placed on the windshield that explains the reason for booting and the
release procedure. Any person desiring to redeem a booted vehicle shall appear
at the Police Department to furnish satisfactory evidence of identity and
ownership or right to possession. Prior to issuance of a release form, the
claimant, owner or operator shall either pay the amount due for any fines for
violations on account of which such vehicle was impounded or booted or, as the
court may require, post a bond in an amount set by the court, to appear to
answer to such violations. A police officer shall remove the boot after all
applicable fines and fees are paid.
   (b)    An immobilization fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) must be paid
in addition to any outstanding traffic fines and applicable storage costs in

additional fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) will be charged for any check
returned by the bank for insufficient funds or because the account is closed.
   (c)    Parking citations in accordance with Chapter
309 may continue to accrue daily until the immobilization fee and all
outstanding traffic fines are paid.
   (d)    The immobilization device (boot) is the property of the Village and
any damage to
this device shall make the offender liable for the destruction of municipal
property. Removing this device or moving the immobilized vehicle by any means
or in any manner before an official release is obtained constitutes a separate
and additional offense and may subject the offender to criminal penalties.
   (e)    The Village assumes no liability for loss or damage to the vehicle or
its contents while so immobilized.
   (f)    No owner or operator shall remove a boot without complying with the
above procedure. Possession of a vehicle which has been booted and unlawfully
taken, by the owner or operator, shall constitute prima facie evidence that it
was so removed by the owner or operator. Whoever violates this section is
guilty of obstructing justice pursuant to Section
525.08.

      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00),

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the

319.05 of this Chapter.
      (7)    Persons who choose to pay the civil penalty without appearing
before the Portage County Municipal Court as set forth in Codified Ordinance
Section

         (Ord. 2023-23. Passed 11-14-23.)
319.07 CONTESTING TICKETS.
   (a)    When a person or entity named in a Ticket for a civil violation
elects to contest a Ticket, the person or entity shall request a hearing in the
Portage County Municipal Court by completing and filing the appeal form
provided by the Portage County Municipal Court, within the time frame required.
   (b)    The Portage County Municipal Court shall set the matter for a hearing
not sooner than twenty-one (21) days after the filing of the request for
hearing. The Prosecuting Attorney shall litigate the case to a conclusion. The
Court may extend the time period in which a hearing must be conducted upon its
own motion, or either a request for additional time or waiver of time limits by
the person or entity who requested the hearing. Notice of the hearing shall be
provided by the Portage County Municipal Court. The Portage County Municipal
Court shall determine whether a preponderance of the evidence establishes that
a Traffic Law Violation alleged in the Ticket did in fact occur and whether the
person or entity requesting the hearing is the person who was operating the
vehicle at the time of the Traffic Law Violation.
   (c)    (1)    If the Portage County Municipal Court finds that the person or
entity named in the Ticket was not the person who was operating the vehicle at
the time of the violation or receives evidence identifying a Designated Party,
the Court shall provide to Village or its designec, a copy of any evidence
substantiating the identity of the Designated Party.
      (2)    Upon receipt of evidence of the identity of the Designated Party,
Village or its designee may issue a Ticket to the Designated Party. The Village
shall ensure that a Ticket issued under this section conforms with Section
319.04 . The Village or its designec shall send the Ticket by ordinary mail not
later than twenty-one (21) days after receipt of the evidence from the Court of
the identity of the Designated Party.
   (d)    If a Designated Party, who is issued a Ticket under Section
319.04, contests the Ticket by filing a written request for a hearing and does
so not later than thirty (30) days after the mailing date of the Ticket, the
Registered Owner of the motor vehicle shall also attend the hearing. If at the
hearing involving the Designated Party the Portage County Municipal Court
cannot determine the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the
violation, the Registered Owner shall be liable for the violation. The Portage
County Municipal Court shall then issue a written decision imposing liability
for the violation on the Registered Owner and submit it to Village or its
dcsignee and to the Registered Owner. If the Designated Party, also is a
Registered Owner of the vehicle, liability for the violation shall follow the
order of Registered Owners as listed on the title to the vehicle.
   (e)    (1)    The Portage County Municipal Court shall determine whether a
preponderance of evidence establishes that a traffic law violation occurred and
the person requesting the hearing is the party operating the vehicle at the
time of the violation.
         A.   If the Portage County Municipal Court finds by a preponderance of
the evidence that the alleged Traffic Law Violation did in fact occur and that
the person or entity named in the notice of liability is the person who was
operating the vehicle at the time of the violation, the hearing officer shall
issue a journal entry imposing liability for the violation upon the individual
or entity and submit it to the Village of Hiram or its designee and the person
or entity named in the notice of liability.
         B.    If the Portage County Municipal Court finds by a preponderance
of the evidence that the alleged traffic law violation did not occur or did in
fact occur but the person or entity named in the notice of liability is not the
person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the violation, the Portage
County Municipal Court shall issue a journal entry finding that the individual
or entity is not liable for the violation and submit it to the Village of Hiram
or its designee and the person or entity named in the notice of liability.
         C.   If the person who requested the hearing or a representative of
the entity that requested the hearing fails to appear at the hearing, the
Portage County Municipal Court shall determine that the person or entity is
liable for the violation. In such a case, the hearing officer shall issue a
journal entry imposing liability for the violation upon the individual or
entity and submit it to the Village of Hiram or its designee and the person or
entity named in the notice of liability.
   (f)    If the registered owner or designated party chooses to contest the
notice of liability, the Portage County Municipal Court may consider any of the
following as an affirmative defense to a violation upon the defense being
established by a preponderance of the evidence by the registered owner or
responsible party:
      (1)    That the motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle were
stolen before the violation occurred and were not under control or possession
of the registered owner at the time of the traffic law violation. In order to
demonstrate that the motor vehicle or license plates were stolen before the
traffic law violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of
the registered owner at the time of the traffic law violation, the owner must
submit proof that a police report about the stolen motor vehicle or license
plates was filed prior to the traffic law violation or within forty- eight (48)
hours after the traffic law violation occurred.
      (2)    That the motor vehicle was under the custody and/or control of
another person at the time of the violation. In order to establish this, the
owner or responsible person must provide the name and address of the person who
had custody and/or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the traffic law
violation.
      (3)    That this section is unenforceable because the recorded image is
not legible enough to determine the information needed.
      (4)    Evidence, other than that adduced pursuant to Section
319.07 (e)(1), that the registered owner or person named in the notice of
liability was not operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. To
satisfy the evidentiary burden under this subsection, the owner or person named
in the notice of liability shall provide to the Portage County Municipal Court
evidence showing the identity of the person who was operating the motor vehicle
at the time of the traffic law violation, including, but not limited to, the
operator's name and current address, and any other evidence the Portage County
Municipal Court deems pertinent.
      (5)    That the motor vehicle operator was yielding the right-of-way to
an emergency vehicle in accordance with Ohio law, or to a funeral procession.
      (6)    That the vehicle passed through the intersection in order to yield
the right-of-way to either of the following:
         A.   A public safety vehicle or coroner's vehicle in accordance with
section 4511.45 of the Ohio Revised Code; or
         B.   A funeral procession in accordance with Section 4511.451 of the
Ohio Revised Code.
      (7)    At the time and place of the alleged traffic law violation, the
traffic control signal was not operating properly or the traffic law photo-
monitoring device was not in proper position and the recorded image is not of
sufficient legibility to enable an accurate determination of the information
necessary to impose liability.
      (8)    That under consideration of the totality of the circumstances the
person or entity named in the notice of liability is not liable.
   (g)    If the Portage County Municipal Court finds that the person or entity
named in the notice of liability was not operating the motor vehicle at the
time of the violation or receives evidence under Section
319.07(c)(4) identifying the designated party, the Portage County Municipal
Court shall provide it to the Village of Hiram or its designee, along with a
copy of any evidence substantiating who was operating the motor vehicle at the
time of the traffic law violation.
      (1)    Upon receipt of evidence of the responsible party pursuant to this
Section or pursuant to Section
319.03(b), the Village of Hiram or its designee may issue a notice of
liability, with the name and address of the designated party and the
information required by Section
319.04 of this Chapter, to the person that the evidence indicates was operating
the motor vehicle at the time of the violation.
      (2)    A notice of liability issued under this Section
319.07(g), shall be sent by the Village of Hiram or its designee by ordinary
mail no later than twenty-one (21) business days after the receipt of the
evidence from the Portage County Municipal Court. The content of a notice of
liability issued under this subsection shall be the same as set forth in
division (a) of Section
319.04 of this Chapter.
      (3)    If a designated party who was issued a notice of liability under
Section
319.07(e) hereof contests the ticket by filing a written request for an appeal
hearing not later than thirty days after receipt of the notice of liability,
the registered owner of the motor vehicle shall also attend the hearing. If at
the hearing involving the designated party the hearing officer cannot determine
the identity of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation, the
registered owner is liable for the violation. The hearing officer, magistrate,
or judge then may issue a written decision imposing liability for the violation
on the registered owner and submit it to the Village or its designee and to the
registered owner. If the designated party also is a registered owner of the
vehicle, liability for the violation shall follow the order of registered
owners as listed on the title to the vehicle.
   (h)    A person who is named in a notice of liability for a civil violation
may assert a testimonial privilege in accordance with division (D) of Section
2317.02 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (i)   A person or entity found liable for a Ticket may appeal the decision
rendered by the Portage County Municipal Court in accordance with Ohio law.
   (j)   No decision rendered under this Section, and no admission of liability
under this Chapter is admissible as evidence in any other judicial proceeding
in this state, except as is provided in Section
319.10  hereinbelow. (Ord. 2023-23. Passed 11-14-23.)
319.08 CALIBRATION.

such device used in the Village.

Device used by the Village shall provide to the Village a certificate of proper
operation that attests to the accuracy of the device. (Ord. 2023-23. Passed 11-
14-23.)
319.09 OLLECTION OF CIVIL PENALTY.
   (a)    In the event that the Registered Owner or Designated Party fails to
take any action set forth in Section
319.05 or fails to satisfy any liability determined by the Portage County
Municipal Court for the penalties established under this Chapter and the time
to appeal such decision has passed without the filing of an appeal, the Village
may seek to collect the amount due and owing and/or may initiate a civil
enforcement action in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain a judgment
for the civil penalty and any late fees, costs and attorney's fees that may be
imposed under this Chapter and by the Portage County Municipal Court.
   (b)    If a judgment for a civil penalty under this Chapter is not
satisfied, the Village may seek payment on the judgment amount, together with
any applicable interest and cost thereon, in any manner authorized by law. In
addition to any other fees or charges authorized by this Chapter in relation to
the commission of a Traffic Law Violation thereof, a person liable for the

debt, including but not limited to attorney's fees.

R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified

the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described

the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood under this
division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would
be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance withdrawn under
this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved
by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by
the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.

prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)

of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section

provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of subsection (a) or (b) of

section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to

      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

the offense, the court shall impose a class four suspension of the offender’s

by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a driver’s intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an

whose driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is suspended under this section files an appeal regarding

is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving

holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted. If a person is convicted of, pleads
guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a second or

      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under

occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of

summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.
   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Occupant restraining device” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4513.263.

if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a

335.032 USE OF ELECTRONIC WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICE PROHIBITED WHILE
DRIVING.
   (a)   No holder of a temporary instruction permit who has not attained the
age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:

emergency purposes, including an emergency contact with a law enforcement
agency, hospital or health care provider, fire department, or other similar

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor

shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.
4507.35 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a

evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not
be used for the purpose of determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or
(d) of this section has been or is being committed.

Chapter 4734 that states that the child who otherwise would be required to be
restrained under this section has a physical impairment that makes use of a
child restraint system, booster seat or an occupant restraining device
impossible or impractical, provided that the person operating the vehicle has
safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with any
recommendations of the physician, nurse or chiropractor as noted on the
affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is

501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling

commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for

pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the
appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who is convicted of or
pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing, or
possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the
conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to
the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty to the
felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense that
is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the
offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of accounting or
auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court may order
restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or auditing
provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not exceed the
value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the offense. If
the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the court shall hold
an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim, victim’s
representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate disputes
the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of full
restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section 
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor

plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

immediate family.
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.

in danger of drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a
hospital, clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider
whose alcohol and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to Ohio R.C.

subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal
setting by a person who, by education or experience, is competent to provide

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an
aircraft and if the violation creates a risk of physical harm to any person or

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

four feet in width, a minimum of four inches in thickness with reinforcement
optional. All sidewalks at driveways or vehicle entrance and five feet each
side shall be a minimum of six inches in thickness with reinforcement
preferred, but optional. The slope or incline of sidewalks shall not exceed one
and one-half inches per foot. All walks shall have tooled joints and/or sawed
joints every five feet and expansion joints every twenty feet, or when there is
a change in thickness and between day to day pours. All exposed edges shall be
tooled before applying a stiff broom finish. All sidewalks must extend through
a driveway area at the established grade of the adjoining sidewalks. In the
repairing and relaying of old sidewalks and in laying of new sidewalks upon all
streets whereon a grade is not established but upon which some sidewalks are
now laid, such laying and relaying of walks of any such street shall be done to
conform with the grade of the sidewalks as are now laid thereon.
(Ord. 2018-07. Passed 5-15-18.)
901.04 RESPONSIBILITY FOR SIDEWALKS.
   (a)   Sidewalks are desirable in order to enhance the safety of pedestrian
traffic. Accordingly, but subject to the funding provisions set forth in
subparagraph (d) below, the Village shall install sidewalks on all public
thoroughfares, streets and roads. No later than the March Council meeting each
year the Village Administrator shall recommend that year’s sidewalks program.
Public input will be accepted prior to the next Council meeting before plan
approval.
   (b)   Where sidewalks are in need of repair or in cases where sidewalks
existed but are now missing, it shall be the property owner’s responsibility to
make repair and to replace missing portions of sidewalk per the Village
specifications. The Village Administrator or his designee shall have authority
to enforce this section. Council reserves to itself the authority to determine
that replacement of missing portions of sidewalk does not need to be
accomplished. Subject to the funding provisions set forth in subparagraph (d)
below, the Council may repair or install sidewalks, or in cases where sidewalks
existed but are now missing the Council may install sidewalks.
   (c)   On existing streets where no sidewalk is present, Council may
determine that sidewalks shall be installed. In that event, the Village shall
bear a portion of the cost of any sidewalk deemed necessary and the property
owner on the side of the street where the sidewalk is to be placed shall pay
the balance of the cost, up to 50 percent of the total cost.
   (d)   Subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection (c) hereof, and
subject to the availability of Municipal financing to accomplish the
installation or repair of sidewalks the Village Council may determine that it
will bear a greater proportion of the costs, including all of the costs, of
sidewalk installation.
   (e)   On new streets and developments, the Planning Commission shall require
sidewalks meeting these specifications in any site plan at the developer’s
expense.
   (f)   The Village may determine on existing streets where no sidewalks exist
that due to terrain the installation of sidewalks will be cost prohibitive.
(Ord. 2018-07. Passed 5-15-18.)
901.05 APPEAL.
   Any owner who believes the actions of the Village Administrator or his
designee pursuant to this chapter are improper may appeal the decision of the
Village Administrator or his designee to Council. At conclusion of the appeal
hearing, the Council may affirm, modify or rescind the decision of the Village
Administrator or his designee.
(Ord. 2018-07. Passed 5-15-18.)
901.99 PENALTY.

909.01 DEFINITIONS.
   Street Trees: Street trees are defined as trees, shrubs, bushes and all
other woody vegetation on land lying within 4 feet of a curb or sidewalk, or
within 10 feet of a fireplug or overhead utility line within the Village of
Hiram.
(Res. 2001-01. Passed 1-9-01.)
909.02 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (a)   It shall be the responsibility of the Beautification Commission to
study, investigate, counsel and develop and/or update as needed, and administer
a written plan for the suggested care, preservation, pruning, planting,
replanting, removal or disposition of street trees. Such a plan will be
presented to the Village Council and upon their acceptance and approval shall
constitute the official comprehensive city street tree plan for the Village.
The plan will be drafted using the recommendations of a certified arborist or
urban forester.
   (b)   The Commission when requested by the Village, shall consider,
investigate, make finding, report and recommend upon any special matter or
question coming within the scope of its work. (Res. 2001-01. Passed 1-9-01.)
909.03 OPERATION.
   The Commission shall follow its bylaws, and keep minutes of its proceedings.
A majority of the members shall be a quorum for the transaction of business.
(Res. 2001-01. Passed 1-9-01.)
909.04 TREE SPECIES TO BE PLANTED.
   The Commission develops and maintains a list of desirable trees for planting
along streets according to a plan made by a landscape architect and arborist.
The plan is available for public consultation in the Village Hall. Residents
wishing to replace street trees will be encouraged to consult this plan. The
Commission may reimburse one hundred dollars ($100.00) of the cost of
purchasing and planting trees listed in the plan as allowed by the approved
budget. To receive reimbursement, residents must provide a receipt and must
have the planting inspected. Residents may consult a listing maintained in the
Village Hall of desirable trees, with the following categories: small (under 20
feet), medium (20 to 40 feet) and large (over 40 feet).
(Res. 2001-01. Passed 1-9-01.)
909.05 SPACING.
   The spacing of streets trees will be in accordance with the three species
size classes listed in Section 
909.04 , and no trees may be planted closer together than the following: small
trees, 30 feet; medium trees, 40 feet; and large trees 50 feet; except in
special plantings designed or approved by the Commission. The rationale behind
the spacing is to avoid future maintenance problems. (Res. 2001-01. Passed 1-9-
01.)
909.06 DISTANCE FROM CURB AND SIDEWALK.
   Regardless of species, size or anticipated mature growth of the planting, no
tree or shrub shall be planted closer than eight feet to a curb, curb line or
sidewalk, unless recommended by the Beautification Commission in consultation
with the Village Administrator.
(Ord. 2019-10. Passed 5-14-19.)
909.07 DISTANCE FROM STREET CORNERS AND FIREPLUGS.
   No street tree shall be planted within 35 feet of any street corner,
measured from the point of nearest intersecting curbs or curb lines. No street
tree shall be planted within more than 10 feet of any fireplug. The rationale
behind the spacing is safety.
(Res. 2001-01. Passed 1-9-01.)
909.08 UTILITIES.
   No street tree other than those listed as small trees in Section
909.04 may be planted under or within 10 feet of any overhead utility wire. The
rationale behind this policy is both safety and avoidance of future pruning.
(Res. 2001-01. Passed 1-9-01.)
909.09 PUBLIC TREE CARE AFFECTING VILLAGE UTILITIES.
   The Commission shall inform residents of the need to prune, maintain and
remove street trees as may be necessary to insure public safety. The Commission
will report to the Village owned public utilities any tree or part thereof that
is in an unsafe condition or which by reason of its nature is injurious to
Village utilities or Village property for action by the Village utility.
(Res. 2001-01. Passed 1-9-01.)
909.10 TREES ON PUBLIC LAND.
    The Commission will take financial responsibility incurred by the care of
trees on public land belonging to the Village (the Village Hall, parks and
Cemetery) and will set this as the first priority each year. The Commission
will allocate funds for replacement trees as needed on public property. (Res.
2001-01. Passed 1-9-01.)
909.11 STREET TREES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   The Commission may allocate funds remaining for the replacement of street
trees each year based on the recommendations in the Village inventory and the
requests for new planting by homeowners. All trees planted become the full
financial responsibility of the resident or future residents of the property.
(Res. 2001-01. Passed 1-9-01.)
909.12 TOPPING.
   The Commission discourages the topping of any street tree as normal
practice. Topping is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs
larger than three inches in diameter within the tree’s crown to such a degree
as to remove the normal canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged
by storms or other causes, or certain trees under utility wires or other
obstructions where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from
this policy at the determination of the Commission.
(Res. 2001-01. Passed 1-9-01.)
909.13 DEAD OR DISEASED TREE REMOVAL ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   The Commission shall have the right to notify the Village of the need for
pruning of hazardous limbs and for the removal of any dead or diseased street
trees on private property within the Village, when such trees constitute a
hazard to life and property, or harbor insects or disease which constitutes a
potential threat to other trees within the Village. The Commission will notify
in writing the owners of such trees. On an annual basis, the Commission may
request bids for the pruning and removal of street trees according to the plan
developed by the Commission. The cost for pruning or removal of individual
private trees listed in the bid will be sent to the owner. The owner has the
option of taking or refusing this group bid provided by the company hired to
remove trees on public property for the Commission. If the public bid is
rejected, then owners are responsible for pruning or removal. Owners should
bring cases of financial hardship to comply with the Commission within two
months of notification. Removal of stumps will be included within the estimate.
(Res. 2001-01. Passed 1-9-01.)
909.14 PRIVATE FUNDS FOR TREE PLANTING.
   The Commission will accept donations from private individuals to be used for
the replacement of street trees within Hiram Village. The allocation of these
resources will be in accordance with the plans developed on a regular basis by
a certified arborist and as determined by the Commission in consultation with
the Mayor.
(Res. 2001-01. Passed 1-9-01.)
909.15 PUBLIC SEMINARS AND LITERATURE.
   The Commission will make available guidelines for the planting, pruning and
care of trees to all residents of the Village following guidelines established
by the National Arborist Association and the Municipal Arborists and Urban
Foresters Society. The Commission will also hold annual seminars to inform
residents and homeowners of the methods and standards accepted by these
organizations. (Res. 2001-01. Passed 1-9-01.)

the Service Director, except with respect to land controlled by the Board of
Education, in which event such approval shall be obtained from the Crestwood
Board of Education.
(Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.04 BOND; CHARGES; EXCEPTION; RETURN.
   (a)   Bond. No excavation permit shall be issued until the applicant has
deposited with the Fiscal Officer a bond in the amount of the cost of repairs
to the Village street and facilities as estimated by the Service Director/
Superintendent. The bond shall be in the form of a certified check or money
order payable to the Village, or a permit bond issued by an approved surety
company licensed in the State. The purpose of the required bond is to
specifically insure that all excavations are restored in accordance with the
current standards, drawings and specifications on file with the Village. The
minimum bond amount shall be five hundred dollars ($500.00).
   (b)   Charges. The costs incurred by the Village as defined in Section
911.20, for any repair made by the Village for work the permittee fails to
perform or properly perform shall be deducted from the bond on deposit with the
Fiscal Officer. The Service Director/Superintendent shall notify the permittee
that defective workmanship by the permittee has caused the Village to make the
specified repairs and the cost thereof has been deducted from the bond posted
by the permittee. The Fiscal Officer shall notify the permittee of any
additional amount that must be deposited with the Village to cover the cost of
Village made repairs above the amount of the bond and to maintain the bond in
its full amount. Complete compliance with the bond deposit requirement set

a subsequent street opening or excavation permit.
   (c)   Exception. Any homeowner performing work within the public right-of-
way adjacent to the property at which he/she resides shall be exempt from the
bonding requirements of subsection (a) hereof. Any costs incurred by the

Code Chapter 727 and/or 729.
   (d)   Bond Return. All work shall be approved by the Service Director and
Superintendent before a refund of bond money may be made to a permittee. It
shall be the responsibility of the permit holder to obtain required inspections
and to request in writing the return of bond. The permit holder may choose to
keep the bond on file for use on concurrent or subsequent projects provided the
bond amount is adequate to cover repair costs for all permits issued. (Ord. 92-
39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.05 ROUTING OF TRAFFIC.
   The permittee shall take appropriate measures to assure that during the
performance of the excavation work, traffic conditions are maintained as nearly
normal as practicable so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible to the
occupants of the abutting property and to the general public. The Service
Director may permit the closing of streets to all traffic for a period of time
if it is deemed necessary. The permittee shall route and control traffic,
including his/her own vehicles as directed by the Police Department. The
following steps shall be taken before any highway may be closed or restricted
to traffic:
   (a)   The permittee must receive the approval of the Service Director and
the Police Department therefor;
   (b)   The permittee must notify the Fire Chief of any street so closed;
   (c)   Upon completion of construction work, the permittee shall notify the
Service Director and Police Deaprtment before traffic is moved back to its
normal flow so that any necessary adjustments may be made;
   (d)   Where flag persons are deemed necessary by the Service Director, they
shall be furnished by the permittee at his/her own expense. Through traffic
shall be maintained without the aid of detours, if possible. In instances in
which this would not be feasible, the Service Director and Police Department
will designate detours. The Village shall maintain roadway surfaces of existing
highways designated as detours without expense to the permittee but in case
there are no existing highways, the permittee shall construct all detours at
his/her expense and in conformity with the specifications of the Service
Director. The permittee will be responsible for any unnecessary damage caused
to any highways by the operation of his/her equipment. (Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-
12-93.)
911.06 CLEARANCE FOR FIRE EQUIPMENT.
   The excavation work shall be performed and conducted so as not to interfere
with access to the fire station and fire hydrants and connections in accordance
with the Ohio Fire Code. Materials or obstructions shall not be placed within
fifteen feet of fire hydrants. Passageways leading to fire escapes or fire
fighting equipment shall be kept free of piles of material or other
obstructions. (Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.07 PROTECTION OF TRAFFIC.
   The permittee shall erect and maintain suitable timber barriers to confine
earth from trenches or other excavations in order to encroach upon highways as
little as possible. Vehicular crossings shall be steel plate of sufficient size
to span the excavation in the affected lane(s) of traffic and be of sufficient
thickness to support the maximum permissible axle loads established by the Ohio
Department of Transportation (ODOT). The Ohio Fire Code requires temporary
roadways to be of such width, turning radius and vertical clearance to permit
access by Fire Department equipment. The steel plates must support the weight
of a full tanker (GVW 58,000 pounds) and a thoroughfare eighteen (18) feet wide
with a vertical clearance of thirteen (13) feet six (6) inches must be
maintained. The permittee shall construct and maintain adequate and safe
crossings over pedestrian traffic at all street intersections. Pedestrian
crossings shall consist of planking three inches thick, twelve inches wide and
of adequate length, together with necessary blocking. The walk shall be not
less than three feet in width and shall be provided with a railing as required
by the Service Director.
(Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.08 REMOVAL AND PROTECTION OF UTILITIES.
   The permittee shall not interfere with any existing utility without the
written consent of the Superintendent of Utilities and the utility company or
person owning the utility. If it becomes necessary to remove an existing
utility, this shall be done by the owner. No utility owned by the Village shall
be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work be borne by
the permittee. The cost of moving privately owned utilities shall be similarly
borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with the person
owning the utility. The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or
otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in
any way affected by the excavation work and do everything necessary to support,
sustain and protect them under, over, along or across such work. In case any
such pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should be damaged, they shall
be repaired by the agency or person owning them and the expense of such repairs
shall be charged to the permittee and his/her bond shall be liable therefor.
The permittee shall be responsible for any damage done to any public or private
property by reason of the breaking of any water pipes, sewer, gas pipe,
electric conduit or other utility and his/her bond shall be liable therefor.
The permittee shall learn of the existence and location of all underground
utilities and protect the same against damage.
(Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.09 PROTECTION OF ADJOINING PROPERTY.
   The permittee shall at all times and at his/her own expense preserve and
protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations and
taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where, in the protection of
such property, it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose
of taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall obtain a license
from the owner of such private property for such purpose, and if he/she cannot
obtain a license from such owner, the Service Director/Superintendent may
authorize him to enter the private premises solely for the purpose of making
the property safe. The permittee shall, at his/her own expense shore up and
protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged
during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible for all
damage to public or private property or highways resulting from his/her failure
properly to protect and carry out such work. Whenever it may be necessary for
the permittee to trench through any lawn area, either the sod shall be
carefully cut and rolled and replaced or the area shall be graded and seeded
with straw covering after ditches have been back filled as required in this
chapter. All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner
calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition
as nearly as possible to that which existed before any such work began. The
permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any trees or shrubs which exist
in lawnstrip areas or easements across private property without first having
notified and obtained consent of the property owner, or in the case of public
property, the appropriate Village department or Village official having control
of such property.
(Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.10 SIDEWALK EXCAVATIONS.
   Any excavation made in any sidewalk or under any sidewalk shall be provided
with a substantial and adequate footbridge over such excavation on the line of
the sidewalk, which bridge shall be at least as wide as the existing sidewalk
and securely railed on each side so that foot passengers can pass over safely
at all times.
(Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.11 PROTECTIVE MEASURES.
   The permittee shall erect such fence, railing or barriers about the site of
the excavation work as shall prevent danger to persons using the Village
streets or sidewalks, and such protective barriers shall be maintained until
the work shall be completed or the danger removed. At twilight, there shall be
placed upon such place of excavation and upon any excavated materials or
structures or other obstructions to streets suitable and sufficient lights
which shall be kept lit throughout the night during the maintenance of such
obstructions. No person shall remove or tear down the fence or railing or other
protective barriers or any lights provided there for the protection of the
public.
(Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.12 EQUIPMENT SECURITY.
   Permittee shall assure that no machinery, equipment, material or device
shall be left unguarded or unsecured against accidental movement, slippage,
operation or exposure which could result in injury to persons entering the
project area at any time whether or not such entry is authorized. (Ord. 92-39.
Passed 1-12-93.)
911.13 CARE OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL.
   All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or in
any street shall be piled and maintained in such manner as not to endanger
those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and so that
as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and
adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as might
be the case in a narrow street, the Service Director/Superintendent shall have
the authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a
storage site and then haul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling. It
shall be the permittee’s responsibility to secure the necessary permission and
make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal sites.
(Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.14 DAMAGE TO EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS.
   All damage done to existing improvements during the progress of the
excavation work shall be required by the permittee. Permittee is also liable
for damage which is not observed at the time of project completion, i.e.,
hidden damage. Materials for such repair shall conform with the requirements of
any applicable code or ordinance. If, upon being ordered, the permittee fails
to furnish the necessary labor and materials for such repairs, the Service
Director/Superintendent shall have the authority to cause such necessary labor
and materials to be furnished by the Village and the cost shall be charged
against the permittee, and the permittee shall also be liable on the bond
therefor. (Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.15 PROPERTY LINES AND EASEMENTS.
   Property lines and limits of easements shall be indicated on the plan of
excavation submitted with the application for the excavation permit and it
shall be the permittee’s responsibility to confine excavation work within these
limits.
(Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.16 CLEAN-UP.
   As the excavation work progresses, all streets and private properties shall
be thoroughly cleaned of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris
resulting from such work. All clean-up operations at the location of such
excavation shall be accomplished at the expense of the permittee and shall be
completed to the satisfaction of the Service Director/Superintendent. From time
to time, as may be ordered by the Service Director/Superintendent and in any
event immediately after completion of such work, the permittee shall, at his/
her own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any
kind resulting from such work and upon failure to do so within twenty-four
hours after having been notified to do so by the Service Director/
Superintendent, such work may be done by or contracted by the Village and the
cost thereof charged to the permittee, and the permittee shall also be liable
for the cost thereof under the surety bond provided hereunder.
(Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.17 PROTECTION OF WATER COURSES.
   The permittee shall provide for the flow of all water courses, sewers or
drains intercepted during the excavation work and shall replace the same in as
good condition as original or shall make such provisions for them as the
Service Director/Superintendent may direct. The permittee shall not obstruct
the gutter of any street but shall use all proper measures to provide for the
free passage of surface water. The permittee shall cover or otherwise protect
catch basins against entry of dirt, gravel, rock, sand, muck, silt, etc. The
permittee shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water, muck, silt,
slickings or other run-off pumped from excavations or resulting from sluicing
or other operations and shall be responsible for any damage resulting from
failure to so provide. (Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.18 BACKFILLING.
   Backfilling in any street opened or excavated pursuant to an excavation
permit issued hereunder shall be compacted to a degree equivalent to that of
the undisturbed ground in which the trench was dug. Compacting shall be done by
mechanical tappers or vibrators, by rolling in layers, or by water settling, as
required by the soil in question and sound engineering practices generally
recognized in the construction industry. The decision as to whether a trench
shall be backfilled by water settling shall be based upon such engineering
practices and shall be made by the Service Director/Superintendent. When water
is taken from a fire hydrant, the permittee shall assign one man to operate the
hydrant and shall make certain that such man has been instructed by the
Superintendent of Utilities in the operation of the hydrant. The Superintendent
shall likewise be notified at both the beginning and end of the job so that the
condition of the fire hydrants can be checked on both occasions. Any damage
done to a hydrant during the excavation shall be the responsibility of the
permittee. Water shall be paid for by the permittee on the terms agreed upon
with the Superintendent.
   (a)   Backfilling by Water Settling. When backfilling is done by water
settling, excavated materials above utility installations shall be deposited
uniformly in layers of not more than five feet in thickness and shall be
thoroughly flooded. During the flooding the water shall be allowed to flow
slowly to the trench from the high points and shall be worked down to the full
depth of the layer of backfill with bars. All bars used shall be long enough to
extend entirely through the layer being filled and shall be forced down through
the loose backfill material. As the bars are withdrawn the water shall be
allowed to flow downward around the bar. The channel or hold formed by the bar
shall be kept open and the water kept running into it until the fill has
settled. All work shall be done in existing adjacent to the excavation.
   (b)   Dry Backfilling. Backfilling up to the first eighteen inches above the
top of the utility pipes or similar installations shall be done within thin
layers. Each layer is to be tamped by manual or mechanical means. Layers that
are hand tamped shall not exceed four inches in thickness. Layers that are
power tamped shall not exceed six inches in thickness. The same requirements
shall apply to the remainder of the backfilling if tamping is the method used
for backfilling. Backfilling of all pipes of over twenty-four inches in
diameter shall be carried up to the spring line of the pipe in three inch
layers, with each layer moistened and thoroughly tamped with suitable
mechanical equipment.
   Backfilling of excavations which encroach a State Route must meet Ohio
Department of Transportation (ODOT) Specifications 02512, “Low Strength Mortar
Backfill Material”.
(Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.19 RESTORATION OF SURFACE.
   The permittee shall restore the surface of all streets, broken into or
damaged as a result of the excavation work, to its original condition in
accordance with the specifications of the Service Director. The permittee may
be required to place a temporary surface over openings made in paved traffic
lanes. Except when the pavement is to be replaced before the opening of the cut
to traffic, the fill above the bottom of the paving slab shall be made with
suitable material well tamped into place. (Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.20 VILLAGE’S RIGHT TO RESTORE SURFACE.
   If the permittee has failed to restore the excavation work (
911.01(f)) or the work described in (
911.02(a)) or restore the surface of the street to its original and proper
condition upon the expiration of the time fixed by such permit or otherwise has
failed to complete the excavation work covered by such permit, the Village
shall have the right to do or contract for all work and things necessary to
restore the street and to complete the excavation work. The permittee shall be
liable for the actual cost thereof and twenty-five percent of such cost in
addition for general overhead and administrative expenses. The Village shall
have a cause for action for all fees, expenses and amounts paid out and due it
for such work and shall apply in payment of the amount due it any funds of the
permittee deposited as herein provided and the Village shall also enforce its
rights under the permittee’s surety bond pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.21 EMERGENCY ACTION.
   In the event of any emergency in which a sewer, main conduit, or utility in
or under any street breaks, bursts or otherwise is in such condition as to
immediately endanger the property, life, health or condition as to immediately
endanger the property, life, health or safety of any individual, the person
owning or controlling such sewer, main conduit or utility, without first
applying for and obtaining an excavation permit hereunder, shall immediately
take proper emergency measures to cure or remedy the dangerous conditions for
the protection of property, life, health and safety of individuals. However,
such person owning or controlling such facility shall apply for an excavation
permit not later than the end of the succeeding day during which the Village
office is open for business and shall not proceed with permanent repairs
without first obtaining an excavation permit hereunder.
(Ord. 92-39. Passed 1-12-93.)
911.22 NOISE.
   Each permittee shall conduct and carry out the excavation work in such
manner as to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and annoyance to the general
public and occupants of neighboring property. The permittee shall take
appropriate measures to reduce to the fullest extent practicable all noise
associated with the excavation. Excavation may only be performed during the
hours of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Excavation work may not be performed on a
Sunday, unless with the express written permission of the Village
Administrator, or his designee, and then only in case of an emergency. (Ord.

925.01 AUTHORITY.
   The Village Administrator shall have full charge of the Water Department,
including power and authority to provide for prudent and efficient management
and protection thereof.
(Ord. 2007-7. Passed 8-14-07.)
925.02 SERVICE CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   No person, firm or corporation shall tap into the Village Water System
without first securing the proper permits and paying the established fees as
set forth in the current ordinances.
This permit will be the authority for connecting service lines to the Village
water system, which must be subject to regulations of the Village
Administrator. Materials used for service lines must be approved by the
Department before installation. Materials used between the Village main and
curb valve must be "K" copper or ductile iron pipe. Materials used from the
curb valve to the premises to be supplied with water shall be "K” copper, NSF
approved PE-3406 class 160 polyethylene water tubing, ductile iron pipe
designed in accordance with AWWA Cl50 and thickness class 50 or PVC plastic
pipe designed in accordance with AWWA C900 having a Dimension Ratio of 18
(pressure class 150).
   (b)   Fire hydrants shall be Mueller Centurion 200 Model A-421 or A-423,
unless otherwise specified by Administrator.
   (c)   Connections to Existing Mains.  
      (1)   New mains shall be connected to existing mains using proper
fittings. Connections shall be made in a manner acceptable to the Village
Administrator. No cut-ins or connections to existing mains shall be made unless
at least 48 hours notice of such work is given to the Administrator of the
water works system and the related portion of the new main has been disinfected
and all testing completed, as subsequently specified.
      (2)   One day prior to shutting valves on existing lines, the Contractor
shall notify all affected property owners and the Administrator of such shut-
off. The shut-off time shall be kept to a minimum and shall be made at off-peak
hours.
      (3)   The operation of all existing valves shall be accomplished by a
representative of the Hiram Village Water Department. The Contractor shall not
operate existing valves.
      (4)   The Village of Hiram assumes no responsibility for any delay
occasioned by special requirements of conditions which must be met in making
connections.
      (5)   Extreme care shall be taken in making such connections to prevent
contamination of the existing mains. Before making cut-ins or connections to
existing mains, all fittings, valves and pipe shall be washed with clean water
and then disinfected by washing with a chlorine solution having a residual
chlorine strength of not less than 50 ppm.
      (6)   All such work shall be planned so as to reduce the number of shut-
offs to a minimum.
      (7)   Plugs removed from the existing mains may be re-used within the
project and those remaining after completion of construction shall remain the
property of the Village of Hiram.
   (d)   Disinfection. As previously specified, all pipe interiors shall be
cleaned before laying and shall be kept clean thereafter. After a main has been
completed, it shall be disinfected in accordance with AWWA C651-86,
"Disinfecting Water Mains", using the tablet or continuous feed method, and the
following:
      (1)   For the tablet method, an average chlorine dose of 25 ppm shall be
provided by placing 5 gram calcium hypochlorite tablets in the main as it is
being installed. Tablets shall be placed in each section of pipe, with the
number of tablets determined by the formula 0.0012d2L rounded to the next
highest integer, where "d" is the inside diameter of the pipe in inches, and
"L" is the length of the pipe section in feet, and also, one tablet shall be
placed in each hydrant branch and other appurtenances. Tablets shall be
attached using Permatex No. l or equal adhesive on only the side attached and
so that they are at the inside top of the pipe upon installation of the pipe,
and with approximately equal numbers of tablets at each end of a given pipe
length. When installation of the pipe is complete, the main shall be filled
with potable water at a rate such that water within the main will flow at a
velocity no greater than 1 fps. Precautions shall be taken to assure that air
pockets are eliminated. The water shall remain in the pipe for at least 24
hours.
      (2)   For the continuous feed method, the main shall be flushed as
thorough as possible with the water pressure and outlets available and all air
exhausted. If no hydrant is installed at the end of the main, a tap large
enough to develop a velocity in the main of at least 2.5 fps shall be provided
by the Contractor. Disinfection can be accomplished by injecting a l% chlorine
solutions (10,000 ppm), prepared by mixing one pound of calcium hypochlorite
(approximately 65% available chlorine by weight) and 8 gallons of water, into
the main at a point not more than 10 feet downstream from the beginning of the
new main.
      (3)   Potable water for the injector for delivering the 1% chlorine
solution shall be pumped from a cleaned and sterilized container. Water from
the existing distribution system or other approved potable water source shall
be controlled so as to flow slowly into the new main during chlorine
application, with the rate of chlorine application in such proportion to the
rate of water entering the main that the solution of clean water and chlorine
in the main will have not less than 25 ppm free chlorine. The solution shall
remain in the main for 24 hours, at which time the treated water in all
portions of the main shall have a residual of not less than 10 ppm free
chlorine.
      (4)   For all methods, after the applicable retention period, the main
shall be thoroughly flushed out with potable water from the distribution system
until the main has approximately the same chlorine content as water in the
existing system.
      (5)   Air shall be exhausted at the fire hydrant, and 1 inch corporation
stop inserted at the end of the main. The Contractor shall provide all
corporation stops required for exhausting air, for samples for testing for
chlorine residual, and for chlorine solution injection. In all cases, tests for
chlorine residual will be performed by the Village Water Department personnel.
      (6)   During all flushing and disinfection operations, existing valves
shall be manipulated so that strong chlorine solution in the main being treated
will not flow back into the line supplying the water, and the new valve and
hydrant shall be operated so as to disinfect appurtenances and pipe branches.
      (7)   Bacteriological samples shall not be taken for testing until the
main has been subjected to a successful pressure and leakage test.
      (8)   Disinfection is a responsibility of the Contractor, who shall
provide all materials, labor and equipment and, in addition, pay for the total
volume of water used and dispose of all heavily chlorinated water.
   (e)   Pressure and Leakage Test. After the main has been disinfected and
flushed out, it shall be subjected to a pressure and leakage test in accordance
with AWWA C600-82 and the following:
      (1)   The main shall be isolated from adjacent main and pressure shall be
applied by pumping clean water from a sterilized container into the main via 1
inch corporation stops. The test pressure shall be 150 pounds per square inch
(psi), and shall not vary more than ±5 psi.
      (2)   The pressure test shall be started in an afternoon and the pressure
shall be on for 18 hours, and then, the test pressure shall be maintained for
an additional two hours by pumping water from the container. At the end of the
two hour period, the water used shall be measured and the loss by leakage shall
not exceed that as determined by the following formula:
L = SD (P)l/2
133,200
in which "L" is the allowable leakage in gallons per hour; "S" is the length of
the pipe tested in feet; "D" is the nominal diameter of the pipe in inches; and
"P" is the average test pressure during the leakage test in pounds per square
inch gauge.
      (3)   The test shall be made with the hydrant in the closed position.
      (4)   If the main and valves do not pass the leakage test, the leak or
leaks shall be located and repaired and the testing procedure repeated by and
at the expense of the Contractor. All visible leaks shall be repaired
regardless of the amount of leakage.
      (5)   Pressure and leakage testing is a responsibility of the Contractor,
who shall provide all materials, labor and equipment and, in addition, pay for
the total volume of water used.
   (f)   Bacteriological Tests. After the main bas been disinfected and tested,
and before it is placed in service, bacteriological tests shall be performed in
accordance with Section
7 of AWWA C601, and the following:
      (1)   Samples will be collected from the extremities and midpomt of the
main by a representative of the Village Water Department and bacteriological
tests performed. Samples shall not be taken by the Contractor. At least two
samples taken at 24 hour intervals shall show the water to be safe.
      (2)   Before a sample is taken, the water shall be allowed to p.ow from
the sampling point for at least one minute. The outlet shall be thoroughly
flamed in order to kill all bacteria. Nothing should be allowed to touch the
lip or top of the sample bottle while the sample is being taken.
      (3)   If bacteriological tests show the water to be safe, the main may be
placed in service. If bacteriological tests show the water to be unsafe, the
main shall be completely disinfected again at the expense of the Contractor.
      (4)   The Contractor shall be responsible for all costs of
bacteriological tests.
   (g)   Completion of Tests. When all tests on the water main have been
successfully completed, the main will be placed in service by the Village of
Hiram Water Department and no further work on the main or its valves will be
permitted without full knowledge of the work by the Authority. (Ord. 2007-7.
Passed 8-14-07.)
925.03 METERS.
   (a)   Water will be supplied only through approved meters installed by an
authorized representative of the Village Administrator. Each single family
dwelling shall have separate meters and curb boxes for each family unit. New
multi-family dwellings and condominiums shall be served by a single tap-in and
meter unless otherwise permitted for good cause shown by the Village
Administrator. Each separate building or structure in a multi-family
development or condominium complex shall have separate water service with
separate meter and curb boxes with shut-off valve. All accounts will be carried
in the name of the owner of the property being served. Any exceptions must have
the approval of the Village Administrator.
   (b)   Property owners will be billed for all water passing through the meter
and shall be solely responsible for leaks and other wastes in the lines and
fixtures to which water service is furnished, including the service line
extending from the curb valve to the water meter.
   (c)   Meters will be furnished and set by the Water Department, provided the
property owner furnishes a suitable place. The space occupied by the meter must
at all times be kept free from rubbish or debris that will prevent personnel
from gaining access to the meter. All meters must be installed horizontally,
with a ball valve on each side of the meter and in a place that is free from
frost. The Water Department will not be liable for any damages caused by frozen
pipes or meters inside the curb lines. A meter vault may be installed only
after approval of the Water Department. The location, depth and type of meter
vault used shall be approved by the Department before installation. Consumers
shall protect all meters from freezing, hot water and injury of any kind.
Meters will not be removed for any reason except by personnel of the
Department. If it is found that a meter seal has been broken or if there is
evidence that the meter has been tampered with, the meter will be removed and
water service discontinued until all charges and expenses have been paid. This
will include the turn-on charge, meter repair and a charge for the water used
as estimated by the Village Administrator.
   (d)   Water meters may be removed for tests, cleaning and repair whenever
deemed necessary by the Department. The Village Administrator may test any
meter, and if found to vary 2% or more from the correct amount, the meter will
be repaired or replaced. If a consumer desires a test of his meter, he shall
make the request to the Village Administrator in writing. A test will be made
under the supervision of the Administrator and if the test shows that the meter
over registers by as much as 2%, a proper adjustment will be made in the
billing. A service charge will be made if the test shows that the meter does
not over register. Consumers requesting a meter reading, due to a vacating of
premises or suspension of service shall notify the Village Administrator at
least 24 hours prior to desired meter reading. A billing will be rendered
promptly after final meter reading.
(Ord. 2007-7. Passed 8-14-07.)
925.04 RATES AND BILLING.
   (a)   The rates charged for water consumed shall be set and established by
the Village Council upon the recommendation of the Village Administrator. So
far as practicable, meters will be read monthly and bills will be rendered
monthly. A schedule of rates is on file with the Village Administrator and is
available upon request. A charge shall be made for each turn-on made at the
consumer's request if made necessary by reason of failure to make payments as
provided herein or through violation of any of the provisions in these
regulations.
   (b)   All bills shall be due and payable within 21 days of the billing date
and if not paid, shall be subject to a 10% penalty charge. If at the end of 60
days from the date of billing, a water bill shall remain unpaid, the Village
Administrator will order the water service discontinued to the property
involved unless a payment agreement has been made with the Village
Administrator. Service will remain discontinued until past due amount has been
paid in full, unless arrangements have been made with the Village
Administrator. Water rent shall be a lien on the property supplied, and if not
paid as herein provided, the same shall be collectable as other taxes and
assessments are collected, and the Fiscal Officer is hereby directed to certify
to the Auditor of Portage County such delinquent accounts with a description of
the premises, and the Auditor shall place the same on the duplicate according
to law.
   (c)   In the event that a meter ceases to operate during a current billing
period, an estimated bill will be prepared based on the last three (3) regular
readings of the meter. If the meter reader cannot gain access to the property
to read the meter, the Village Administrator is authorized to prepare an
estimated bill based on the last three (3) readings.
(Ord. 2007-7. Passed 8-14-07.)
925.05 GENERAL PROVISIONS.

   (c)   The Authority bearing proper credentials and identification shall
present them to the owner, agent or present occupant of properties within the
Authority before entering for the purpose of inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling and testing, in accordance with the provisions contained
herein. The Authority shall also obtain and present a proper search warrant if
the owner, agent or present occupant requests one. A request by the owner,
agent or present occupant that the Authority obtain a search warrant is an
exercisable right of the requesting party and shall not constitute failure to
cooperate nor shall it constitute a failure to comply with the provision
herein. The Authority shall have no right to inquire into any processes,
including metallurgical, chemical, oil, refining, ceramic, paper or other
industries beyond the point of having a direct bearing on the kind and source
of discharge into the sewers or waterways to facilities for waste treatment.
(Ord. 2007-7. Passed 8-14-07.)
927.10 LIMITING SEWER CONNECTIONS.
   The Authority shall limit connections into sewer lines if sufficient
capacity to handle and treat additional wastewater is unavailable in the
system.
   (a)   Any person applying for a permit to connect to a public sewer shall
provide, with the application for said building sewer permit, sufficient data,
as required by the Authority, regarding the location, type of wastewater and
amount of flow to be conveyed to the public sewer.
   (b)   Any costs associated with additional charges herein shall be borne by
the person applying for the building sewer permit.
      (Ord. 2007-7. Passed 8-14-07.)
927.11 INJURY AND DAMAGE OF SEWAGE WORKS.
   No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break,
damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or
equipment which is part of the sewage disposal system. Any person violating
this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under a charge of
disorderly conduct and shall be required to make restitution for said damages.
(Ord. 2007-7. Passed 8-14-07.)
927.12 DEFICIT PROHIBITED.
   As part of the annual review provided herein, the Authority or other
representative shall make an estimate of the revenues and expenses for the next
year. After deducting the estimated operation and maintenance costs, the
estimated debt service cost, and the repair and replacement reserve payment
from the total estimated revenues and net carryover from the previous years,
the system shall maintain a positive working capital.
(Ord. 2007-7. Passed 8-14-07.)
927.13 USE OF REVENUE.
   The funds received from the collections of the rates and charges provided in
this chapter shall be deposited as received by the Authority into a separate
fund designated as the "Hiram Village Sewer Fund". Disbursements from the fund
may be made for operation and maintenance costs, debt service costs, and
payments to a Sewer Replacement and Repair Fund.
(Ord. 2007-7. Passed 8-14-07.)
927.14 FREE SERVICE PROHIBITED.
   Service will be provided to the users of the system in accordance with the
terms of this chapter. No user shall be provided service without payment of
sewer service charges in proportion to the service available to such user. No
one, including the Authority, shall subsidize the cost of operation,
maintaining or replacement of the sewage disposal system.
(Ord. 2007-7. Passed 8-14-07.)
927.15 BASE USER CHARGE.
   Charges for wastewater services shall be determined in accordance with the
terms of this chapter and shall not be provided without charge to any users.
User charges may be determined on the basis of Equivalent Dwelling Unit (EDU)
(as shown by the records of the Authority) times the applicable user charge
rate. User charges may also be based on metered water consumption with rates
determined by the Village Administrator and approved by Village Council. In
either case, user charges will be proportionate to the sewage disposal system
operation, maintenance and replacement cost incurred plus a charge to recover
the proportionate share of capital costs for sewage treatment plant
improvements. If fixed sewer service charges are used instead of being based on
metered water consumption, such charges shall consist of the sum of the
Operation, Maintenance and Replacement Rate, the Debt Service Charge Rate and
the surcharge rate (if applicable) calculated as follows:
   (a)   Operation, Maintenance and Replacement Rate (OMR.). A proportionate
rate for the operation, maintenance and replacement of the sewage disposal
system shall be charged to all users based upon the following formula:
         OMR=A/EDU
   Where A =Total annual operation, maintenance and Replacement costs for the
wastewater treatment plant and collection system.
         EDU= Total number of Equivalent Dwelling Units (EDU) of the system.
   (b)   Debt Service Charge Rate DSC. The proportionate rate for repayment of
all capital costs associated with the original construction of the sewage
disposal system shall be charged to all users based upon the following formula:
         DSC=B/EDU
Where B =Total amortized annual debt service payments fur all original
construction of the sewage disposal system
EDU= Total number of Equivalent Dwelling Units (EDU) of the system.
   (c)   Sewage Surcharge Rate SSR. The proportionate rate for payment of the
cost to treat wastewater discharge containing concentrations of BOD as SS
higher than those expressed in the definition of normal domestic wastewater
shall be based upon the following formula:
         SSR-BOD or SSR- SS =C x D
         Where C = Additional pounds of BODS or SS
      D= Current cost per pound to treat normal BOD or SS loads (this amount is
currently defined at $ 0.38/lb for BOD and $0.14 lb. for SS)
      (Ord. 2007-7. Passed 8-14-07.)
927.16 DETERMINATION OF CHARGES.
   If fixed sewer charges are used, the monthly sewer service charge for each
user shall be calculated by multiplying the currently adopted User Charge (and
amortized Capital Improvements Charge) determined under Section
927.15 by the number of EDU's assigned to the user in accordance with currently
adopted chart of User Categories and EDU criteria. If the user has paid all or
part of the initial portion of unamortized CIC (Capital Improvements Charge) in
advance, CIC will be reduced or eliminated for that user.
(Ord. 2007-7. Passed 8-14-07.)
927.17 ANNUAL REVIEW OF USER CHARGES.
   (a)   Pursuant to U.S. EPA regulations, user charges shall be reviewed
annually to accomplish the following purpose:
      (1)   To maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and
maintenance and replacement costs among users and user classes; and
      (2)   To generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation,
maintenance, replacement, capital and working capital costs of the sewage
disposal system.
   (b)   The annual review of the user charges shall be conducted by the
Authority or by consulting engineer. A written report shall be prepared and
submitted to the Village Council on or before March 1st of each year. The
report shall summarize actual operations for the year just ended and, based
upon at least two years’ projections (the current year and the next year),
shall recommend a rate increase or decrease effective September 1st of the
current year. At the time recommended in the report, the Village shall, by
appropriate ordinance, set the schedule of rates and charges for the users of
the system.
   (c)   In addition to the authority of the Village Council to increase or
decrease rates on September 1st of each year, the Council may, at any time,
increase or decrease rates if the Council determines a modification of the
rates is required in order to comply with regulation, any revenue bond
resolution, or to adjust rates to reflect final costs.
   (d)   Following the annual review, the Authority shall promptly notify each
user, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate adjustments, if any, and
that portion of the sewer service charge which is attributable to operation,
maintenance and replacement costs of the system.
(Ord. 2007-7. Passed 8-14-07.)

create temporary financial hardships, payment arrangements may be considered by
the Village Administrator.
      (2)   The Village Administrator may create special user charges for waste
of unusual strength or composition entering into the sewer system, providing
its composition strength is not prohibited by this chapter. (See
927.06(c)(2) and
927.06(f)(2)), as examples.
   (c)   Creation of Account. Immediately upon the acceptance of an application
for a supply of water or sewer service, the Authority will open an account in
the name of the owner of the premises, giving the account number. If the
premise is a rental property, the account will also carry the name of the
tenant when said name is supplied. At the option of the Authority bills may be
mailed to the tenant. All bills against the premises shall be charged and all
payments shall be credited on the books of the Authority to the account of the
Owner according to said account number.
   (d)   Payment by Tenant. If the owner of any premises so elects, he may have
his tenant or lessee pay the bills and/or miscellaneous charges as they accrue.
However, such tenant or lessee does so as the agent of the owner and such owner
is not thereby relieved from the payment of any bills that might accrue. The
owner is furthermore responsible for providing the names of tenants to the
Authority.
   (e)   Non-payment of Bills. Water may not be supplied to, and it may be
turned off from, any premises the owner of which is delinquent in the payment

to be utilized for human occupancy as a residence or place of employment and
the Authority shall not bill for sewer service.
(3)   Violation of subsection (g)(2) hereof will subject the owner to the
mandatory connection provisions of this chapter and Ohio law.
      (4)   A person or subsequent owner of a property disconnected who
disconnects from the sewage disposal system may later request to be
reconnected. Upon approval by the Authority, the Authority shall reopen sewer
connections and/or replace publicly owned equipment.
      (5)   The charge for disconnection or reconnection shall be paid to the
Authority before performance of the work.
      (6)   The owner or representative shall be present at the time of
disconnection or reconnection in order to provide necessary access to
electrical and plumbing facilities.
   (h)   Service Disconnected at Main. Any service which has been out of use
continuously for a period of at least one year may be disconnected at the main
by the Authority and the cost of such disconnecting, including street repaving,
may be charged against the Owner.
   (i)   Charge for Water Found On. Where water has been turned off for any
reason, it shall be so recorded, and the charge for the water and sewer ceases
from that date. However, wherever water is found turned on to a service,
recorded as turned off on the records of the Authority, the account shall be
charged for the use of water and sewer from the recorded date of the turning
off the service.
   (j)   Changes of Address or Ownership.  
      (1)   Upon the change of his or her mailing address, an owner of property
serviced by the sewage disposal system shall inform the Authority, in writing,
of the change. Failure to inform the Authority, if a change of address shall
not excuse an owner from any payment penalties incurred because of the failure
to report an address change.
      (2)   Prior to the sale of a property, the purchaser shall contact the
Authority to arrange for a pro-ration of the first bill and to inform the
Authority of the mailing address of the new owner. Failure to comply with this
part shall not excuse the new owner from the responsibility for any and all
delinquencies certified pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code, current charges,
and/or charges or penalties remaining unpaid by tbe previous owner.
   (k)   Billing and Delivery.  Every account shall be charged and billed
separately except as provided in the schedule of rates. The Authority will
deliver bills for water, sewer, and miscellaneous charges by depositing same in
the Post Office only as a matter of convenience to the Owner. Failure to
receive bills shall not relieve any Owner from his obligation in the payment of
such bills or constitute a claim for discount.
   The billing procedures shall be as follows:
      (1)   Bill is mailed on or about the first day of the month. It is due on
the last banking day of the month.
      (2)   On the first day of the next month new bill is sent showing
previous balance plus amount of new bill.
      (3)   15 days later,
         A.   Any accounts with past due balance remaining from previous month
are sent a shut-off notice, stating that if by the end of the month past due
amount is not paid and no request has been made for special arrangements and/or
payment agreement has not been signed, water will be shut off. Notice states
that property owner, if different from person being billed, will be notified of
the delinquent account.
         B.   Property owner, if different from person being billed, receives a
copy of shut-off notice and reminder that property owner is responsible for
payment of the bill.
         C.   A payment agreement may be signed. It will require an initial
partial payment and provision for regular payments to catch up in no more than
six months. In special circumstances, extensions may be granted by the Village
Authority. The payment agreement will state clearly the conditions stated in
subsection (k)(5) hereof. All current charges will be paid when due in addition
to the payment plan.
         D.   A customer may submit a written petition or may request a hearing
before the Authority to appeal a bill, to explain hardships preventing bill
payment, to request a waiver of penalty due to special hardship or to request
an extension on a payment agreement.
      (4)   About 15 days later, when account is 30 days delinquent, water is
shut off at the convenience of the Authority.
         A.   Once the water has been shut off, it may not be turned on until
all current and back due water and sewer charges are paid in full.
         B.   A water on/off fee will be charged before the water is turned on.
This fee may be waived by the Authority for extenuating or extreme hardship
circumstance.
      (5)   If a water and sewer payment agreement is signed and accepted in
subsection (k)(3)C. hereof the following conditions apply:
         A.   If the promised make up payments are ten days late from the
agreed payment date, water will be shut off at the earliest convenience of the
Authority.
         B.   A notice of the water shut off and a bill for the total amount
will be mailed to the customer and the property owner.
         C.   The water will not be turned on unless the total past and current
due for all water and sewer charges are paid in full or unless approved by the
Village Authority for extenuating or extreme hardship circumstances.
      (6)   If all these collection procedures fail, the unpaid balance will be
placed on the tax duplicate of the property owner.
      (7)   The Village and the Village Authority will not be responsible for
the damages or hardship which may result from turning off or turning on water,
whether or not the occupant is notified.
   (l)   Collection Responsibility. The Authority will make every possible
effort to collect bills as promptly as the nature and volume of work will
permit, but no owner shall be relieved from any obligation for payment of bills
that may be unpaid through failure of the Authority to make collections as
provided by its rules.
   (m)   Reading for Billing. Reading for bills shall be taken monthly when
possible. If a monthly reading is missed, monthly bills may be estimated based
on past readings. When closing the account meter shall be read with no fee.
   The Authority shall determine the actual amount of rents due based upon an
actual reading of each customer's meter at least once each three month period,
and at least quarterly the Authority shall render a bill for the actual amount
shown by the meter reading to be due, except estimated bills may be rendered if
access to a customer's meter was unobtainable for a timely reading.
   When property to which service is provided is about to be sold, any party to
the sale or his agent may request the Authority to read the meter at the
property and to render within ten days following the date on which the request
is made, a final bill for all outstanding rents and charges for services. Such
a request shall be made at least fourteen days prior to the transfer of the
title of such property.
   (n)   Adjustments. The amount of water registered by any meter shall be
charged and paid for in full, irrespective of wherever such water, after having
been registered, was lost by leakage, accident or otherwise, except that water
used in extinguishing fires will not be billed. When meters fail to register
correctly, and during the time meters are removed for test or repairs, the
charges for water will be assessed on an estimated amount based upon the
average consumption shown when meter is in proper working order.
   When, upon examination, meters fail to register or the accuracy does not
meet the requirements of the Authority, the account history will be examined
for a period of one year preceding testing, repair, or replacement of the
meter. Should there be a marked difference in consumption as shown by a
defective meter and one in good repair, an additional charge or credit for
under or over registration of meter for one year shall be made.
   (o)   Account Credit. An account credit on a bill can be made only for one
of the following reasons:
      (1)   Where an error has been made in the reading of the meter, or the
preparation of the bill.
      (2)   When the meter, upon text, shows an average over registration
greater than A.W.W.A. standards.
      (3)   When any charge of the Authority has been paid twice or
incorrectly.
   The original receipted bill or copy must accompany the application for an
account credit. In general, all overpayments will be credited to the account.
   (p)   Complaints for Overcharge.  
      (1)   Owners or agents are to advise the Authority of complaints
concerning any bill by calling Village Hall within ten (10) days of the due
date appearing on the bill. A clerk at that number will log the name, address,
date and complaint. If the owner or agent is not satisfied with the
explanation, the owner or agent may request a hearing before the Village
Administrator.
      (2)   Failure to call within the ten (10) day period, followed by failure
to pay prior to the service turnoff date will result in service turnoff without
further notice.
      (3)   As an alternative, an owner or agent may give written notice of
such complaint, postmarked within the ten (10) day period, addressed to the
Authority, Box 65, Hiram, OH 44234, Attention: Complaints, Water and Sewer
Billing.
      (4)   The Village and Authority assumes no responsibility as to whether
the bill is or is not being received by the party charged with responsibility
to pay.
      (5)   Any complaint shall be handled initially by calling 569-7860.
Thereafter, the complaint may be referred to the Manager of Utilities. If the
dispute is not then resolved, the Manager of Utilities may advise that a
hearing be requested with the Village Administrator.
      (6)   A person is not entitled to a hearing if notice has not been given
within the ten (10) day period. The personnel under the Village Administrator
will, however, attempt to resolve all complaints made before the turnoff date.
   (q)   Partial Payments. Payments for combined utility billings will be
applied in the following manner:
      (1)   All arrearages to water, sewer and miscellaneous water and sewer
charges, including arrearages, shall be applied on a pro rata basis. Partial
payments will be accepted only under unusual and extraordinary circumstances or
pursuant to collection procedures.
   (r)   Bill Payment.
      (1)   All payments to the Authority shall be in currency or by check
drawn to the order of the Village of Hiram. All checks will be accepted subject
to collection at the Village Hall, and the banks that accept payments.
      (2)   If a person pays for water, sewer, or other charges with a check
that is returned for insufficient funds, a charge of (See Chapter
929) will be added to that account and become due and payable in accordance
with other charges as provided by this chapter.
      (3)   If a person has two checks returned for insufficient funds, the
Authority may require all future payments to be made in cash or money order.
      (4)   Upon the claim of a person that the return of a check for
insufficient funds was bank error, the Authority may waive the insufficient
funds charge (See Chapter
929) and/or accept payment by check if the bank supplies adequate documentation
of its error.
   (s)   Bill Period.
      (1)   The period covered by a bill, except final bills will terminate as
of date of bill.
      (2)   In computing partial bills, either on consumption or time basis,
date of meter reading will be used as the fixed date for starting or ending of
the billing period, except that final bills terminating within ten days after
date of bill may be billed as of bill date. Likewise, new accounts opened
within this period may be billed from start of normal billing period.
      (3)   Final bills termination within ten days before the end of the
normal billing period may be computed upon the basis of the regular meter
reading obtained for the billing if the account.
   (t)   Shut Down of Water Facilities. Before a main is turned off, either for
repairs or alterations, all consumers affected may be notified. Notice shall be
considered to have been given if some persons at each address have been told
either in person or in writing, of such action. The Village and the Authority
will not be responsible for damages or hardship which may result from turning
off or turning-on of the water whether or not occupant is notified.
   In case of breaks in mains, services, pumping and auxiliary machinery,
reservoir or other water works equipment, the water may be shut off when
necessary without notice. No claim will be allowed for damages arising from the
turning off or turning on of the water.
   (u)   Discontinuance of Supply of Water. The supply of water through any
service may be turned off by the Authority for any one or more of the following
causes:
      (1)   For the use of water on any premises other than that included in
the application, except as herein provided.
      (2)   For willful waste of water through improper, imperfect or worn out
pipes, fixtures or otherwise. Water lost or wasted from worn out or broken
pipes or fixtures between the Village tap in and the consumer's water meter
(not on Village Property) is to be paid for by the property owner. This amount
will be determined by an employee of the Authority as the most reasonable
estimate of loss based on probable gallons of flow per hour over the time
period the loss was known to have occurred. Failure for the property owner to

"Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of Pollutants", and shall
be determined at the control manhole provided or upon suitable samples taken at
such control manhole.
   (d)   In the event that no special manhole has been required the control
manhole shall be considered to be the manhole at which the building sewer is
connected to the public sewer system.
   (e)   Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analysis
involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of
a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended Solids (SS) analysis are obtained
from twenty-four hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pHs are determined
from periodic grab samples.

industrial concern in proportion to cost and consistent with the use charge
system.
   (a)   Each nonresidential user may be required to provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this
chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited material
shall be provided and maintained at the cost of the owner. Detailed plans
showing facilities and operating procedures to provide such protection shall be
submitted for review by Authority, and shall be approved by the Authority
before construction of the facility. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the nonresidential user from the
responsibility to modify the facility as necessary to meet the requirements
contained in this chapter.

   Within the districts established by this Zoning Code or amendments that may
later be adopted, there exists lots, uses of land, structures, and uses of
structures and land in combination which were lawful before this Zoning Code
was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted
under the terms of this Zoning Code, or future amendments. It is the intent of
this Zoning Code to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are
removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this
Zoning Code that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same district.
(Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89.)
1109.02 CONSTRUCTION BEGUN PRIOR TO ZONING EFFECTIVE DATE.
   Nothing in this Zoning Code shall be deemed to require a change in the
plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code and upon which actual building construction has
been carried on diligently, and completed within two (2) years of issuance of
zoning permit. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of
construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent
manner. Where demolition or removal of an existing building has been
substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall
be deemed to be actual construction, provided that the work shall be carried
out diligently. (Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89.)
1109.03 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-
family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single
lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning
Code notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Zoning
Code. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage
with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though
such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and
requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot
shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
Variances of other than lot area or width shall be obtained only through action
of the Planning Commission.
   If two or more lots or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or
amendment in this Zoning Code, and if all or part of the lots with no
buildings, do not meet the requirements established for lot width, and area,
the land involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the
purposes of this Zoning ode and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold
in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements
established by this Zoning Code, nor shall any division of any parcel be made
which creates a lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this
Zoning Code.
(Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89.)
1109.04 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   Where, at the time of adoption of this Zoning Code, lawful uses of land
exist which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Zoning
Code, the uses may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful,
provided:
   (a)   No such nonconforming uses shall be enlarged or increased, nor
extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code;
   (b)   No such nonconforming uses shall be moved in whole or part to any
portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such uses at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code;

for more than two (2) years, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to
the regulations specified by this Zoning Code for the district in which such
land is located; and
   (d)   No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this
Zoning Code shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land.
      (Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89.)
1109.05 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Code that could not be built under the terms of this
Zoning Code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its
location on the lot, bulk or other requirements concerning the structure, such
structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to
the following provisions:
   (a)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity;
   (b)   Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of
structure be destroyed by any means, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the provisions of this Code; and
   (c)   Should any structure be moved for any reason for any distance
whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located after it is moved. (Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89.)
1109.06 NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES OR OF STRUCTURES AND LAND IN
COMBINATION.
   If the lawful use involving individual structures or of a structure and land
in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this
Zoning Code, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this
Zoning Code, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful, subject to the following provisions:
   (a)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning
Code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing
the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is
located;
   (b)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, but no such use shall be extended to
occupy any land outside such building;
   (c)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structure and land, may, upon appeal to the Planning Commission,
be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Planning Commission
shall find that the proposed use is more appropriate to the district than the
existing nonconforming use, in that it is less conflicting with surrounding
land uses and comes closer to meeting the intent and purpose of the district in
which it is located, than the current nonconforming use. In permitting such
change, the Planning Commission may require appropriate conditions and
safeguards in accordance with other provisions of this Code.
   (d)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a
nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to
the regulations for the district and the nonconforming use may not thereafter
be resumed; and
   (e)   When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in
combination, is discontinued or abandoned for more than two (2) years, the
structure or structure and land in combination, shall not thereafter be used
except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
      (Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89.)
1109.07 REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.
   On any nonconforming structure, or portion of a structure containing a
nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, provided that
the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased.
Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of
such official.
(Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89.)
1109.08 NONCONFORMING CONDITIONAL USES.
   Uses listed in the District in which they are located as conditional uses
prior to enactment or amendment of this Zoning Code, shall be considered non-
conforming uses if they do not fully comply with the conditions for the
conditionally permitted uses established by this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89.)

known owners of property for which the use of land or structures does not
conform to the uses listed in the District in which it is located.
   No use of land, buildings or structures shall be made other than that
specified on the Certificate of Nonconforming Use unless it is for a conforming
use or the Planning Commission has approved a more conforming use as specified
in Section
1109.06(c) hereof.
   A copy of each Certificate of Nonconforming Use shall be retained by the
Zoning Inspector and one copy filed in the Fiscal Officer’s office.

(Ord. 2004-43. Passed 1-11-05.)
   (a)   Relationship to Adopted Plans and Policies.
      (1)   The site plan should reflect all Village plans and policies
affecting the site, including neighborhood plans, key area plans, master
concept plans, previously adopted planned unit residential, planned commercial
or industrial development plans.
      (2)   The site plan should be consistent with the statement of intent for
the zoning district in which it is located.
   (b)   Site Planning/Open Space.
      (1)   The natural topographic and landscape features of the site should
be incorporated into the development wherever possible.
      (2)   Buildings and open spaces should be in proportion and scale with
existing structures and spaces in the surrounding area.
      (3)   A site should not be so overcrowded as to cause unbalanced
relationships of buildings to open space. Open space areas should not be unduly
isolated from one another by unrelated physical obstructions such as buildings
and paved vehicular areas, but rather, should be linked by open space corridors
of reasonable width.
      (4)   When possible, natural separations should be created on the site by
careful planning of streets and clustering of buildings using natural land
features and open space for separation. Cul-de-sacs and loop streets, coupled
with open spaces, should be used to achieve separation and create identity for
sub-areas on the site.
   (c)   Building Design and Orientation.
      (1)   As dwelling unit intensities increase, greater opportunities for
privacy should be provided by utilizing fences or walls to enclose internal
views.
      (2)   The primary living area of a dwelling or the primary activity area
of a building should be oriented toward a natural site amenity where possible.
      (3)   Buildings should be sited in an orderly, non-random fashion.
Excessively long, unbroken building facades should be avoided.
      (4)   Consideration should be given in the siting of mid and high rise
buildings to the privacy of occupants of adjacent buildings.
   (d)   Stormwater Runoff. Stormwater runoff from the development should be
handled, as much as possible, through a natural system of roadside swales and
detention and retention facilities. These should be designed as an integral
part of the open space amenities or the parking and circulation system on the
site.
   (e)   Circulation.
      (1)   Street network. Short loop streets, cul-de-sacs and residential
streets should be used for access to low density residential land uses in order
to provide a safer living environment and a stronger sense of neighborhood
identity. Access to arterial streets should be limited, whenever possible, to
high density residential and non-residential land uses.
      (2)   Street alignment.
         A.   A combination tangent/curve street network should be used to
respect the existing natural features of a site, provide visual interest and
create a more practical alignment for efficient site planning of building
clusters.
         B.   Horizontal and vertical alignment of streets should be designed
to minimize grading quantities. This includes working with the existing grade
rather than against the grade to avoid excessive cut or fill. Particular effort
should be directed toward securing the flattest possible grade near
intersections.
      (3)   Pedestrian circulation.
         A.   Residential uses.
            1.   The complete separation of vehicular/pedestrian circulation
should be achieved whenever possible.
            2.   Walkways which provide access to parking, trash disposal
facilities, mailboxes, service areas and community facilities should be
approximately four (4) feet in width. Common area paths designed to carry
heavier pedestrian traffic should generally be five (5) to six (6) feet in
width in order to accommodate two (2) pedestrian lanes or one (1) pedestrian
lane and one (1) bicycle lane.
         B.   Nonresidential uses.
            1.   Off-street parking areas should be located within convenient
walking distance to the use being served.
            2.   Handicapped parking should be as near as possible to the
structure to avoid crossing parking aisleways.
            3.   Pedestrian and vehicular circulation should be separated as
much as possible, either through crosswalk/pavement markings, signalization or
complete grade separation.
         C.   Path and sidewalk crossings should be located where there is good
sight along the road. Ideally, street crossings should occur at intersections.
      (4)   Parking lots and garages.
         A.   When locating points of ingress and egress, consideration should
be given to the location of existing access points, adjacent to and directly
across the street from the site. Curb cuts should be shared by adjoining uses
whenever possible.
         B.   Parking areas should be screened and landscaped and traffic
islands should be provided to protect circulating vehicles and to break-up the
monotony of continuously paved areas.
         C.   Drive-through establishments, such as banks, should be located to
allow stacking space for peak hour operation and not restrict other parking lot
circulation.
         D.   Detached residential garages and carports should respect the
location of adjacent garages and driveways and should be architecturally
compatible with the principal structures on the site. When possible, garages
should be incorporated as a screening element in the overall site plan and used
to create private outdoor spaces and block objectionable views.
   (f)   Architectural Character.
      (1)   Continuity and compatibility.
         A.   New development and infill development should be viewed as part
of a cluster, block, neighborhood, or the entire community. Developments should
be designed with the idea of being architecturally compatible with nearby
structures or to screen incompatible elements of nearby development.
         B.   Within the standards for the applicable zoning district, the
height, scale and setback of each building should be compatible with existing
or proposed adjoining buildings. Architectural style should not necessarily
duplicate adjoining structures, but should be compatible in overall form,
texture, color and rhythm.   
      (2)   Architectural style.
         A.   The following is a checklist for evaluating architectural
character and compatibility. The following elements should be considered in
determining the architectural style or character of an area and whether a
proposed development is compatible with surrounding uses:
            1.   Form (building footprint) are the structures small or massive;
rectangular or linear; close together or far apart.
            2.   Height - are the buildings primarily horizontal or vertical.
            3.   Building materials - what are the predominant materials used;
are there several materials used or only one or two.
            4.   Colors - what are the predominant colors used on the
buildings; are many colors or only a few colors used.
            5.   Roof pitches - are the roofs sloped or flat; what specific
roof types are used.
            6.   Window and door details - what is the arrangement, proportion
and design details of windows and doors.
            7.   Complexity - are the building walls broken or unbroken; is the
overall design simple or ornate.
            8.   Paved areas and service areas - where is the location of
parking garages and service areas; what is the amount and location of paving on
the site; is the front yard paved; how do buildings relate to streets.
            9.   Landscaping - what is the amount, location and type of
landscaping and open space around the buildings and on the site.
            10.   Signs and street furniture - what types and number of signs
and street furniture are provided; where are they located in relationship to
structures.
         B.   Consistency in architectural style should be provided within a
development or an infill area.
         C.   The architectural style should be carried out in as authentic
manner as possible.
         D.   Variety can be provided within a particular architectural style
by subtly varying building form, setbacks, colors and materials.
   (g)   Signs.
      (1)   All signs, including wall, free-standing and window display should
be of a complimentary style and proportion in design and in visual relationship
to the site and its structures. Signs within a development should be compatible
with each other and signs should not compete for attention with signs on
adjoining premises.
      (2)   The colors, materials and lighting of every sign should be
restrained, and harmonious with the building site to which it relates. Signs
should define or enhance architectural elements of the building, not obscure or
destroy them.
      (3)   The number of graphic elements on each sign should be held to the
minimum legal needed to convey the sign’s major message and should reflect
simplicity, neatness and minimum wording, not only to avoid visual clutter, but
to improve legibility.
      (4)   Signage on each building should be consolidated and coordinated.
      (5)   Signs should identify the name and type of establishment and not
advertise products or brand names.
         (Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89.)
   (h)   Climatic Considerations/Energy Conservation.
      (Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89; Ord. 89-3. Passed 1-9-90.)
      (1)   Consideration should be given to both over and under-heated periods
of the year when determining building locations. Desirable slope exposure is
south-southeast.
      (2)   To maximize the effect of solar radiation in winter months and
maximize shade in the summer months:
         A.   Deciduous trees should be used for summer shade and winter
warmth;
         B.   Active living spaces should be oriented to the south for winter
warmth;
         C.   Building overhangs should be designed to shield the high summer
sun and expose the area to the lower winter sun.
      (3)   To reduce the impact of winter winds but maximize summer breezes:
         A.   Steeply pitched roofs should be used on the windward side to
deflect wind and reduce the roof area effected by the winds;
         B.   Blank walls, garages, or storage uses should be used on north
exposures;
         C.   North entrances should be protected with earth mounds, evergreens
and walls and fences; and
         D.   Natural ventilation with prevailing summer breezes should be
allowed for whenever possible.

1133.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to recognize and accommodate in a unified
development, creative and imaginative residential and/ancillary development and
to permit those innovations in the technology of land development that are in
the best interests of the Village; and to provide for a continuous residence in
the Village for the elderly who are able and who desire to remain in Hiram
Village. In order to accomplish this purpose, it is the intent in establishing
this section to achieve:
   (a)   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and living facilities, permitting an increased density per acre and
flexibility in yard and area requirements to allow for clustering of living
units;
   (b)   More functional patterns of open space and recreation areas;
   (c)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography
and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation, and prevents
the disruption of natural drainage patterns;
   (d)   A more efficient use of the land than is generally achieved through
conventional development resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utilities and streets; and
   (e)   A development pattern in harmony with land use density, transportation
facilities, and the community facilities objectives adopted by the Village.
   The Village is also prepared to accept a greater population density in
undeveloped areas than that reflected by present zoning provided that the
developer can demonstrate that any increment of public cost clearly
attributable to increase densities will be compensated for by the private
amenities and public benefits to be achieved by the plan of development.
(Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89.)
1133.02 SPECIAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   Because of the special characteristics of planned unit developments, special
provisions governing the development of land for this purpose are required.
Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this
chapter and those of other chapters in this Zoning Code, the provisions of this
chapter shall prevail. Subjects not covered by this chapter shall be governed
by the respective provisions found elsewhere in this Zoning Code. Except as
specifically noted, nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to exempt
PUD’s from all provisions of the Hiram Village Subdivision Regulations.
(Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89.)
1133.03 APPLICATION AND PROCEDURE.
   A PUD District shall be approved by the Planning Commission and the Village
Council. Upon approval, a Planned Unit Development District may be applied to
any existing residential district meeting the requirements, and for which PUD
approval has been granted. Upon approval of a final development plan, the
official zoning map shall be annotated for the land area involved so that the
district name includes the notation: “PUD”.
(Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89.)

pipelines or electric transmission lines) not owned by the developer of the
planned development.
         Smaller parcels may be considered on their basis to satisfy the
objectives of this chapter as stated in Section
1133.01.
      (2)   When the PUD proposes a mixture of residential uses with commercial
uses and/or institutional uses permitted by Section
1133.04(a)(2) and (3) respectively, the Planning Commission may limit the
development of such nonresidential uses to twenty percent (20%) or less of the

ponds, ravines and stream channels should be left in their natural state and
considered part of the required open space, subject to the above standards.
   (b)   Public open space which is to be developed as a major activity center
should be located on a thoroughfare designed to accommodate the resulting
traffic volumes.
   (c)   Disposition of Open Space. Prior to subdivision approval, the
developer of the PUD shall submit legal instruments which prescribe the manner
of plan of care and maintenance of common open spaces and recreation
facilities. Approval by the Planning Commission of such instruments shall be
based on the following standards:
      (1)   The instruments shall guarantee that open space as shown on the
final development plan will remain as such. The Planning Commission may require
that all development rights to the open space be deeded to the Village or such
other appropriate public body, or that permanent restrictive covenants be
attached to the open space.
      (2)   Such instruments shall convey to the Village and other appropriate
governmental bodies the right of entrance to the common open space and
recreation facilities for emergency purposes or in the event of nonperformance
of maintenance or improvement affecting the public interest. Such governments

maintenance functions with the costs levied against the property owner.
      (3)   Common open space and recreation facilities shall be deeded to a
homeowners association, funded community trust or similar entity. If a private
entity is to hold title to common open space, it shall not dispose of any
common open space or recreation facility without first offering to dedicate the
same to the Village. Membership in a homeowner’s association shall be mandatory
of all property owners within the PUD. Public utility and similar easements and
rights of way for water courses and other similar channels are not acceptable
for common open space dedication to the Village unless such land or right of
way is unusable as a trail or other similar purpose and approved by the
Planning Commission and Village Council. (Ord. 88-10. Passed 1-10-89.)

circulation pattern and the relationship of such land uses to the land use and
development patterns adjoining the PUD shall be evaluated.
   Commercial, institutional, and other nonresidential uses and buildings
(except industrial), when submitted to the Planning Commission, shall be
planned as groups having common parking areas and common ingress and egress
points to reduce the number of potential accident locations at intersections
and thoroughfares. Planting screens or fences shall be provided at the
perimeter of the commercial, institutional or nonresidential areas abutting

Regulations.
   (b)   Pre-Application Meeting. The developer shall meet with the Zoning
Inspector and the Planning Commission prior to the submission of the
preliminary development plan. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss early
and informally the purpose and effect of this Zoning Code and the criteria and
standards contained herein, and to familiarize the developer with the
comprehensive development plan, major thoroughfare plan, the parks and public
open space plan, the subdivision regulations, and the drainage, sewer, and
water systems of the Village, if such plans are in effect.
   The developer is also encouraged to meet with the Portage County Regional
Planning Commission to discuss the PUD plan.
   (c)   The developer shall follow the guidelines for application for site
plan review under Chapter
1111 and zoning permits.
   (d)   Criteria for Decision by the Planning Commission. Before making its
decision, the Planning Commission shall find that the facts submitted with the
application as presented that:
      (1)   The proposed development can be completed within five (5) years of
the date of approval;
      (2)   Each individual unit of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance
will be provided that such objective will be attained; the uses proposed will
not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will have a
beneficial effect which could not be achieved under standard district
regulations.
      (3)   The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to
carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic in
such amounts as to overload the street network outside the planned unit
development.
      (4)   Any proposed commercial development can be justified at the
locations proposed.
      (5)   Any exception from standard district requirements is warranted by
the design and other amenities incorporated in the development plan, in accord
with the planned unit development regulations and the adopted policies of the
Planning Commission and Village Council.
      (6)   The area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development;
      (7)   The planned unit development is in general conformance with the
comprehensive development plan of the Village and/or County.
      (8)   The existing and proposed utility services are adequate for the
population densities and nonresidential uses proposed.
   (e)   Supplementary Conditions and Safeguards. In approving any planned unit
development district, the Planning Commission may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Code. Violations of
such conditions or safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
development plan is approved, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Code,
and punishable under Section
1107.11  of this Zoning Code.
   (f)   Expiration and Extension of Approval Period. The approval of a
development plan for a Planned Unit Development District shall be for a period
not to exceed five (5) years to allow for preparation and recording of the
required subdivision plat and the development of the project. If no
construction has begun within five (5) years after approval is granted, the
approved final development plan shall be void and the land shall revert to the
district regulations in which it is located. An extension of the time limit or
modification of the approved development plan may be approved if the Planning
Commission finds that such extension or modification is not in conflict with
the public interest.
   No zoning amendment passed during the time period granted for the approved
final development plan shall in any way affect the terms under which approval
of the planned unit development was granted.

   (a)   The proposed use and development shall be reviewed to determine
whether or not the proposed use is appropriate and in keeping with the purpose
and intent of this Zoning Code and any adopted plans and policies in the
Village.
   A decision shall be made by the Planning Commission within ninety (90) days
of the date of receipt of the application, unless an extension of time is
necessary to secure technical advice or consider modifications as an
alternative to disapproval. The applicant shall concur with an agreed upon
extension date in writing.
   If the use and development proposed is found to be appropriate, and the
applicant shows that all conditions can be met, the Planning Commission with 3

Commission may require such additional information as they deem necessary
including carrying out of special studies and provision of expert advice, the
cost of which shall be borne by the applicant, who shall pay said costs prior
to issuance of any conditional zoning permit.
   (b)   Supplementary Conditions and Safeguards. In granting any conditional
use, the Planning Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and
safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Code. Violations of such conditions
and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the conditional use
is granted shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Code and punishable under
Sections
1107.10  and
1107.11 .
   (c)   The Planning Commission may hold a public hearing on any or every
application after advertising in a newspaper of general circulation in the
Village, at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing. The notice shall
indicate the place, date, time and subject of the hearing.

         (Ord. 97-34. Passed 2-10-98.)
   (y)   Wireless Telecommunication Towers. According to the Federal
Telecommunications Act, 1996, a community may regulate wireless
telecommunication service facilities, providing the requirements do not
prohibit nor have the effect of prohibiting wireless telecommunication
services. Zoning regulations may not unreasonably discriminate among wireless
telecommunication providers of functionally equivalent services. The Village
must act within a reasonable time period on requests for permission to place or
construct wireless telecommunication facilities. Denials for permission to
install or construct wireless telecommunication facilities must be in writing
and must be based on evidence in a written record before the Planning
Commission. If a wireless telecommunication facility meets technical standards
set by the FCC, it is presumed safe. The Village may not deny a request to
construct a facility on the grounds that the radio frequency emissions would be
harmful to the environment or health of the residents if those emissions meet
FCC standards.
      (1)   Purpose. These regulations are established to provide for the
construction and use of wireless telecommunication towers and facilities. The
purpose of these regulations is to balance the competing interests created by
the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, and the interests of the Village in
regulating wireless telecommunication facilities to minimize adverse health,
safety, public welfare, including visual impacts, through siting, design,
construction, buffering and reduction of the need for multiple tower locations.
      (2)   Priority of locations. A wireless telecommunication tower or
facility may be located in the following areas when conditions specified in
this Zoning Code are satisfied and efforts shall be made to locate in the areas
listed in the order of priority listed:
         A.   First Priority: New wireless antennas may colocate on existing
towers or on suitable existing structures.
         B.   Second Priority: A wireless telecommunication tower and/or
antenna facility shall be located in an Industrial Zoning District.
         C.   Priority for the use of Public Land for wireless
telecommunication antennas and towers will be given to the following entities
in order:
            1.   The Village of Hiram.
            2.   Public Safety Agencies/Departments including law enforcement,
fire and ambulance services.
            3.   Other governmental agencies for uses that are not related to
public safety.
            4.   Entities providing licensed commercial wireless
telecommunication services including cellular, PCS, SMR, ESMR, paging and
similar services that are marketed to the general public.
      (3)   General requirements.  
         A.   A proposed wireless telecommunication facility application shall
comply with site plan review requirements of this Zoning Code including
landscaping plans to screen the facility from adjoining uses.
         B.   All wireless telecommunication facilities shall be designed to
promote facility and site sharing.
         C.   All applications for wireless telecommunication facilities shall
as part of the application and site plan review process, include a plan for
reclamation for both the tower facility and tower site, in the event the
facility is no longer functioning in the fashion as originally intended. The
reclamation plan should include the removal and disposal of all obsolete and/or
abandoned equipment, as well as the reclamation of the area with vegetation to
prevent erosion.
         D.   The applicant will submit a letter of credit, performance bond,
or other security acceptable to the Village to cover the costs of the antenna
or tower’s removal, of no less than $100 per vertical foot of wireless
telecommunication tower height, measured from the finished grade. In addition,
any colocator shall be required to provide its own financial guarantee to the
Village to insure the removal and disposal of all obsolete and/or abandoned
equipment, and the reclamation of the tower site.
         E.   The application shall include conclusive technical evidence as to
why the wireless telecommunication tower and facility must be located where it
is proposed to be located and no alternative choice can be considered, in order
to service the applicant’s service area.
         F.   Existing towers must be utilized, as multi-user towers, if at all
possible, before a new tower may be constructed. The applicant must provide
written evidence that all wireless telecommunication service facilities that
supply service within the proposed service area have been requested to permit
co-location by the applicant and have been rejected by the owner of the tower,
building or structure. Facilities that are not proposed to be multi-user sites
must provide written explanation why the subject facility is not a candidate
for co- location.
         G.   As a condition of issuing a conditional zoning permit to
construct and operate a new tower in the Village, the owner/operator of the
telecommunication tower shall agree to allow co-location until the tower has
reached full antenna capacity, but in no event shall the owner/operator agree
to allow fewer than two additional antenna platforms for additional providers
unrelated to the owner/operator. Agreement to this provision must be included
in the applicant’s lease with the landowner if different from the owner/
operator of the tower. Written evidence shall be presented to the Planning
Commission that the owner of the property on which the tower is to be located
has agreed to the terms of this section as well as all other applicable
requirements in this Zoning Code.
      (4)   Standards applicable to all wireless telecommunication tower
facilities:
         A.   No tower shall be erected at a distance closer than the height of
the tower plus fifty (50) feet from any structure, road, highway, or property
line, excluding any building or road which is necessary to the express use of
the tower.
         B.   All towers shall be monopole structures.
         C.   An eight (8) foot high security fence shall be placed around the
tower base and all appurtenant structures within 20 feet of the tower base.
         D.   No tower shall exceed 200 feet in height and shall be the minimum
height necessary to accommodate the antenna.
         E.   All towers shall be painted a non-contrasting gray or similar
color, minimizing their visibility, unless otherwise required by the Federal
Communication Commission (FCC) or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
         F.   Except as required by law, an antenna or tower shall not be
illuminated and lighting fixtures or signs shall not be attached to the antenna
or tower. If lighting is required by the FAA regulations, white strobe lights
shall not be permitted at night unless FAA permits no other alternative. No
lighting shall be constructed, placed or maintained in a manner that will
constitute a nuisance and shall in no way impair safe movement of traffic on
any street or highway.
         G.   No advertising is permitted anywhere on the facility, with the
exception of identification signage.
         H.   The entire site must be appropriately landscaped to be harmonious
with surrounding properties and to minimize visual impacts.
            1.   Existing vegetation (trees and shrubs) shall be preserved to
the maximum extent possible.
            2.   Buffer plantings shall be located around the perimeter of
security fencing consisting of an evergreen screen, comprised of either a
hedge, planted 3 feet on center maximum, or a row of evergreen trees planted
five feet on center maximum.
         I.   All facilities shall be kept in an orderly and safe condition so
as to prevent injury to any single property, individual or Village in general.
         J.   Access drives to any facility shall be maintained in a dust free
condition.
         K.   Loud speakers shall not be permitted to be located on the

telephone number of who to contact in the event of an emergency.
         M.   The maximum size of the equipment shelter shall be 300 square
feet for a single user shelter, or if there is more than one, 750 total square
feet.
         N.   If an antenna for a wireless telecommunication facility is to be
attached to an existing structure or building the following conditions apply:
            1.   The maximum height shall be 20 feet or 20% of the building
height above the existing structure, whichever is greater.
            2.   If the applicant proposes to locate the telecommunications
equipment in a separate shelter (not located on, or attached to, the building)
the shelter shall comply with the following:
               a.   The minimum setback requirements for the subject zoning
district.
               b.   A buffer yard may be planted in accordance with subsection
(y)(4)H. hereof.
               c.   Vehicular access to the shelter shall not interfere with
the parking or vehicular circulation on the site for the principal use.
               d.   The maximum size of the equipment shelter shall not exceed
300 square feet, or if there is more than one user, 750 square feet.
         O.   Removal of Facilities: All towers, structures and equipment shall
be removed by the owner of the tower or facility, and the site restored to its
original state within 6 months following the date that the tower is no longer
operational. If more than one wireless communication service provider is using
the antenna support structure, the antenna support structure shall not be
considered abandoned until all such users cease using the structure for 6
months.
      (5)   Decision by the Planning Commission. Any decision to deny a request
to place, construct or modify a wireless telecommunication antenna or tower
shall be in writing and supported by evidence contained in a written record of
the proceedings of the Planning Commission.
         (Ord. 2004-38. Passed 11-9-04.)

1137.03 (c) hereof, shall first be submitted to the Zoning Inspector for
determination of compliance with Chapter
1137 . Application shall be submitted on forms made available by the Zoning
Inspector, and shall include the following:
      (1)   Evidence that the proposed amendment would materialize in an equal
or better Zoning Code than that existing.
      (2)   A statement of the proposed text change in the regulations set
forth in this Zoning Code.

to the particular property, and that it deprives the property owner of his
lawful and reasonable use of the land. For the purposes of this Zoning Code, a
limitation upon the financial gain from the land in question shall not
constitute unreasonable zoning.

directly across the street, and property within 500 feet from the parcel(s)
proposed to be rezoned as well as the addresses of those owners.

1143.01 OVERVIEW.
   (a)   Subdividing or platting is the usual means by which farm land or other
open land is converted into building sites. It consists of laying out such land
into streets and lots and the accompanying installation of the street and
sanitary improvements necessary to provide for traffic access and for water,
sewage disposal and other utility services. Subdividing is usually the first
step in the process of urbanization and urban expansion.
   (b)   Every real estate subdivision laid out becomes a permanent feature of
the area. The ground plans of communities and their environs, with few
exceptions, are simply a composite of plans of individual subdivisions. The
area concerned, on the other hand, acquires an addition whose character will
affect not only its future physical development but the cost of public
facilities and services. It is in recognition of this vital interest of the
community in subdividing and platting practices and standards, that most
states, by means of statutory provisions, have conferred upon local government
units the authority to control the subdividing of real estate.
   (c)   Subdivision control is the exercise by public authority of the right
to withhold the privilege of public record from subdivision plats which have
been poorly or inappropriately designed, or which are not properly adjusted to
the existing or potential development of adjoining areas or to an officially
adopted comprehensive plan.
   (d)   The statutes of the State of Ohio vest the control over subdivisions
within the Village when the Village has complied with certain requirements.
More specifically, the statutes (Section 711.09 of the Ohio Revised Code)
provide, in part, that:
"Whenever a Village Planning Commission or a Village Platting Commissioner, or,
if there is no Commission or Commissioner, the legislative authority of a
Village, adopts a plan for the major streets or thoroughfares and for the parks
and other public grounds of such Village or any part thereof, then no plat of a
subdivision of land within such Village shall be recorded until it has been
approved by the Village Commission, Commissioner, or legislative authority and
such approval endorsed in writing on the plat."
   (e)   In addition to adopting a plan of major streets or highways, the
Village Planning Commission, Platting Commissioner or legislative authority,
may adopt general rules governing plats and subdivision of land within its
jurisdiction in order to secure and provide for the coordination of streets
within the subdivision with existing streets and roads or with the plan or
plats of the municipal corporation, for the proper amount of open spaces for
traffic, circulation, and utilities, and for the avoidance of future congestion
of population detrimental to the public health or safety. These may include
regulations setting standards for, and requiring the actual construction of
streets, or other improvements or facilities, or assurance of such
construction, as a condition precedent to the approval of the plat of a
subdivision. However, any such regulations and requirements pertaining to
improvement installations must be adopted by the Village Council before they
may be made a part of the subdivision regulations of the Village Planning
Commission (Section 711.101 of the Ohio Revised Code). It is further required
by the statutes that the latter must be approved in its entirety by the Village
Council, after public hearing, before becoming effective. (Section 711.132 of
the Ohio Revised Code).
   (f)   Where subdivisions are not controlled or are inadequately controlled,
the consequences are many and varied. The layouts may show serious defects such
as inadequate or poorly designed street systems; lots of inappropriate size,
shape or orientation; or the street, sanitary or other utility improvements may
fall short of minimum standards necessary for health, safety or desirable
living conditions. Subdivisions may be further defective in relation to the
development of adjoining areas in that streets may be ill adapted to existing
or proposed streets in contiguous areas; the size and arrangement of lots may
not be in harmony with the existing or desirable future character of
development in a given area; the utilities may not be suitably coordinated in
point of location or size with those of adjoining areas. Finally, the layouts
of the subdivision may not be properly adjusted to, and may be in conflict
with, existing or proposed public facilities of neighborhood or area-wide
importance--e.g. a thoroughfare widening or extension, a school site, a
recreation area, a utility right-of-way.
   (g)   Subdivisions defective in one or several of the above particulars or
similar respects generally do not afford satisfactory living conditions for
their residents, besides hindering the orderly and sound development of the
area. In addition, they often occasion an undue burden by reason of the
excessively high cost of street or utility improvements or their maintenance,
unnecessarily high operating cost of public services, expensive corrective
improvements required in later years to remedy or lessen shortcomings due to
defective original layout or development.
   (h)   Broadly stated, the subdivision regulations are intended to serve as
an aid in preventing undesirable practices in land subdividing and as a tool to
be applied by the Village Planning Commission in the processing and reviewing
of plats for the purpose of promoting desirable modern concepts of subdivisions
with long-range plans for the Village's desirable future development.
   (i)   There are no guarantees, however, that all subdivisions complying with
them will be fully satisfactory or acceptable, as this will depend on the
competence of the designer in applying the principles and standards set forth
in the Regulations. Nevertheless, many defects in design will be prevented and
the quality of subdivisions generally improved.
   (j)   An important requirement stipulates that the subdivision be designed
so as to provide for all public facilities called for in the Comprehensive
Plan, which directly affect the tract to be platted. These may include highways
and thoroughfares, sites for schools, parks, playgrounds, and other public
facilities. The subdivision layout is required to conform further with the
provisions of the Zoning Code, as these will bear directly on the kind of
street layout, lot sizes, and other features of interior design appropriate for
the subdivision in a particular area.
   (k)   All existing or proposed highways and thoroughfares shown on the major
road plan as crossing or bordering a proposed subdivision are required to be
provided for in the general location and at the width designated. If a proposed
park, playground or school site, is proposed by the comprehensive plan, the
subdivider should be induced to dedicate such site, or at least reserve it, for
the indicated use, thereby affording the opportunity for the community to
acquire the needed land before it is improved.
   (l)   The requirement of the installation of street and sanitary
improvements prior to building construction is among the most important
provisions of the subdivision regulations. These installations are essential to
secure the health and safety of the future residents of the subdivision, as
well as the area as a whole and to combat excessive or premature subdividing
and land speculation and accompanying blight, depreciation of property value
and tax defaults, among others, which may result from such practices.

1143.04 PROCEDURES FOR SUBDIVISION APPROVAL.
   (a)   Approval Required. Whenever any subdivision of land is proposed (See
Section
1143.03 (b) "Subdivision Definitions"), before any deed of conveyance is made
for the sale of any part thereof, and before any permit for the erection of any
permanent building in such proposed subdivision shall be granted, the
subdivider or his agent shall apply for and secure approval of such proposed
subdivision in accordance with the following procedures.
   (b)   Conditional Use Standards for Platted Conventional Subdivisions.
      (1)   Design Criteria. Developer of any conventional subdivision must
demonstrate how a conventional subdivision layout better meets the purposes of
the zoning district in which the project is to be located than would a
conservation subdivision design.
         A.   Special natural resources and features, such as stands of trees,
open fields, ponds, streams, hills, and environmentally sensitive areas are
included and preserved in the overall design of the project.   
         B.   Historic and cultural features are included and preserved in the
   overall design of the project.
         C.   Buildings and roads are designed and located to protect and
enhance natural topography and the traditional rural Village character.

         A.   The proposed subdivision is located along an existing State,
County, or Village approved roadway and involves no opening, widening or
extension of any street or road or public utility;
         B.   In accordance with Section 711.131 of the Ohio Revised Code, no
more than five (5) lots may be transferred off the original tract.
         C.   The proposed subdivision is not contrary to applicable
subdivision, engineering, or zoning regulations;
         D.   The proposed subdivision is approved by the Village for
connection to an approved sanitary sewer system.
      (2)   Authority. Section 711.131 of the Ohio Revised Code gives Village

the following procedures.
      (3)   Application and Review Process.
         A.   Preliminary discussion phase. The subdivider is encouraged to
meet with the Zoning Inspector prior to developing any surveys or legal
descriptions affecting a minor subdivision or combination of land in order to
discuss the procedures involved and become familiar with any subdivision and
zoning regulations pertaining to the property and the proposed action. It is
helpful to provide a sketch plan showing approximations of the existing
property lines and proposed property lines. The sketch plan may be a rough
drawing and need not be detailed. It may also be helpful to meet with the
Zoning Inspector at the site of the proposed subdivision prior to developing
the minor subdivision plan.
         B.   Review and approval. Upon receipt of the "Application for a Lot
Split", the lot split plan and the required fee for a minor subdivision
approval, the Zoning Inspector shall forward the proposed subdivision plans to
those governmental and subdivision technical review agencies having
jurisdiction or interest in the proposed subdivision. If the staff is satisfied
that the proposed subdivision is not contrary to applicable platting, zoning
and subdivision
regulations, it shall, within seven (7) working days, approve such proposed
division. If the proposed subdivision does not meet the requirements of these
Regulations and applicable zoning regulations, the Zoning Inspector will not
approve the proposed minor subdivision. The burden shall be upon the subdivider
to amend the proposed subdivision to meet all applicable requirements.
         C.   Fees required. The Village Planning Commission, with the approval
of Village Council, shall establish fees to be deposited with each application.

points (not necessarily adjacent points) shall not exceed the reported distance
divided by five thousand (allowable linear error = reported distance divided by
five thousand) and every angular measurement shall be made in such a manner
that the allowable (directional) error, in radians, shall not exceed allowable
linear error divided by the reported distance [allowable (directional) error =
allowable linear error divided by the reported distance]. When the reported

preliminary plan was not filed with and approved by the Village Planning
Commission, the applicant for a major subdivision shall not construct any of
the necessary improvements until final plat approval has been obtained. The
final plat shall incorporate all changes in the preliminary plan required by
the Commission, otherwise it shall conform to the preliminary plan, and it may
constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plan which the
subdivider proposes to record and develop at the time.
If the subdivider of land did not submit the optional preliminary plan, all of
the information required in subsection (e) of these regulations shall be
submitted to the Village at the time the improvement plans for the proposed
subdivision are submitted. The final plat will be approved or disapproved and
shall conform with the requirements set forth in subsection (f)(3).
      (12)   Submission to State Highway Director. Before any plat is approved
affecting any land within three hundred (300) feet of the centerline of
proposed new highway(s) for which changes are proposed as described in the
certification to local officials by the State Highway Director of any land
within a radius of five hundred (500) feet from the point of intersection of
said centerline with any public road or highway, the Commission shall give
notice, by registered or certified mail to the Highway Director. The Commission
shall not approve the plat for one hundred twenty (120) days from the date the
notice is received by the Highway Director. If the Highway Director notifies
the Commission that he shall proceed to acquire the land needed, then the
Commission shall refuse to approve the plat. If the Highway Director notified
the Commission that acquisition at this time is not in the public interest or
upon the expiration of the one hundred twenty (120) day period or any extension
thereof agreed upon by the Highway Director and the property owner, the
Commission shall, if the plat is in conformance with all provisions of these
Regulations, approve the plat.

         (Ord. 99-15. Passed 9-14-99.)
1143.05 SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Subdivision Name.  The proposed subdivision name shall not duplicate
or closely approximate the name of any existing subdivision in the Village or
other locations within Portage County.
   (b)   Drainage.
      (1)   General. These drainage policies, guidelines and criteria do not
provide solutions to all drainage problems, and the Engineer is not exclusively
restricted to these designs and procedures. There may be special or unusual
drainage or design problems involving exceptions to these policies and
criteria. These special problems should be reviewed prior to completing final
plans.
      (2)   Commission Policy. The Commission shall not approve any subdivision
having inadequate storm drainage or any other physical wetness, drainage or
flooding impairment as determined by the Village or other member of the
Subdivision Technical Review Group.
      (3)   Stormwater Management Policy. For subdivision and development
proposals, the applicant shall submit all information necessary for the Village
to determine if the stormwater rate of runoff shall be controlled prior to
release to downstream properties. If the Village determines control of
stormwater runoff is necessary, the location, construction, ownership and
maintenance of required detention or retention facilities shall be resolved
prior to approval of the subdivision plat or proposed development.
   (c)   Master Drainage Plan.
      (1)   Requirements. Persons wishing to plat or develop property in the
Village of Hiram are required to prepare and submit a master drainage plan for
the total development area.
      (2)   Content. The applicant shall:
         A.   Prepare a topographic contour map with drainage areas delineated,
with a plan for draining the total upstream tributary watershed through the
proposed development,
         B.   Show the general layout of proposed inlets and storm sewers and
existing drainage structures with sizes and invert elevations,
         C.   Examine and show the routing path for excess runoff through the
site in the event the drainage facilities capacity is exceeded showing excess
stormwater will be kept out of habitable structures,
         D.   Submit the master drainage plan to the Village prior to
initiating final engineering plans.
      (3)   Preliminary Nature. It must be recognized the master drainage plan
is preliminary and does not constitute a detailed working design or plan from
which a sewer project can be constructed nor is such detail necessary to meet
the objectives of the preliminary phase.
   (d)   Final Drainage Plan. After approval of the master drainage plan, the
applicant shall provide a final drainage plan in accordance with these
Regulations.
      (1)   Methods for Determining Peak Rate and Design Flows.
         A.   Watersheds under 200 acres. It will be the policy of the Village
to use the Rational Method (Q=ciA) for all design storms for drainage areas of
200 acres or less.
         B.   Watersheds over 200 acres. For drainage areas over 200 acres and
for determining major storms, methods contained in ''Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds; Technical Release No. 55" may be used to provide peak rates of
runoff.
         C.   The Village may specify or approve other methods or techniques
for drainage calculations.
         D.   RUNOFF COEFFICIENT ("C" VALUE) GUIDELINES
            Unimproved Areas      0.2
            Parkland          0.2
            Cultivated         0.4 - 0.6

Guidelines.
      (2)   Design storms. The Major Storm will be based on a return period of
not less than 100 years, unless otherwise approved by the Village. Rainfall
frequency curves, as approved by the Village, may be used for all design
storms. The peak discharge to be computed for all storm drainage facilities is
defined in the design criteria for those facilities.
      (3)   Routing path. The overland routing path or major drainage system is
the part of the total storm drainage system which carries runoff exceeding
capacity of the initial system (storm sewers and open ditches). The major
drainage system shall have capacity, to carry runoff from the major storm
without causing significant threat to property or public safety.
      (4)   Design specifications: roadway culverts.
         A.   Culvert types and design standards shall meet the requirements of
the Village, ODOT and these guidelines.
         B.   Design storm frequency: 10-50 year as determined by the Village.

sewer when an area is developed. This policy will apply even when the
watercourse is located on a property line.
         B.   Ditch enclosures requiring a pipe diameter of 60' or greater for
a 2 year storm may receive consideration for exemption. Exemptions may be
granted as deemed appropriate by the Village.
         C.   Access to storm drainage ditches, channels and watercourses shall
be by means of maintenance easements. Such easements shall be not less than 20
feet in width on each side of the channel, plus the width of the channel
itself. Maintenance easements are to be kept free of obstructions.

         G.   Maximum Allowable Flow Velocity:
            Refer to subsection (f)(7) hereof.
Minimum Allowable Velocity: 2 fps based on 2-year storm (Channel paving may be
required to meet minimum flow velocity requirements).
      (8)   Detention and retention facilities. In developed and developing
urban and suburban areas, several means for controlling stormwater runoff are
available. This usually involves storing runoff on or below the ground surface.
The following types of storage facilities may be considered:
         A.   Parking Lot Storage. This is surface storage utilizing shallow
ponding in specifically graded areas of the parking lot. Controlled release
features are incorporated into the storm system. Inconvenience to users during
ponding, clogging of flow control devices and icy conditions during cold
weather are potential problems. Parking lot design and construction grades are
critical factors. This method is generally intended to control the runoff
directly from the parking area and is not usually appropriate for large
volumes.
         B.   Wet Ponds or Retention Basins. Storage capacity is available
above normal water level. Special outlet devices control release rates.
Potential problems include easements, safety and maintenance considerations.
Due to larger land area requirements and the need to maintain a permanent water
level, these facilities have broader applications for instream control
involving larger watersheds. However, recreational and aesthetic benefits are
often considerable.
         C.   Dry Basins or Detention Basins. These facilities are graded to
allow a temporary storage of water only. Outlet devices regulate discharge
rates and allow complete drainage of the facility when it is not raining. Dry
basins are widely used and often incorporate multi-use purposes such as open
space, playfields or parks.
         D.   Underground Tank Storage. Underground tanks or chambers may be
prefabricated or constructed on site. Storage volume is provided in large
diameter pipes, tanks, or chambers with outlet control devices. This method is
generally expensive but may be considered where land values are high and more
conventional basin designs would occupy too much land area. Storage trenches
and rock filled underground facilities are variations of tank storage as they
provide storage capacity in the void spaces between the rock materials. Low
storage volume and clogging problems may limit feasibility of this type of
facility.
         E.   Design Criteria: Detention/Retention Facilities:
            Design Frequency: 25-year storm--individual site
          development with 5 acres or less tributary area.
            100 year storm--watersheds over 5 acres.
             Release Rate: 2-year storm based on existing conditions, or
                   as otherwise approved by the Village.
            Overflow: Provide flood routing/overflow for discharges
               and volumes exceeding design capacity of
               system.
            Parking Lot Storage: 6-inch maximum depth of ponding.
            All Basins: Shall be located within easements and
             maintenance details resolved prior to approval.
            Wet Basins: Fencing may be required around wet basins.
            Dry Basins: Paved flow channels and/or underdrains may
             be required to provide complete drainage.
   (e)   Erosion and Sedimentation Control.
      (1)   When Required. An erosion and sedimentation control plan may be
required as a supplement to the street and drainage improvements plans. When
required, the plan must contain sediment pollution control practices so that
compliance with other provisions of these regulations and the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency's general permit for storm water discharges
associated with construction activity under the National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
An erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be required for any of the
following:
         A.   When a proposed development area consists of five (5) or more
acres and earth-disturbing activities are proposed for the whole area or any
part thereof, the responsible person shall develop and submit for approval a
sediment control plan prior to any earth-disturbing activity.
         B.   When a proposed development area involves less than five (5)
acres, it is not necessary to submit a sediment control plan; however, the
responsible person must comply with the other provisions of these Regulations.
All earth-disturbing activities may be subject to surveillance and site
investigation by the Portage County Soil and Water Conservation District
(PCSWCD) to determine compliance with these Regulations.
      (2)   Surety Required. A surety may be required for erosion and
sedimentation control improvements. The surety necessary to cover the erosion
and sedimentation control measures shall be included in the street and drainage
improvements surety.
      (3)   Coordination with Other Drainage Plans. Procedures for developing
erosion and sedimentation control plans shall be coordinated with other
provisions of these Regulations.
      (4)   Submission to Soil and Water Conversation District. Three (3)
copies of the erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be submitted to the
Village. The Portage County Soil and Water Conservation District shall review
and comment on the plans and may provide technical assistance to the developer,
Commission, and the Village's Office.
   (f)   Erosion Control Plan Requirements. The erosion and sedimentation
control plan shall be consistent with the street and drainage improvement
plans, and conform to the subdivision grading plan, the criteria of the Soil
Conservation Service Handbook, "Water Management and Sediment Control for
Urbanizing Areas", and shall include:
      (1)   Standards and Criteria.
         A.   The preliminary plan or final plat for the site on which the work
is to be performed;
         B.   Location of any buildings, structures, utilities, sewers, water
and storm drains on the site where the work is to be performed;

         E.   Detailed plans of all drainage provisions, retaining walls,
cribbing, vegetative practices, erosion and sediment control measures, location
of fences around sediment basins, steep excavations, or ponding areas, and
other protective devices to be constructed in connection with, or as a part of
the proposed work, together with a map showing the drainage area of land
tributary to the site, and estimated cubic foot per second runoff of the area
served by any drain, computed in accordance with current Village storm drainage
criteria;
         F.   A timing schedule and sequence indicating the anticipated
starting and completion dates of the development sequence; stripping and/or
clearing, rough grading and construction, final grading and vegetative
establishment, seeding mixture and rates for both temporary and permanent
seeding, lime and fertilizer application rates and kind and quantity of
mulching, maintenance, and the time of exposure of each area prior to the
completion of effective erosion and sediment control measures;
         G.   The engineer's estimated cost of the grading and/or filling and
the estimated cost of the required erosion controls.
      (2)   Sheet and Rill Erosion. To control pollution of public waters by
soil sediment from accelerated sheet and rill erosion on development areas, the
responsible person shall:
         A.   Construct and maintain sediment basins sized in accordance with
the United States Soil Conservation Service handbook, "Water Management and
Sediment Control for Urbanizing Areas"; or
         B.   Apply and maintain a level of management and conservation
practices such that the predicted average annual soil loss, accumulative
monthly in accordance with the procedure in the United States Soil Conservation
Service Handbook, "Water Management and Sediment Control for Urbanizing Areas",
is less than fifteen (15) tons per acre the first year commencing from the time
of initial earth disturbance, ten (10) tons per acre the second year and five
(5) tons per acre for any other year of the development process. The management
and conservation practices shall be designed, applied and maintained so that
the entire development area and any part thereof is protected from accelerated
erosion in accordance with the stated criteria; or,
         C.   Use other methods to control sediment pollution; this may
include, but is not limited to, a combination of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
standard, provided those methods are acceptable to the approving agency.
      (3)   Concentrated Water Erosion. To control pollution of public waters
by soil sediment from accelerated erosion in drainageways and grassed waterways
and in streams and ditches disturbed or modified in conjunction with the
development process on a development area, the responsible person shall:
         A.   Design, construct, and maintain concentrated water flow channels
such that the velocity of flow does not exceed the permissible velocities,
         B.   Design, construct, and maintain sediment basins sized in
accordance with the United States Soil Conservation Service Handbook, "Water
Management and Sediment Control for Urbanizing Areas"; or,
         C.   Use other methods to control sediment pollution; this may
include, but is not limited to, a combination of subsections (f)(3)A. and B.
hereof, provided those methods are acceptable to the approving agency.
      (4)   Sloughing, Landsliding and Dumping.  To control sediment pollution
of public waters caused by sloughing, landsliding, or dumping of earth
material, or placing of earth material into such proximity that it may readily
slough, slide, or erode into public waters by natural forces, no person shall:
         A.   Dump or place earth material into public waters or into such
proximity that it may readily slough, slide, or erode into public waters unless
such dumping or placing is authorized by the Village for purposes such as, but
not limited to, constructing bridges, culverts, erosion control structures and
other in-stream or channel bank improvement works; or,
         B.   Grade, excavate, fill, or impose a load upon any soil or slope
known to be prone to slipping or landsliding, thereby causing it to become
unstable, unless qualified engineering assistance has been employed to explore
the stability problems and make recommendations to correct, eliminate, or
adequately address the problems. Grading, excavating, filling, or construction
shall commence only after the Village has reviewed and approved the exploratory
work and recommendations and only in accordance with the approved
recommendations.
      (5)   Stream Channel and Floodplain Erosion. To control pollution of
public waters by soil sediment from accelerated stream channel erosion and to
control floodplain erosion caused by accelerated stormwater runoff from
development areas, increased peak rates and volumes of runoff shall be
controlled in conformance with the requirements of subsection (f)(7) hereof.
      (6)   Controlling Increases in Peaks and Volumes.  Methods for
controlling increases in stormwater runoff peaks and volumes may include but
are not limited to:
         A.   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for example,
grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical; (low
density development areas, access roads, etc.) discharging roof water to
vegetated areas; or grass and rock lined drainage channels;
         B.   Grading and construction of terraces and diversions to slow
runoff and use of grade control structures to provide a level of control in
flow paths and stream gradients;
         C.   Induced infiltration of increased stormwater runoff into the soil
where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas where
soils    are suitable; retaining topsoil for all areas to be revegetated; or
providing    good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities,
and;
         D.   Provisions for detention and/or retention; for example, permanent
ponds and lakes with stormwater basins provided with proper drainage, multiple
use areas for stormwater detention and recreation, wildlife, transportation,
fire protection, aesthetics, or subsurface storage areas.
      (7)   Permissible Velocities for Flowing Water.

      (8)   Permissible Velocities for Vegetated Stream Channels.
         A.   Drainage areas less than one (1) square mile. The maximum
permissible design velocity shall be based on site conditions and shall be such
as to result in stability of the ditch bottoms and side slopes. Maximum
permissible velocities will be computed using bank-full stage or 10-year
frequency stage, whichever is lower. The following table will be used as
maximum velocity for all drainage main or lateral designs. Vegetation shall be
established immediately after construction.

         B.   Drainage areas greater than one (1) square mile. Channel
velocities for newly constructed channels with drainage areas in excess of one
(1) square mile shall meet special stability requirements contained in U.S.
Soil Conservation Technical Guide, Technical Release #25, "Planning and Design
of Open Channels." Channels that cannot be designed to meet the maximum
velocity limitation must be stabilized with materials other than vegetation.
Such materials include crushed concrete, rip rap, gabions, etc.
   (g)   Subdivision Grading Plan.
      (1)   General. Proper grading of the subdivision is important to ensure a
safe building site and a usable yard area. Improper grading of a subdivision
can result in severe erosion and maintenance problems, or create a need for
costly corrective measures such as additional drainage facilities, retaining
walls, and the like. In some cases, improper grading can cause newly
constructed homes to be unsuitable for habitation. The subdivision grading plan
is general in nature, and is intended to serve as a guideline for establishing
lot grading and erosion control plans. It should allow for the independent
improvement of each lot.
      (2)   Plan Required. A subdivision grading plan shall be prepared for
every proposed subdivision.
      (3)   Submission Procedure. The subdivision grading plan shall be
submitted as a part of the final engineering and construction plans.
      (4)   Conformity with Master Drainage Plan. The subdivision grading plan
shall conform to the master drainage plan and other applicable drainage plans
and street improvements planned for the proposed subdivision.
   (h)   Subdivision Grading Plan Requirements. The subdivision grading plan
shall show:
      (1)   The approximate location of the proposed structure for each lot and
the type of block grading for each block in the proposed subdivision.
      (2)   The direction of flow, indicated by arrows.
      (3)   Proposed elevations shown by broken contour lines.
      (4)   Existing elevations shown by solid contour lines.
      (5)   Proposed drainage easements of the appropriate alignment and width
necessary for the expected use and maintenance of proposed drainage facilities.
   (i)   Individual Lot Grading Plan. An individual lot grading plan is
normally required by the Portage County Building Department when filing an
application for a building permit. In some cases, the Commission will require
that lot grading plans be submitted with the subdivision plan.
      (1)   Conformity with Master Drainage and Subdivision Grading Plan.
Individual lot grading plans shall conform to the Master Drainage Plan and
Subdivision Grading Plan.
      (2)   Individual Lot Grading Plan Requirements.
         A.   Individual lot grading plans shall conform to the requirements of
the U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Manual of Acceptable Practices,
1973.
         B.   The plan shall be drawn at a scale of not less than 1" = 20 feet,
unless otherwise allowed by the Chief Building Inspector.
         C.   In addition to the HUD requirements, the plan shall show:
            1.   Drainage easements on side and rear lot lines where necessary.
            2.   Existing topographical contours at 2' intervals. Sufficient
elevation shall be shown on the plan to indicate all proposed swale locations
and drainage directions, including all proposed surface grade breaks.
            3.   Spot elevations of the existing and finished grade where less
than a two percent (2%) slope exists, curb or edge of pavement elevations, and
proposed ground elevations at the right-of-way.
            4.   The proposed locations and dimensions of all buildings, paved
areas, wells, sewage disposal facilities, drainage tile, and other
improvements.
            5.   Side elevations of that portion of any structure which is
adjacent to the 100-year routing path, as shown on the Master Drainage Plan. No
basement entrances shall be permitted adjacent to the 100-year routing path.
The minimum building elevation for the lowest floor level (including basement)
when adjacent to the 100-year routing path shall be one (1) foot above the 100-
year flood elevation as shown on the Master Drainage Plan.
            6.   The direction of surface water flow along proposed swales.
            7.   The swales necessary to carry surface water away from the
building area, sanitary facilities and/or paved areas. All swale gradients must
be shown. All swales must have a gradient of one percent (1%) or greater,
unless otherwise allowed by the Chief Building Inspector.
   (j)   Common Access Driveways. Common access driveways to individual lots
will only be allowed in situations where due to unique physical, environmental,
historical, or traffic safety issues, the utilization of a standard roadway
would be detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the area. If
approved through the variance process by the Planning Commission, the common
access driveway may not serve more than three (3) lots.
   (k)   Streets.
      (1)   General.  All streets shall be considered in their relation to
existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, public convenience and
safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to
be served by such streets. All streets shall meet or exceed the requirements
established in these Regulations.
      (2)   Right-of-way Requirements. The arrangement, character, extent,
width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the Village
Thoroughfare Plan, or subsequent thereof, and the Comprehensive Plan, as
appropriate.
         A.   Right-of-way Dedication. When a subdivision abuts a public right-
of-way which is identified on the Village Thoroughfare Plan, additional right-
of-way for the street exceeding the existing right-of-way is required, the
subdivider shall dedicate to the    Village the additional right-of-way.
         B.   Collector, Local and Marginal Access Streets. For any subdivision
fronting along an existing Village, Township or County road not designated on
the Village Thoroughfare Plan, provisions shall be made to set aside the
necessary right-of-way for traffic, utilities, and drainage, in accordance with
the minimum right-of-way for local streets established by these Regulations.
      (3)   Lot Access and Frontage.
         A.   Lot Access on Major Arterials. The creation of lots which would
have direct access from a major arterial as identified in the Village Master
Plan or as identified by the criteria in these Regulations, shall be
discouraged.
         B.   Lots Abutting Arterials. Where a proposed subdivision abuts or
contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the Commission may require:
            1.   Marginal access streets.
            2.   Reverse frontage lots with depth adequate to insulate the
building area from the arterial.
            3.   Buffering and screening provisions as addressed in subsection
(m)(2) hereof, or such other treatment as may be necessary for the separation
of through traffic from the activities of the proposed building areas.
            4.   Driveways with turn-arounds.
         C.   Grassed Area. A grassed area having a minimum width of twenty
(20) feet shall be provided between the pavement of the arterial street and the
pavement of the marginal access street. The minimum width of the marginal
access right-of-way shall be fifty (50) feet.
         D.   Subdivision Abutting Physical Barriers. Where a proposed
subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the
Commission may require:
            1.   Frontage roads or street approximately parallel to and on each
side of such barrier, or
            2.   The placement of higher intensity non-residential uses or open
space adjacent to such right-of-way in order to buffer residential uses,
            3.   Landscaping and buffering provisions as addressed in
subsection (m)(2) hereof.
      (4)   Street Classification. Each street in a subdivision shall be
classified and designed in accordance with the following tables:

(e) Collector-arterial                                   1320 feet
Maximum degree of curvature                              20 degrees
 
      (5)   Minor Street Design. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their
use by through traffic will be discouraged. The Commission may require that the
subdivider alter the street layout in order to discourage its use by through
traffic.
      (6)   Provision for Future Subdivisions. Where the plat submitted
includes only part of the tract owned or intended for development by the
subdivider, a plan showing the future street system and general lot layout for
the unsubdivided portion shall be prepared and submitted by the developer.
      (7)   Special Street Types. Street layouts providing adequate access,
traffic flow and circulation patterns are important to fire, safety, road
maintenance and snow removal forces and equipment. Also impacted by street
layout are consumer services involving moving or delivery vans, refuse
collection vehicles, and construction equipment or building supply and material
delivery vehicles.
Alternate access routes for each lot is the ideal goal from a public health,
safety and welfare, as well as convenience, point of view. With these factors
in mind, the policy of the Commission is to encourage sound design practices
and principles avoiding extensive or complex dead end street systems and/or
excessive cul-de-sac lengths.
         A.   Dead-end Street Systems, Cul-de-sacs, Stub Streets. Permanent
dead-end streets without an approved cul-de-sac or other approved permanent
turn-around facility shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-end stub streets
shall be permitted only as part of an approved continuing street plan.
Temporary turn-around provisions and cul-de-sac bulbs shall have a minimum
paved diameter of 80'. The Village and Fire Chief may require a greater paved
diameter.      
Many factors are involved in determining the maximum allowable length for a
cul-de-sac or dead end street system. Such considerations as the total number
of lots, size of lots, type of street section (side ditch or curbed usable
pavement), right-of-way width, street gradients, size of turn-around,
availability of water lines and fire hydrants, availability of sanitary sewers,
etc., influence this issue of public health, safety and welfare concerning
density of development and alternate access routes for fire and safety forces
and equipment as well as snow fighting and street maintenance forces and
equipment.
If allowed, a cul-de-sac or dead end street system shall not exceed nine
hundred (900) feet in length.
In multi-phase subdivisions, short stub streets to facilitate future street
extensions and connection of street systems may be considered, and if allowed,
shall meet the following conditions:
            1.   Length of a stub street shall not extend more than two lots
past the intersection,
            2.   Stub streets shall be allowed only if the potential future
extension of the stub street is identified and its connection to an existing or
planned street is shown on a proposed sketch plan, and is deemed feasible and
practical by the Commission,
            3.   The plat shall contain the following note: Stub streets shall
be extended and opened as public streets in subsequent phases of development or
permanent cul-de-sac turnarounds shall be installed, and
            4.   A financial surety is provided in sufficient amount to
guarantee the installation of the permanent cul-de-sac turnaround in the event
such street is not extended in future phases of development.
         B.   Half Streets. Dedication of new half-streets shall not be
permitted. Where a dedicated or platted half-street exists adjacent to the
tract being subdivided, the other half shall be platted and constructed
according to the provisions of these Regulations.
         C.   Service Roads or Alleys. As a general rule, alleys or service
roads will not be approved in residential subdivisions unless specifically
included in a planned development. Alleys may be required in commercial and
industrial districts if other provisions cannot be made for adequate service
access. Service roads for access to public utility facilities are exempted from
these Regulations.
      (8)   Curb and Gutter. Mountable curb or standard curb and gutter street
sections shall be required in all subdivisions having a density of two (2)
dwelling units per acre or more. The Commission may waive this requirement.
      (9)   Street Names. The names of proposed streets in the subdivision
shall not duplicate or closely resemble the names of existing streets in the
Village or Portage County. New streets which are extensions of or in alignment
with existing streets shall bear the name of the existing streets.
Confirm at the earliest date possible the use of proposed street names with the
Village and the County Engineer's Office. It shall be the responsibility of the
Village's Office to assure correct street names. All new streets shall be named
in the following manner:
 
DIRECTION   OVER 1000 FEET LESS THAN 1000
            LONG           FEET LONG
North/South Street         Place
East/West   Avenue         Court
Diagonal    Road           Way
Curving     Drive          Circle
 
      (10)   Required Shared Driveways. The Planning Commission may require a
subdivider to create a shared common access driveway or common access point for
multiple driveways due to the terrain, traffic conditions, the need to limit
curb cuts, line of sight, or other site conditions.
      (11)   Sidewalks. The Commission may require sidewalks in residential
subdivisions where the predominant lot width is under one hundred (100) feet or
less. Sidewalks shall be required on both sides of each street when the average
lot width is sixty (60) feet or less. Public sidewalks may be required for
commercial or industrial lots, as may be deemed necessary by the Commission.
Sidewalks shall be composed of Portland Cement Concrete with a minimum width of
four (4) feet and shall conform to Item 608 of the current "Construction and
Material Specifications", State of Ohio, Department of Highways Manual.
Sidewalks will not be required on any open ditch section.
      (12)   Pavement Specifications. Pavement shall meet or exceed the
following criteria:

All items shall meet current Ohio Department of Transportation's "Construction
and Materials Specifications" manual.
      (13)   Private Streets. There shall be no private streets, lanes or ways,
nor any private easement of access used for the purpose of access to any
subdivision including subdivisions exempt from platting under Ohio Revised Code
Section 711.131 and these regulations, unless said private streets, lanes, ways
or easement of access is constructed and maintained to Village road
specifications and standards. The cost of maintenance of said private streets,
lanes, ways or easements of access shall be borne equitably by benefiting
property owners. Proper legal steps shall be taken to guarantee the continuing
maintenance of any private street, lane, way or easement that may be permitted.
Public easements of access, lanes or ways leading to public facilities such as
pump stations, stand pipes and the like are exempted from these Regulations.
      (14)   Blocks. The following regulations shall govern the design and
layout of blocks:
         A.   The arrangements of blocks shall be such as to conform to the
street planning criteria set forth in subsection (k) hereof and shall be
arranged to accommodate lots and building sites of the size and character
required for the district as set forth in these Regulations or the Zoning Code,
and to provide for the required community facilities.
         B.   Irregularly shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sacs or loop
streets, and those containing interior parks or playgrounds, may be approved by
the Commission if properly designed and located and if the maintenance of
interior public spaces is covered by agreements.
         C.   No block shall be longer than fifteen hundred (1,500) feet and
the block width shall accommodate two (2) tiers of lots, except where unusual
topography or other exceptional physical circumstances exist.
         D.   Where blocks are over nine hundred (900) feet in length, a
crosswalk easement no less than ten (10) feet in width at or near the halfway
point may be required to provide proper access to schools, recreational areas,
shopping centers, and other facilities.
         E.   For slope areas where the average topographic slope is fifteen
percent (15%) or greater, refer to Hillside Regulations, subsection (b) hereof.
      (15)   Lots. The following Regulations shall govern the design and layout
of lots:
         A.   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory building sites, properly related to the topography and the
character of surrounding development. All lots shall be numbered consecutively
within a block.
         B.   All lots shall conform to or exceed the requirements of these
Regulations and the zoning district requirements for the district in which they
are located.
         C.   Each lot shall front on an approved thoroughfare unless otherwise
allowed by the Commission. For slope areas where the average topographic slope
is fifteen percent (15%) or greater, refer to the Hillside Regulations,
subsection (b) hereof.
         D.   All side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines and
radial to curved street lines, except where the Commission determines that a
variation to this rule would provide a better layout. The Commission may grant
variation to this specific rule independent of normal subdivision variance
procedures.
         E.   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots shall be required where
they are essential to provide separation of residential, commercial or
industrial development from traffic arteries. A buffer of at least twenty (20)
feet, across which there would be no rights of vehicular access, shall be
provided along the lot lines abutting such traffic arteries.
         F.   No corner lot shall have a width at the front minimum building
setback line of less than seventy-five (75) feet.
      G.   No lot shall have an average depth which is more than three and one
half (3-1/2) times its width as measured along the front minimum building
setback line unless otherwise allowed by the Commission.
         H.   Lots for residence purpose shall be at least sixty (60) feet wide
at all points between the front and rear minimum building set-back lines, in
order to permit compliance with the side yard requirements of the Zoning Code;
except, in areas zoned for Planned Unit Developments (PUD) for the purpose of
constructing common-wall, cluster or patio single family structures or
variations thereof, wherein the lot width, depth, set-back, side yard, rear
yard distances shall be governed by the Zoning Regulations that are applicable.
         I.   For each reserve established within a subdivision, there will be
wording on the plat indicating what the intended future use of the reserve
shall be.
         
   (l)   Easements.
      (1)   Utilities. Easements of at least ten (10) feet in total width,
along rear or side lot lines shall be provided where necessary for sanitary
sewer, storm sewers, water lines, gas mains, electric lines, telephone and
telecommunications facilities.
      (2)   Watercourse Easement. When deemed necessary by the Village,
easements shall be provided along every watercourse, drainage channel, stream,
or other environmentally sensitive area.
      (3)   Utility Placement.  All proposed utilities within the boundaries of
the subdivision shall be placed underground unless otherwise allowed by the
Commission.
   (m)   Screening and Buffering Provisions.
      (1)   When Required. When screening and buffering provisions are required
by the Zoning Code, the screening and buffering provisions shall be shown as a
part of the preliminary plan if a preliminary plan is submitted. In the event a
preliminary plan is not submitted, a landscaping plan shall be submitted with
the final plat.
The Commission may require screening and buffering provisions for any lot
abutting a thoroughfare, a limited access highway, a railroad, or other major
physical barrier or significant noise source.
No screening and buffering provisions shall be permitted in any State,    
County, Village or Township right-of-way unless otherwise allowed by the entity
having jurisdiction over any such right-of-way.
      (2)   Types of Screening and Buffering. The subdivider may utilize walls,
fences, mounding, landscaping, trees, or any combination thereof to accomplish
the required screening and buffering, provided that it meets with the following
criteria:
         A.   If screening is to be accomplished by use of vegetation, the
vegetation should be sufficient to achieve the required standards within a
reasonable period of time.
         B.   If screening is to be accomplished using mounding, mounds
generally should not exceed a three (3) foot horizontal to one (1) foot
vertical slope ratio. Steeper slopes may be allowed if justified by the
screening plan. The mounds shall be seeded upon completion and all applicable
erosion control practices, as determined by the PSWCD shall be utilized. All
mounding and landscaping shall permit accomplishment of proper lot drainage.
   Vehicular sight distance shall not be impaired by any screening or buffering
provisions.
   (n)   Planned Unit Development and Conservation Subdivisions.
      (1)   Use. The planned unit development and conservation development
approach as set forth in the Village Zoning Code are encouraged by the
Commission.
      (2)   Coordination of Flexible Zoning Application with Subdivision
Approval. It is the intent of these Regulations that subdivision review be
carried out simultaneously with the review of flexible zoning applications
under the Zoning Code. The plans required for flexible zoning application shall
be submitted in a form to satisfy the requirements of the Subdivision
         Regulations.
      (3)   Flexibility of Standards and Requirements. Where deemed necessary
by the Commission, the design standards and improvements specifications of
these Regulations may be altered to allow for flexibility for subdivisions in
areas zoned for planned development and conservation development, providing
such alterations are in keeping with the spirit and intent of these Regulations
and providing such alterations meet the requirements of the zoning code as may
be amended.
If sufficient detail is provided during rezoning, and Village approvals are
obtained, a subdivision variance will not be required.
   (o)   Provisions for Alternative Energy Systems.
      (1)   Policy. The Commission and the Village encourage the use of
alternative energy sources, such as solar, geothermal and wind energy. It is
Commission's policy to make subdivision design standards flexible where
necessary to make the use of alternative energy systems feasible.
      (2)   Variances. The Commission may vary subdivision design standards
necessary to accommodate alternative forms of energy without requiring a formal
variance application, provided that the proposal meets with all applicable
zoning requirements and provided that the subdivider supply sufficient written
intentions to the effect that alternative energy systems will be utilized as
proposed.
      (3)   Maximization of Opportunities. Street and lot layouts in all
subdivision proposals should reflect an attempt to maximize opportunities to
utilize alternative forms of energy. Due consideration should be given to
southern exposures and south facing slopes.
   
   (p)   Trees. Trees shall be planted outside of the street right-of-way or
any sewer or water easements that may be adjacent to the street right-of-way
and planted in such manner as not to impair visibility at any corner or
corners. It is strongly recommended that all subdividers or developers retain
existing trees on each lot. The Commission may require that certain trees and/
or species remain unharmed. The Commission will cooperate in giving advice on
species of trees which are acceptable for plantings.
   When forested or wooded areas are developed, special consideration and
provisions should be made in order to maximize the economic and aesthetic value
of the trees and avoid creating maintenance liabilities for future homeowners.
Trees which have grown in a forested or wooded environment, especially large
mature trees, are often highly susceptible to stress factors such as soil
compaction, changes in grade elevation, wind throw and sunburn. These stress
factors are generally created by development activities but can be minimized
with proper construction and urban forestry management techniques.
(Ord. 99-15. Passed 9-14-99.)
1143.06 LAND SUITABILITY.
   Land which the Commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or
development due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, geologic
conditions, soil conditions, water quality or quantity, utility easements, or
other features which will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health and
general welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or
its surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless methods
adequate to resolve the problems are formulated by the developer and approved
by the Commission, upon the recommendations of the pertinent Technical Review
Agency(s).
   (a)   Watercourses.
      (1)   Natural Drainageways.  The subdivider shall make all provisions
necessary to assure that all natural watercourses and drainageways, wet
streams, creeks, ditches or swales, continue to function in their natural
manner. When ever changes are contemplated for any of the above watercourses,
plans for such changes shall be submitted to and approved by the Village, Army
Corps of Engineers or any other authority that may have jurisdiction.
      (2)   Easements Required. Where deemed necessary by the Village, a
watercourse easement shall be provided according to the specifications of the
Village.
   (b)   Hillside Regulations.
      (1)   Cuts and Fills. No land should be graded, cut or filled so as to
create a slope exceeding a vertical rise of one (1) foot for each two and one
half (2-1/2) feet of horizontal distance between abutting lots, unless a
retaining wall of sufficient height, thickness and design is provided to retain
the graded bank, or other acceptable control measures are provided.
   Major cuts, excavation, grading, and filling where the same materially
changes the site and its relationship with surrounding areas or materially
affects such areas, shall not be permitted if such excavation, grading, and
filling will result in a slope exceeding a vertical rise of one (1) foot for
each two and one half (2-1/2) feet of horizontal distance between abutting lots
or between adjoining tracts of land, except where adequate provisions are made
to prevent slides and erosion by cribbing and retaining walls or other
acceptable measures.
      (2)   Compaction of Fill. All fill shall be compacted to a density of
ninety percent (90%) or greater.
      (3)   Retaining Walls. Retaining walls may be required whenever
topographic conditions warrant or where necessary to retain fill or cut slopes
within the right-of-way. Such improvements shall require the approval of the
Village and shall be designed by a licensed professional engineer.
      (4)   Driveways. The maximum grade on driveways shall not exceed ten
(10%) percent for residential drives and eight (8%) percent for commercial and
industrial drives. (Ord. 99-15. Passed 9-14-99.)
1143.07 DEDICATION OF PARKS OR OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   Statement of Policy. With respect to residential subdivisions and
developments to which these Regulations apply, developers or subdividers may be
required to dedicate lands for parks, playgrounds, or as open space or deposit
monies with the Village in lieu of dedication of lands.
   (b)   Open Space.  In the interest of public welfare, at least ten percent
(10%) of the area of every subdivision, exclusive of road rights of way, shall
be set aside as open space for recreational purposes. Such land set aside shall
be suitable for use as parks or playgrounds. Such land shall be dedicated for
public use, or reserved for the common use of all property owners or tenants
within the proposed subdivision.
   (c)   Dedication to the Public. If the area set aside is dedicated for
public use, it shall be dedicated to and accepted by the Village. If the
Village refuses to accept any such dedication, then such areas shall either be
reserved for the common use of all property owners or tenants of the proposed
subdivision or a payment in lieu of land dedication shall be made to the
Village for capital improvements to existing public open spaces, parks or
playgrounds.
   (d)   Reservation for Common Use. Reservation of open space for common use
may be accomplished by conveyance of such area to a property owners'
association or the developer may employ any other legal device by which such
area is effectively reserved for the common use of all property owners, such as
a land trust. Any such legal device shall provide where such area is reserved
for the common use of all property owners within the subdivision, covenants
that run with the land shall be endorsed on the plat and inserted in the deed
to every purchaser of property within the subdivision requiring each property
owner to pay a proportionate share of the maintenance cost of such open space.
   (e)   Payment In Lieu of Dedication or Reservation. If the area proposed for
development does not include a site identified by the Land Use and Thoroughfare
Plan as public open space and if the Village refuses to accept the dedication
of land to the public, the developer may make a cash payment to the Village in
lieu of setting aside the required open space. The amount of the payment in
lieu of dedication or reservation shall be based on the appraised value of the
land that otherwise would normally be required to be dedicated or reserved for
open space by these Regulations.
   The appraisal shall reflect the after improvement value of a typical lot
within the proposed subdivision and shall be expressed in dollars per square
foot. Once the average value per square foot of land has been determined, it
shall then be multiplied by the total square footage of land that otherwise
would be required to be dedicated or reserved as open space. The amount that is
determined by this calculation shall be the amount of the payment in lieu of
dedication or reservation.
   (f)   Preservation of Natural Features. Due consideration shall be given by
the developer and the Planning Commission to preserving outstanding natural
features such as scenic spots, water bodies or exceptionally fine stands of
trees.
(Ord. 99-15. Passed 9-14-99.)
1143.08 SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENTS.

final plat, the subdivider of the land covered by the said plat shall pay all
applicable fees and execute and submit to Village Council three (3) signed
copies of a subdivider's agreement which shall be binding on his or her heirs,
personal representatives and assigns, a part of which agreement shall be set
forth that unless otherwise allowed by the Village, no building shall be
occupied or receive a certification of occupancy until all improvements
required under these Regulations have been made in the manner prescribed by
these Regulations.
   (b)   Methods for the Installation of Improvements. Prior to the recording
of the final plat, the subdivider shall, pursuant to Section 711.101 of the
Ohio Revised Code, install or provide for the installation of improvements by
one (1) of the two (2) following options:
      (1)   Option A.  
         A.   If the subdivider has submitted and obtained preliminary plan
approval from the Commission, and the improvement plans have been submitted and
approved and prior to the submission, approval and signature of the final plat
by Village Council, the subdivider may opt to complete all the required
improvements and provide for the maintenance and/or dedication of these
improvements, free and clear of all encumbrances on the property, or the
subdivider may opt to provide a surety to the Village guaranteeing the
installation of any required improvements so that the final plat may be
submitted for review prior to the completion of improvements. The amount of
surety to be provided shall be in an amount equal to one-hundred twenty-five
percent (125%) of the approved engineer's cost estimate for the construction,
installation, and inspection of any and all improvements associated with the
proposed subdivision.
   B.   Such surety shall comply with all statutory requirements and shall be
satisfactory to the Village in form, content and manner of execution. The
Village Solicitor shall approve all such sureties as to their form and manner
of execution.
         C.   If such surety is provided to the satisfaction of the Village,
the subdivider may submit the final plat for review and approval prior to the
completion of the necessary improvements. Once the plat has been approved, it
may be recorded.
      (2)   Option B.
         A.   If the subdivider has not submitted the optional preliminary plan
but has filed improvement plans with the Village and has received improvement
plan approval, the applicant, prior to the submission or approval of the final
plat, shall provide a surety to the Village guaranteeing the installation of
any required improvements. The amount of surety to be provided shall be in an
amount equal to one-hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the approved
engineer's cost estimate for the construction, installation, and inspection of
any and all improvements associated with the proposed subdivision.
         B.   Such surety shall comply with all statutory requirements and
shall be satisfactory to the Village in form, content and manner of execution.
The Village Solicitor shall approve all such sureties as to their form and
manner of execution.
         C.   If such surety is provided to the satisfaction of the Village,
the subdivider may submit the final plat for review and approval prior to the
completion of the necessary improvements. Once the plat has been approved, it
may be recorded.
   (c)   Completion Period.  If a surety has been provided, all required
improvements must be completed within two years of the date of final plat
approval.
   (d)   Surety Reduction.  The surety may be reduced from time to time by the
cost of construction completed and approved, as determined by the Village. The
Engineer, in addition to the actual work completed, may consider paid invoices
for materials that have been installed as well as any other information the
subdivider may wish to provide to assist in the determination of a fair and
reasonable surety reduction amount.
   (e)   Subdivision Plat Vacation. At anytime after providing a surety and
recording of a subdivision plat and prior to the transfer of any land in the
subdivision, a subdivision plat may be vacated in its entirety, upon the mutual
agreement of the subdivider and the Village. Said surety may be released in its
entirety after said subdivision plat vacation is completed in accordance with
Chapter 711 and other applicable statutes of the Ohio Revised Code. All plat
vacations shall be subject to the procedure and requirements for filing a final
plat. Preliminary plan requirements shall be excluded for plat vacations.
   (f)   Hold Harmless. The subdivider shall hold the Village free and harmless
from any and all claims for damages of every nature arising or growing out of
the construction of such improvements, and shall defend, at his/her own cost
and expense, each and every lawsuit brought against said Village by reason
thereof until the improvement has been accepted by the Village and Village
Council.
   (g)   Maintenance. The subdivider shall maintain all improvements in the
subdivision or proposed subdivision and provide for snow removal in the same
until Village Council has granted final acceptance of the improvements. The
Village, where appropriate, shall require the subdivider to submit a warranty/
maintenance surety in an amount not exceeding three percent (3%) of the
original cost of the improvements which shall be in force for no more than one
(1) year following the final acceptance of any required improvements and shall
guarantee satisfactory performance of the said improvements.
   (h)   Conditions.    All of the required street and drainage improvements to
be installed under the provisions of these Regulations shall be subject to the
inspection of the Village. All of the Village's expenses incurred as a result
of the improvements shall be paid either directly, indirectly or by
reimbursement to the Village by the subdivider.
   No final plat shall be signed by Village Council until Council has received
reports signed by the Village certifying that all required improvements have
been installed as stipulated under these Regulations and meet the requirements
of the Village.
   (i)   Procedure for Street and Drainage Improvements.  
      (1)   All typical sections and major engineering details or drainage
systems to be used on any particular street must receive approval by the
Village prior to completion of the construction improvement plans. The
subdivider's representative is encouraged to meet with the Village to discuss
details in the process of forming the construction plans.
      (2)   The subdivider shall submit two sets of prints together with
drainage calculations, maps delineating areas tributary to the proposed storm
system, and any existing facilities within and adjacent to the proposed site
   to the Village for review. These prints shall be in accordance with street
and drainage requirements put forth in these Regulations. Within thirty (30)
days, the Village shall review the prints and inform the subdivider of changes
necessary in the improvement plans if there are any. Upon receipt of the
Village review comments, the subdivider shall submit revised plans as per the
Village recommendation along with a title sheet for signing by the Village. The
Village shall make a determination within fifteen (15) days regarding the
revised improvement plans. If required changes have been made as stipulated by
the review comments, the aforementioned signatures shall be affixed to the
revised plans and title sheet. If the subdivider opts to install improvements
prior to final plat approval,    he shall complete the required improvements
within two years of the date    of improvement plan approval.
      (3)   If the subdivider opts to execute a surety, they shall do so in
accordance with the provisions of these Regulations and shall complete said
improvements within two (2) years from the date on which the surety    is
executed and approved by the Village. No construction is to occur prior to
improvement plan approval
      (4)   Upon approval of the improvement plans, the subdivider shall
deposit with the Village two percent (2%) of the estimated construction costs
to initially cover the cost of inspecting said improvements. If more funds are
needed to cover the costs of inspection, they will be requested by letter which
shall show how inspection time has been used to date. All monies deposited for
inspection of improvements that is not used shall be returned to the
subdivider. All inspection time and services will be charged at a rate current
with the cost of personnel and equipment used.
      (5)   The subdivider shall notify the Village of each construction phase
requiring inspection as determined by the Village's requirements, at least two
(2) working days prior to when the inspection is needed.   
      (6)   The subdivider shall notify the Village when, in the subdivider's
opinion, all of the required improvements have been installed. The Village
shall conduct a final inspection of the improvements within two (2) weeks after
receiving this notice from the subdivider. If the work is found to be
satisfactory and all inspection fees have been paid, the Village shall
recommend final acceptance of the improvements to Village Council. Failure to
reject any defective work or material shall not in any way prevent later
rejection when such defects are discovered, or obligate the Village to accept
defective improvements.
      (7)   Certified "as built" drawings shall be supplied to the Village
prior to final acceptance of the improvements. No improvements may be installed
except as provided for in the approved improvement plans or as may be later
approved by the Village in writing. The "as built" drawings shall include
locations (both vertical and horizontal), dimensions and material
specifications for all required improvements.
   (j)   Boundary and Subdivision Surveys.

road intersection.
         D.   The surveyor shall research at the Zoning Inspector's Office and
County Engineer's Office for existing road plans and monumentation prior to
commencing the survey.
         E.   If a Village survey control monument is available within one (1)
mile of the proposed subdivision, all associated surveys are required to tie
into the existing monumentation. If Village monumentation does not exist and a
County survey control monument is available within one (1) mile, then the
survey is to be tied to the County monumentation.
      (2)   Monumentation.
         A.   All monuments shall meet the "Minimum Standards for Boundary
Surveys in the State of Ohio."
         B.   All monuments shall be set by or under the direct supervision of
a registered professional surveyor. Said surveyor shall certify to the Village
in writing that all required monumentation has been set prior to final approval
and acceptance of the improvements or the release of the surety guaranteeing
the installation of the improvements.
         C.   A minimum of four (4) permanent monuments shall be set to control
the subdivision plat. Additional monuments shall be set to properly control the
original survey and any interior streets being platted as may be required by
   the Village or these Regulations.
         D.   All permanent monuments to be set shall be indicated on he final
subdivision plat. For street alignment control, the surveyor shall set
permanent monuments in the centerlines of intersecting streets and in the
centerline of a street at the point it changes direction (PC, PI and PT).   
         E.   The final subdivision plat shall delineate between survey
monuments found or set, and identify the type of each monument.
   (k)   Improvement Plan Requirements.
      (1)   General.
         A.   All improvement plans shall be prepared, signed and sealed by a
registered professional engineer. Plans shall include title sheet, index map at
1" = 200' scale, location map, typical sections, plan and profile view, bench

material.
         D.   All lettering and drawings shall be made with black India ink.
All signatures shall be made with black, non-smearing ink.
      (3)   Conformance of Construction to Plan.  All items of work covered and
stipulated in the construction plans, including altering or any extra work
shall be performed in accordance with the lines, grades, typical cross sections
and dimensions shown on the construction plans. All streets shall be graded the
full width of the right-of-way with all trees within the right-of-way removed.
The setting and marking of all line, profile and grade stakes necessary for the
layout of the work in accordance with the construction plans will be performed
under the supervision of a registered engineer or registered surveyor. Should
any misunderstanding arise as to the intent or meaning of the construction
plans, or any discrepancy appear in same, or in, the proper method of setting
and marking of the construction stakes, the decision of the Village in such
cases shall be final.
      (4)   Plan and Profile Views. The plan view shall be drawn to a scale of
1" = 50'. Other scales will be used only with the approval of the Village or
his representative in advance of the plan preparation. The plan view shall show
the proposed road, street or alley alignment, right-of-way and pavement widths,
centerlines, bearings, stationing, curve or radius data, existing and proposed
drainage. Pavement details for cul-de-sacs, the turnarounds or other pertinent
data shall be drawn    to a scale of 1" = 20'. Any other significant feature or
factor, shall also be shown on the plans. The centerline of road, street or
alley construction shall coincide with the     centerline of the right-of-way.
Any proposed or existing utilities          within the road right-of-way, and a
points of crossing storm sewers, shall be shown in the plan and profile views.
Any changes from the same shall be at the discretion of the Village or his
representative. The profile view shall have a horizontal scale of 1" = 50'. The
vertical scale shall be 1" = 5'. The existing and proposed centerline profile,
elevations, gradient, existing and proposed drainage lines and vertical curves
shall be shown. Future profile grades shall be established a sufficient
distance beyond the development to eliminate abrupt grade changes. If portions
of the work fall outside the corporate limits of the Village or abut a Township
or County road, plans shall be submitted to the Portage County Regional
Planning Commission for their review.
      (5)   Typical Sections. The typical sections shall meet the current
requirements as set forth by the Village.
      (6)   Street Plans. Refer to Sections
1143.05 (k)(12) and
1143.05 (k)(11) for street pavement and sidewalk specifications.
         A.   Curb and Gutter. Curb, or mountable curb and gutter, may be
required as part of any road or street construction if, in the opinion of the
Village, such type of construction is deemed desirable. Mountable curb may only
be used on local streets, frontage roads, service roads, loop roads and cul-de-
sacs. When an uncurbed section is used, storm pipe may be required under both
side ditches. When the driveway is constructed, an inlet shall be placed on the
upstream side of the driveway, unless otherwise allowed by the Village.
         B.   Driveways. The maximum grade on driveways shall not exceed
fourteen percent (14%). Driveway pipe shall be reinforced concrete pipe or
equal with a    minimum diameter of twelve inches (12"). On a normal ditch
section, pipe shall extend a minimum of five (5) feet on each side of the
driveway. Variations in ditch geometry may require additional length.
         C.   Vertical Curves. Vertical curves shall be used in local or
collector streets at all points on the gradient where the algebraic difference
is one percent (1%) or greater. Vertical curves shall be used at all change in
gradients for arterial or industrial streets. The minimum length of any
vertical curve shall be one hundred (100) feet.
         D.   Construction of Additional Streets and Roads. Where deemed
necessary or desirable, the Village or his representative may require
construction of part or all of any intersection, road, street, or alley in
order to assure no hardships or added expense be endured by abutting property
owners, the Village, Township or County on some future date. (Ord. 99-15.
Passed 9-14-99.)
1143.09 SEWAGE DISPOSAL AND WATER SUPPLY POLICIES.
   (a)   Wastewater Disposal Policies.
      (1)   Where a public central sanitary sewer system (See Section
1143.03 (b)) is reasonably accessible, and capacity is determined to exist, the
subdivider shall connect to it and provide sewage collection facilities for
each lot in the proposed subdivision. The determination of whether or not
capacity exists or can be readily constructed, shall be made by the Village. If
a central sanitary sewer system is available, the Commission will disapprove a
subdivision if individual wastewater treatment systems are proposed.
   Where a public sanitary sewer system is not reasonably accessible, but may
become available within a reasonable time (not to exceed twenty (20) years, as
shown in the wastewater facilities plan for the area), easements for central
sewer shall be provided on the subdivision plat. Where wastewater facilities
planning has not been completed, sanitary sewer easements may be required along
major drainage courses or right-of-way on the recommendation of the Village.
      (2)   Where public central sanitary sewers are not reasonably accessible
and are not planned or anticipated for a period in excess of ten (10) years,
the subdivider may be required to install a package treatment plant and
collection system in accordance with these Regulations and the Regulations of
the Village and the Ohio E.P.A. The plant shall be located to facilitate future
connection with public sanitary facilities or the extension of future
collection sewers to the treatment facility. Packaged wastewater treatment
systems shall be required when the number of subdivided parcels is twenty (20)
or more.
      (3)   Packaged wastewater treatment systems may be required on subdivided
parcels of less than twenty (20) units if determined cost effective by the
Village.
      (4)   If a public sanitary sewer is accessible and a sanitary sewer is
placed in a street or alley abutting upon the property, the owner thereof shall
be required to connect to the said sewer for the purpose of disposing of waste,
and it shall be unlawful for any such owner or occupant to maintain upon any
such property an individual sewage disposal system.
   (b)   Water Supply Policies.
      (1)   Where a public central water system (See Section
1143.03 (b)) is determined to be reasonably accessible, the subdivider shall
connect to it and provide water mains accessible to each lot in the proposed
subdivision. The determination of whether or not the central system is
reasonably accessible shall be made by the Village.
      (2)   Where a public central water system is not reasonably accessible,

1143.11 VARIANCES AND REVISIONS.
   (a)   General.  Where the Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or
practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these Regulations
and/or the purpose of these Regulations may be served to a greater extent by an
alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these Subdivision regulations
so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured,
provided that such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent
and purpose of these Regulations; and further provided the Commission shall not
approve variances unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence

this section.
   (b)   Residential Density Standards. Each residential lot shall be of a size
and shape to provide a building lot which shall be in harmony with the natural
terrain and other features of the land. Residential lots shall be designed in
such a way as to promote the purposes of this chapter.
   (c)   Common Open Space Requirements.
      (1)   All land not devoted to dwellings, individual building lots,
accessory uses, and roads shall be set aside as common land for recreation,
conservation, or agricultural uses which preserve the land in essentially its
natural condition.
      (2)   The total area of land designated as permanent, common open space,
not to be further subdivided, shall comprise at least thirty (30) percent of
the net site acreage in the R-2 District, at least forty (40) percent of the
net site acreage in the R-1 District and at least fifty (50) percent of the net
site acreage in the O-C District, excluding land required for street rights-of-
way and lands identified as wetlands. Common open space shall not include any
portions of individual building lots.
      (3)   Design of common open space areas shall be governed by the
following standards:
         A.   These common open space areas shall include, to the extent
possible, a combination of the most sensitive and noteworthy natural, scenic
and cultural resources on the site, consisting of features such as:
            1.   Scenic views, especially those from existing affronting and
abutting public roadways.
            2.   Prime farmland.
            3.   Mature woodlands.
            4.   Aquifer recharge areas.
            5.   Highly permeable soils.
            6.   Wildlife habitat areas.
            7.   Historic, archaeological or cultural features.
         B.   Significant natural amenities, such as outcroppings, tree stands,
ponds, ravines and stream channels should be left in their natural state and
considered part of the required common open space, subject to the standards of
this section.
         C.   Permanent bodies of water, as well as any area within a
designated flood hazard area should comprise no more than fifty (50) percent of
the required common open space. This percentage may be increased at the
discretion of the Planning Commission depending on the water body's utility as
a recreation or open space asset to the Conservation Subdivision.
         D.   Structures or buildings accessory to recreation, conservation or
agricultural uses may be erected as long as the total paved and roofed areas do
not exceed five (5) percent of the total common open land.
         E.   Stormwater management ponds or basins may be included as part of
the minimum required open space, as may land within rights-of-way for
underground pipelines.
      (4)   An open space buffer shall be preserved on existing roads fronting
and abutting the parcels to be developed. The buffer area shall be between a
minimum of 50 feet and a maximum of 100 feet in depth back from the edge of the
road right-of-way, based on the size of the project area. The larger the
project area, the greater the required buffer area. Parcels with unobstructed
views to the roadway and no natural existing features, such as trees or hills
alongside the roadways may be required to have a deeper buffer zone in order to
minimize the perceived density of the building lots.
      (5)   All individual building lots shall be set back from the boundaries
of adjacent properties by an open space buffer area equal, in width, to the
front yard setback of the underlying district. The buffer shall include trees
and shall be kept in a natural landscaped condition.
   (d)   Roads. All roads shall be designed and constructed in accordance with
Village road standards, except the Planning Commission may approve reductions
in the required right-of-way width where deemed practical, in consultation with
the Village.
(Ord. 99-15. Passed 9-14-99.)
1145.04 SUBDIVISION DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   The following guidelines apply to Conservation Subdivision developments with
regard to the layout of building lots and open space. The Planning Commission
will utilize the following guidelines in evaluating design appropriate to the
site's natural, historic and cultural features. Diversity and creativity in
site design and lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible
relationship between development and open space areas.
   (a)   Natural Features Preservation:
      (1)   Protect and preserve all floodplains, wetlands and steep slopes
from clearing, grading, filling or construction.
      (2)   Preserve and maintain mature woodlands, existing fields, pastures,
meadows, and orchards and create sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts
between residential and agricultural users.
      (3)   Design around and preserve sites of historic, archaeological or
cultural value, as needed to safeguard the character of the feature.
      (4)   Protect wildlife habitat areas or species listed as endangered,
threatened, or of special concern by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Natural Area and Preserves.
   (b)   Agricultural Land and Woodlands:
      (1)   If building lots must be located on open fields or pastures because
of greater constraints in all other parts of the site, they should be located
on the least prime agricultural soils, or in locations at the far edge of the
fields, as seen from existing public roads.
      (2)   Design around existing hedgerows and tree lines between fields and
meadows. Minimize impacts on woodlands (greater than five acres), especially
those containing many mature trees or significant wildlife habitat. Also
woodlands on highly erodible soils with slopes greater than ten (10) percent
should be preserved.
   (c)   Dwelling Placement and Buffering:
      (1)   Development should be designed so that it will be visually buffered
from existing public roads by a planting screen consisting of a variety of
trees, shrubs and wildflowers.
      (2)   Leave scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted,
particularly as seen from existing public roadways.
      (3)   Development should be designed so that, as much as feasible,
building lot rear boundary lines do not abut one another. View of open space
from each building site should be preserved as much as feasible.
      (4)   Avoid siting new construction on prominent open hilltops or ridges,
by taking advantage of lower or shielded areas on the site.
   (d)   Access to Open Space. Common open space shall be directly accessible
to the largest practicable number of lots. The majority of building lots should
abut undivided open space in order to provide direct views and access.
   (e)   Configuration of Open Space.
      (1)   Provide open space that is reasonably contiguous. Fragmentation of
open space should be minimized so that these areas are not divided into
numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development.
      (2)   Open space shall be located so as to conform with and extend
existing and potential open space areas on adjacent developments.
   (f)   Streets and Roads.
      (1)   Single-loaded residential access streets are preferred in order
that the maximum number of homes in open space developments may enjoy views of
common open space. Where foreground meadows are created between existing public
roadways and such single-loaded residential access streets, residences shall be
located on the far side of the access streets as seen from the public roadways
and shall front on the access streets and towards the public roadways.
      (2)   The road design should incorporate commons or ovals rather than
cul-de-sacs as much as possible. Street connections shall generally be
encouraged to minimize the number of new cul-de-sacs to be maintained by the
Village and to facilitate easy access to and from homes in different parts of
the property and on adjoining parcels. Where cul-de-sacs are necessary, those
serving six or fewer homes may be designed with "hammerheads" facilitating
three-point turns. Those serving more than six homes shall generally be
designed with a central island containing trees and shrubs (either conserved on
site or planted).
      (3)   Vehicular and pedestrian circulation system shall be designed to
insure safe, efficient movement through the open space subdivision development
and into surrounding highway systems. Design of circulation systems shall be
governed by the following standards:
         A.   Safe and easy access by emergency vehicles shall be provided for
all areas of the subdivision.
         B.   Direct access from single family residential lots to arterial or
collector thoroughfares shall be minimized.
         C.   Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to permit
smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimal hazards to
vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Minor streets within the subdivision shall be
designed to discourage through traffic.
         D.   The pedestrian and bicycle system and their related walkways
shall be insulated as much as possible from vehicular movement.
   (g)   Landscaping.  Landscape common areas, such as community greens, ovals,
and cul-de-sac islands, and both sides of new streets with shade trees.
   (h)   Utilities.  All utilities in the open space subdivision development
shall be located underground.
   (i)   Stormwater Management. Grading and surface drainage provisions shall
be designed to minimize adverse effects on abutting parcels, streams and public
streets, and to minimize the possibility of erosion.
      (Ord. 99-15. Passed 9-14-99.)
1145.05 COMMON OPEN SPACE STANDARDS.
   (a)   Use of Common Open Space.
      (1)   Permitted Uses: Subject to other relevant provisions of this
chapter, the following uses and improvements shall be permitted on common open
space lands: agricultural, horticulture, silviculture, nurseries, aquaculture,
passive recreation (including, but not limited to, walking, hiking, horseback

gun ranges) and other uses similar in character and potential impact. Also
included as permitted uses are water wells, septic disposal facilities, and
storm water retention areas designed, landscaped and available for use as an
integral part of the common open space.
      (2)   Conditional Uses: Uses and improvements on common open space lands
requiring a Conditional Use Permit shall include those designed for active
recreation such as playgrounds, playing fields or courts for organized sports,
swimming pools, picnic areas, bikeways, and any buildings, structures,
supporting facilities, driveways, or parking areas proposed in relation to the
foregoing. Application for conditional use permits shall be made by the owner
of the common open space.
   Further subdivision of common open space lands or its use for other than
those uses listed above, except for easements for underground utilities, shall
be prohibited.
   (b)   Preservation of Common Open Space. Prior to subdivision approval, the
developer of the Conservation Subdivision shall submit legal instruments which
prescribe the manner and plan for care and maintenance of common open spaces.
      (1)   Common open space shall be set aside by the developer through
irrevocable conveyances acceptable to the Planning Commission. Forms of
dedication for common open space shall include at least two (2) vehicles such
as:
         A.   A recorded deed restriction, and
         B.   A permanent conservation easement to the Village, another public
agency or a charitable organization, such as a land trust, as defined by the
Ohio Revised Code, or
         C.   Other agreement in a form acceptable to the Village Solicitor.
      (2)   Such conveyances shall assure that the common open space, as shown
on the final development plan will remain as such and will be only used as
permitted in subsection (a) hereof.
      (3)   A plan for the disposition, use, maintenance and insurance of the
common open space, including provisions for funding shall be provided and
approved by the Village Solicitor prior to plat approval.
         (Ord. 99-15. Passed 9-14-99.)
1145.06 OWNERSHIP AND MAINTENANCE OF COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   Ownership. Common open space within a development shall be owned,
administered and maintained by any of the following methods, either
individually or in combination, subject to the approval of the Village.
      (1)   Fee Simple Dedication to a Public Agency. The Village, or other
public agency acceptable to the Village, may, but shall not be required to,
accept any portion of the common facilities.
      (2)   Homeowners' Association. The open space may be held in common
ownership by a Homeowners' Association, which shall be formed and operated
under the following provisions:
         A.   The developer shall provide a description of the association to
the Planning Commission including its bylaws and methods for maintaining the
common open space.
         B.   The association shall be organized by the developer and be
operated with financial subsidization by the developer, before the sale of any
lots within the development.
         C.   Membership in the association is automatic (mandatory) for all
purchasers of lots therein and their successors. Membership shares shall be
defined within the association bylaws. The conditions and timing of
transferring control of the association from the developer to lot owners shall
be identified.
         D.   The association shall be responsible for payment of all costs of
maintaining such common open space, as well as insurance and taxes, enforceable
by liens placed by the Village on the association. The Homeowners Association
shall be authorized under its bylaws to place liens on the property of owners
who fall delinquent in payment of such dues or assessments.
      (3)   Condominiums. The common open space may be controlled through the
use of condominium agreements, approved by the Village. Such agreements will be
in conformance with the state's Condominium Property law (ORC 5311).
      (4)   Dedication of Easements to a Public Agency. The Village, or other
public agency acceptable to the Village, may, but shall not be required to,
accept easements for public use of any portion of the common facilities, title
of which is to remain in private ownership.
      (5)   Transfer of Fee Simple Ownership or Easements to a Private
Conservation Organization. Any owner may dedicate fee simple ownership or
transfer easements on any portion of the common open space to a private, non-
profit conservation organization.
   (b)   Maintenance Standards for Common Open Space.
      (1)   The ultimate owner of the common open space shall be responsible
for raising all monies required for maintenance, operations and improvements to
the common open space. Common open space accepted by the Village and dedicated
for public use as a park shall be maintained by the Village.
      (2)   Failure to adequately maintain the common open space in reasonable
order and condition constitutes a violation of this chapter.
      (3)   In the event the owner fails to maintain the common open space in
reasonable order and condition, in accordance with the approved open space
development plan, or the common open space is determined by the Village to be a
public nuisance, the Village Zoning Inspector will serve written notice upon
the owner, setting forth the manner in which said owner has failed to maintain
the common open space in reasonable condition and directing the owner to remedy
same within thirty (30) days.
      (4)   Failure to achieve such remedy within the specified time shall be
cause for maintenance to be undertaken by the Village with the assessment of
cost upon the owner.
         (Ord. 99-15. Passed 9-14-99.)
1145.07 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION.
   (a)   General Procedure. In general, the procedure for approval requires
site plan review and approval, and approval of the development plan. The plan
for streets and improvements must comply with the Village of Hiram Subdivision
Regulations.
   (b)   Pre-Application Meeting. The developer shall meet with the Zoning
Inspector and the Planning Commission prior to the submission of the

1301.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective January 1, 2016, as amended to
date, and as identified and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official
finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions
of this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved
by the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code
shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

summons in a civil case or by certified mail addressed to the owner of record
of the premises at his or her last known address or to the address to which tax
bills are sent, or by a combination of the foregoing methods, to abate such
abandoned conditions within thirty (30) days either by placing the structure in
operation in accordance with this section, by adapting and using the structure
for another use permitted in the zoning district, or by razing the structure,

depressions to the grade level of the lot, provided, however, that if the
structure is used after the notice is given and remains in operation for ninety
consecutive days, the provisions of this section shall not apply.
   (c)   Upon the failure, neglect or refusal of any owner to comply with the
notice to abate such abandonment, the Zoning Inspector shall advise the Village
Solicitor of all the facts and the Village Solicitor shall proceed to exercise

   (a)   No person, firm or corporation shall wreck or demolish any building or
structure, or move the same, without first obtaining a permit therefor from the
Village Administrator. The permit to move any building or structure may be
refused if, in the judgment of the Village Administrator, the building cannot
be moved without causing substantial damage to property or it is structurally
unsafe or unfit for the purpose for which it is to be moved. The movement of
any building or structure upon a City street or highway shall also require a
permit issued by the Chief of Police, which shall provide for a determination

(Ord. 2005-17. Passed 9-13-05.)
1321.02 CASH DEPOSIT REQUIRED.
   Before a permit to move or wreck a building is issued, the owner or
applicant shall deposit with the Fiscal Officer a sum of money as set forth in
Section
1321.09 and
1321.10 to indemnify the Village against any claim or damage to Village
property, to reimburse the Village for any expense incurred in connection with

chapter are complied with. In the event any claim of damage to Village property
or any expense is incurred by the Village in connection with such moving or
wrecking, the Village shall be authorized to reimburse itself out of such cash
deposit. Furthermore, if the owner or applicant fails to perform the duties and
obligations of this Regulation within the time and in the manner prescribed
herein, the Village may proceed to complete the work and charge the cost
thereof to the cash deposit. After all work is completed in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter and after deducting any expenses incurred by the
Village or any claims allowed by the Village, any moneys remaining shall be
refunded to the party making the deposit.

1321.04 REMOVAL OF SERVICE CONNECTIONS AND FOUNDATION MATERIAL; FILLING OF
EXCAVATIONS AND DITCHES.
   (a)   Sanitary sewer service lines, storm sewer service lines, water service
lines, and gas service lines shall all be disconnected at the main line. This
is required to prevent future leaks and to reduce the possibility of damage to
the utility during subsequent street excavations. Sanitary sewer laterals shall
be capped or plugged where the connection to the sewer is a fabricated wye or
tee. When the connection is a tap into the main sewer, a band shall be
installed around the pipe to provide a water tight seal. The ends of a pipe
abandoned in place shall be capped or plugged water tight. Storm sewer laterals
shall be removed and capped or banded in the same manner as the sanitary
laterals. Water service lines shall have the corporation stop removed from the
main line and it shall be replaced with a threaded plug. When it is found that
the trench in which said service lines have been laid has resulted in
settlement of the area above the trench, the area affected by this settlement
shall be excavated and a full depth repair of the affected area including
pavement, sidewalk and curb replacement, as may be necessary, shall be
performed.
   (b)   The owner of the premises being moved or wrecked shall have the option
of causing the above mentioned sanitary sewer or water service line
disconnected work to be performed by a contractor of his/her choice or to make
a payment in lieu of disconnection to the Village at the time the demolition or
moving permit is obtained. The payment in lieu of disconnection shall be $2,500
per required sanitary sewer disconnection and $1,500 per required water
disconnection and is payable in cash or by a certified cashier’s check, and
shall be paid through the Service Director office. This payment will be used to
offset the Village’s cost in contracting the completion of this work.
      (1)   When the payment in lieu of disconnection option is selected, the
sewer service lines shall have a 45-degree elbow installed on the property end
of the line as near as possible to the back of curb or back of sidewalk.
Immediately after the 45-degree elbow, sufficient pipe shall be installed to
bring this extension of the sewer line to one foot above grade. At this point,
a cleanout with a water tight plug shall be installed so that the location of
the sewer service line is accessible and readily identifiable.
Those portions of the pipe and cleanout above grade shall be adequately
protected during backfilling and site restoration operations to guard against
breakage. The water service line, when this option is selected, shall be shut
off at the curb box and the house side end of the line shall be crimped or
capped in a manner which provides a water tight plug. The stub end of the
service line shall be the location of the shut-off box and shall be clearly
identified that it may readily be located in the future.
      (2)   Where, in the opinion of the Village Administrator, the sanitary
sewer and waterline laterals are found to be in a condition equal to that
required of new construction, he or she may allow them to remain providing
there is reasonable cause to believe they will be used to serve a new
structure.
         (Ord. 2005-17. Passed 9-13-05.)
1321.05 PUBLIC PROTECTION; BARRICADES.
   When wrecking buildings adjacent to public sidewalks, streets, or alleys, a
fence at least eight feet high must be erected around the site to protect the
public from falling materials, cave- ins, and other hazards, and adequate
precautions shall be taken to protect buildings, public walks and streets
adjacent thereto from damage. When wrecking buildings which are not adjacent to
sidewalks, streets, or alleys, an open fence or barricade clearly defining the
site shall be erected and maintained, and adequate precaution shall be taken to
protect the public from falling materials, excavations and other hazards. At
night the fences and barricades so erected shall be marked with flares or
windproof lights. (Ord. 2005-17. Passed 9-13-05.)
1321.06 BACKFILLING EXCAVATIONS.
   (a)   All components of the demolished structure including concrete floors
and block walls shall be hauled from the site. Foundation and utility
excavations outside the road right-of- way shall be filled with clean soil
containing no refuse or wood. The fill shall be installed and compacted in
lifts to obtain a minimum of ninety percent (90%) maximum density at optimum
moisture content as determined by a modified proctor test. The Village
Administrator may require on-site testing to assure proper compaction is
obtained. The applicant shall be responsible for the costs for testing should
it be required and shall supply an adequate sample of the material proposed for
backfill well in advance of the scheduled work. Concrete and concrete block may
only be used for backfill when it is mixed with granular material so as not to
alter the compactability of the solid when it is crushed to pass one hundred
percent (100%) through a three-inch sieve.
   (b)   The filling of such excavation shall not be required when a building
permit has been issued for a new building on the site and the construction
thereof is to be started within sixty days after completion of the wrecking
operation. However, in such event, the holder of the building permit shall
surround such excavation with a substantial fence protecting all sides to a
height specified by the Village Administrator. All adjacent streets, alleys and
sidewalks shall be kept free and clear of all rubbish, refuse and loose
material resulting from the wrecking and removal operations. (Ord. 2005-17.
Passed 9-13-05.)
1321.07 SITE RESTORATION.
   (a)   The owner of the premises being moved or wrecked shall be responsible
for restoring the affected site as required by Section
1321.06 and, in the event this site is not being reconstructed on as regulated
by Section
1321.06, shall insure that a minimum of 3" of topsoil is placed over any area
which has been backfilled and the area shall be graded to properly drain
without ponding or erosion and shall be seeded in lawn, and maintained to
insure property revegetation. This requires an excavation permit and bond in
addition to the demolition permit and bond requirements.
   (b)   Where there is a driveway and curb cut existing, and there is no
identified, proposed use for said driveway, then the owner shall be responsible
for restoring the curb cut and removing the drive approach.
(Ord. 2005-17. Passed 9-13-05.)
1321.08 TIME LIMIT.
   Any wrecking work shall be completed within thirty days from the date of
issuance of the permit, except that such time may be extended for an additional
thirty days for good cause shown, upon application to the Village
Administrator. If the wrecking work is not completed within thirty days or
sixty days if an additional thirty days has been granted, then the Village
Administrator shall immediately employ labor to complete the operation and
deduct the cost thereof from the cash deposit provided above. However, if the
cash deposit is insufficient to pay for the cost thus incurred by the Village
Administrator, then either the one to whom a permit was issued or the owner of
the property, jointly or severally, shall be liable to the Village for
reimbursement for such additional cost.
(Ord. 2005-17. Passed 9-13-05.)
