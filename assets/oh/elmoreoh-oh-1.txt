   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the

meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the Municipality,
any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a
misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the failure to do
any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is otherwise

the Village of Elmore.
   (a)   The officers or positions authorized to use a credit card account are
listed on the “Authorized User List” maintained by the Village Fiscal Officer.
Said list shall show the authorized user by name, office, or position. It shall
also list the date of approval by Council, the card or cards authorized to be
used, and when applicable, the date authorization is terminated, e.g.
      Authorized User    Date Council      Authorized Credit   Date
Authorization
               Approved      Card Account      Terminated
                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                     
   (b)   The expense for which a credit card account may be used only include
purchases or work-related goods and services incurred on behalf of the Village.
Such work-related goods and services include, but are not limited to, gasoline
for Village vehicles, meal allowances, and equipment/parts purchased on behalf
of a Village project.
      No single credit card transaction may exceed five hundred dollars
($500.00). In the event of an emergency, the authorized user shall notify the
fiscal officer of the need to spend an amount in excess of the limit. Village
Administrator, David Hower, is authorized up to five thousand dollars ($5,000)
per credit card transaction.
   (c)   Guidelines for Acquisition, Use, and Management.  
      (1)   Acquisition. Council must authorize an individual to use a Credit
Card account before a person may become an Authorized User and acquire access
to a Credit Card or other presentation instrument associated with a Credit Card
Account. The Council may place limits on the authorization of use of a Credit
Card at such time as a person receives authorization to use a credit card or
any time thereafter, at the Council’s discretion and upon notice to the
Authorized user. Upon the Council’s authorization, the person receiving
authorization must sign a copy of Exhibit A attached to original Ordinance 08-
20, acknowledging he or she received a copy of this policy and agreeing to
abide by it.
      (2)   Permitted Uses. Authorized Users may use a Credit Card Account for
Authorized Expenses, as described in subsection (b) hereof of this Policy,
incurred only by the Authorized User. An Authorized User may not transfer the
Credit Card or purchase goods on behalf of any other person, regardless of
whether the person is an employee of the Village or is purchasing goods or
services for the Village. Authorized Users may, unless otherwise prohibited by
Council, use a Credit Card in person, online, over telephone, by mail, or
through fax. All purchases must be evidenced by an itemized receipt. If
purchasing goods online, the Authorized User must use reasonable care and
judgment regarding the authenticity and security of a website.
      (3)   Reasonable Care. Authorized Users must use reasonable care when
using a Credit Card.
      (4)   Notification of Purchase. Prior to using a Credit Card, the
Authorized User should make a good faith effort to notify Council, their
authorized representative, or the Fiscal Officer of the intended purchase of
goods or services that are not routine.
      (5)   Storage. Authorized Users must take measures to ensure Credit
Cards, checkbooks, and any other presentation instruments associated with a
Credit Card Account are kept in a secure place at all times.
      (6)   Receipts. Original, itemized receipts must be submitted to the
Fiscal Officer as soon as reasonably possible. The receipt should include the
customer copy of the receipt, any invoice from the vendor, the cost of goods or
services purchased, and the date of the purchase. The Authorized User should
also submit documentation verifying the purchase was made on behalf of the
Village, if necessary to describe the purchase.
      (7)   Return of the Credit Card to Village. The Authorized User, upon
resignation, termination, or change in position within the Village shall return
the Credit Card to the Fiscal Officer immediately. Additionally, the Credit
Card shall be immediately returned if the Village revokes authorization to use
the Credit Card or request the return of the Credit Card.
      (8)   All Credit Cards shall be in the possession of the Fiscal Officer
when not in use. The Credit Card may be held by an authorized user for a
reasonable length of time to complete a transaction. In no event shall a Credit
Card be held by an authorized user for more than three days.
      (9)   Authorized users shall sign out and sign in credit cards on the
Sign Out/in sheet provided by the Fiscal Officer.
   (d)   Liability. The Authorized User will be personally responsible for
reimbursing the Village for any of the following:
      (1)   Expenses charged to the Credit Card that are not documented and
submitted to the Fiscal Officer or the Fiscal Officer designee;
      (2)   Expenses that exceed the scope of the authorization allotted by
Council of the Authorized User’s use of the Credit Card;
      (3)   Unauthorized expenses;
      (4)   Purchases the Authorized User allowed an unauthorized user to make;
      (5)   Any other purchases made with the Credit Card that are in violation
of the Policy, and the amendments and supplements thereto.
   (e)   Unauthorized Expenses. Any purchase made beyond specific authorization
limits imposed by Council, if any, or what is authorized in this Policy, is an
unauthorized expense. The use of a Credit Card Account for personal expenses is
expressly prohibited. Personal expenses include those expenses that are not
incurred as a direct result of the Authorized User’s employment with the
Village. Personal expenses include, but are not limited to, gasoline for
personal vehicles, cash advances, any amount in excess of meal allowances,
alcoholic beverages, tobacco, gambling, and personal goods.
   (f)   Misuse. Using a Credit Card for Unauthorized Expenses, as the same are
discussed in subsection (e) hereof, constitutes misuse. Failing to submit
receipts, or submitting incomplete information, within a reasonable time after
making a purchase also constitutes misuse.
      Any public servant, as the same is defined in Section 2921.01 of the
Revised Code of Ohio, who knowingly misuses a Credit Card will be subject to
criminal prosecution pursuant to Section 2913.21 of the Revised Code of Ohio.
Misuse of a Credit Card may result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination.
   (g)   Issuing and Re-issuing a Credit Card. A Credit Card should be issued
or re-issued at the discretion of Council. Upon the written request of an
employee, prior Authorized User, or Authorized User, Council may re-issue a
Credit Card.
   (h)   Cancellation and Stolen/Lost Credit Cards. An individual Credit Card
connected to a Credit Card Account should be cancelled upon the determination
of Council, the Mayor, or Village Administrator.
      In the event a Credit Card is lost or stolen, or the Authorized User has
reason to believe a Credit Card is lost or stolen or used in an unauthorized
manner, the Authorized User shall immediately notify the Fiscal Officer in
person or by phone and in writing. The Fiscal Officer must notify the card
issuer immediately. The Authorized User must provide all necessary information
required by the Village or the card issuer relating to the disappearance of the
Credit Card.
   (i)   Credit Card Account Limits. The credit limit on each Credit Card
Account held by the Village is included in Exhibit B attached to original
Ordinance 08-20 incorporated herein by reference and should be updated upon any
change of limits or additional credit lines.
   (j)   Credit Card Account Instruments. The Village’s name shall appear on
each presentation instrument related to the Credit Card Account, including but
not limited to Credit Cards and checks.
   (k)   Annual Reports. The Fiscal Officer annually shall file a report with
the Council detailing all rewards received, based on the use of the Credit Card
Accounts.
   (l)   Administrative Duties. Each month the Fiscal Officer shall present a
Credit Card Account transaction detail from the previous month to the Council.
Council shall review the Credit Card Account transaction detail and the
President of Council shall sign an attestation stating Council reviewed the
Credit Card Account transaction detail.
   (m)   Quarterly Report. The Fiscal Officer and Council shall review the
number of active cards and accounts issued, the cards’ and accounts’ expiration
dates, and the cards’ and accounts’ credit limits.

149.01 MISSION STATEMENT.
   Openness leads to a better informed citizenry, which leads to better
government and better public policy. It is the mission and intent of the
Village of Elmore to at all times fully comply with and abide by both the
spirit and the letter of Ohio's Public Records Act.
(Res. R6-20. Passed 8-10-20.)
 
149.02 DEFINING PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   A “record”is defined to include the following: a document in any
format-paper, electronic (including, but not limited to, business email)- that
is created, received by or comes under the jurisdiction of the Village of
Elmore that documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions,
procedures, operations, or other activities of the Village.
   (b)   A “public record” is a “record” that is being kept by this office at
the time a public records request is made, subject to applicable exceptions
from disclosure under Ohio or federal law. All public records must be organized
and maintained in such a way that they can be made available for inspection and
copying.
(Res. R6-20. Passed 8-10-20.)
 
149.03 RESPONSE TIMEFRAME.
   (a)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours. Public records must be made available for inspection promptly.
Copies of public records must be made available within a reasonable amount of
time. “Prompt” and “Reasonable” take into account the volume of records
requested, the proximity of the location where the records are stored, the
necessity for any legal review and redaction, and other facts and circumstances
of the records requested.
   (b)   It is the goal of the Village of Elmore that all requests for public
records should be acknowledged in writing or, if feasible, satisfied within
three business days following the office’s receipt of the request.
(Res. R6-20. Passed 8-10-20.)
149.04 HANDLING REQUESTS.
   (a)   No specific language is required to make a request for public records.
However, the requester must at least identify the records requested with
sufficient clarity to allow the office to identify, retrieve, and review the
records.
   (b)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing and
does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record(s). It is our general policy that this information is
not to be requested. However, the law does permit us to ask for a written
request, the requester’s identity, and/or the intended use of the information
requested, but only if:
      (1)   A written request or disclosure of identity or intended use would
benefit the requester by enhancing the ability to identify, locate, or deliver
the public records that have been requested, and
      (2)   The requester is first told that a written request is not required
and that the requester may decline to reveal the requester’s identity or
intended use.
   (c)   In processing the request, we do not have an obligation to create new
records or perform a search or research for information in the office’s
records. An electronic record is deemed to exist so long as a computer is
already programmed to produce the record through the office’s standard use of
sorting, filtering, or querying features. Although not required by law, we will
consider generating new records when it makes sense and is practical under the
circumstances.
   (d)   In processing a request for inspection of a public record, an office
employee may accompany the requester during inspection to make certain original
records are not taken or altered.
   (e)   A copy of the most recent edition of the Ohio Sunshine Laws Manual is
available via the Ohio Attorney General’s website (www.OhioAttorneyGeneral.gov/
YellowBook) for the purpose of keeping employees of the office and the public
educated as to the office’s obligations under Ohio’s Public Records Act, Ohio’s
Open Meetings Act, records retention laws, and the Personal Information Systems
Act.
(Res. R6-20. Passed 8-10-20.)
149.05 ELECTRONIC RECORDS.
   (a)   Records in the form of email, text messaging, including those sent and
received via a hand-held communications device, are to be treated in the same
fashion as records in other formats, such as paper or audiotape.
   (b)   Public records content transmitted to or from private accounts or
personal devices is subject to disclosure. All employees or representatives are
required to retain their email records and other electronic records in
accordance with applicable records retention schedules.
(Res. R6-20. Passed 8-10-20.)
 
149.06 DENIAL OR REDACTION OF RECORDS.
   (a)   If the requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has
difficulty in making a request such that the office cannot reasonably identify
what public records are being requested, the request may be denied, but the
office must then provide the requester an opportunity to revise the request by
informing the requester of the manner in which the records are maintained and
accessed by the office.
   (b)   If the office withholds, redacts, or otherwise denies requested
records, it must provide an explanation, including legal authority for the
denial(s). If the initial request was made in writing, the explanation must
also be in writing. If portions of a record are public and portions are exempt,
the exempt portions may be redacted, and the rest must be released. When making
public records available for public inspection or copying, the office shall
notify the requester of any redaction or make the redaction plainly visible.
(Res. R6-20. Passed 8-10-20.)
 
149.07 COPYING AND MAILING COSTS.
   (a)   Those seeking public records may be charged only the actual cost of
making copies, not labor. The charge for paper copies is five cents (5¢) per
page. The charge for electronic files downloaded to a compact disc is ond
dollar ($1.00) per disc.
   (b)   A requester may be required to pay in advance for the actual costs
involved in providing the copy. The requester may choose whether to have the
record duplicated upon paper, upon the same medium on which the public record
is kept, or upon any other medium on which the office determines that the
record can reasonably be duplicated as an integral part of the office’s normal
operations.
   (c)   If a requester asks that documents be delivered to them, he or she may
be charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies, or other actual
costs of delivery. There is no charge for emailed documents.
(Res. R6-20. Passed 8-10-20.)
149.08 MANAGING RECORDS.
   The Village of Elmore’s records are subject to records retention schedules.
The Village’s current schedules are available at 344 Rice Street, Elmore, Ohio,
a location readily available to the public as required by the Ohio Revised Code
Section 149.43(B)(2).
(Res. R6-20. Passed 8-10-20.)
 
149.09 RECORDS COMMISSION.
   (a)   Pursuant to the provisions of Ohio R.C. 149.39, there is hereby
created a revised Elmore Municipal Records Commission and any existing language
in any other ordinance that may be in conflict with this section is hereby
repealed.
   (b)   The revised Records Commission shall consist of:
      (1)   The Village Fiscal Officer, who shall serve as the Chairperson of
the Commission.
      (2)   The Village Superintendent.
      (3)   A member of the Council appointed by the Mayor for the term of the

      (6)   The Village Police Chief.
      (7)   A citizen of the Village to be appointed for a two (2) year term by
the Mayor.
   (c)   All record retention record schedules shall be amended or include the
following: Federal Assistance Applications, Paperwork and Agreements - 30
Years.
   (d)   The Records Commission shall hold meetings annually on the first
Monday in October, and/or such additional meetings at such time and place as
designated by the Chairperson of the Commission. (Ord. 3-13. Passed 3-11-13.)
TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap. 171.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution
for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all
criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State highways
located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the defendant to
trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury at
any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)   Does not waive his right to trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by laws includes confinement for more than
six months, or
   (b)   Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United States
Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was compelled
to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's court
provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was denied a
trial before a disinterested and impartial magistrate as guaranteed by the due
process clause of the United States Constitution.
The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which prescribe
the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases. Rule 9(A)
thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23
referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the Mayor
may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v. Village of
Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex rel. Brockman v. Procter, 35
Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is entitled to a
jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, the Mayor
shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury demand is not
made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives his right to
jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his compensation as a
judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he is
not the chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality and as
such responsible for the financial condition of the municipality. Guilty and no
contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including Mayors whose compensation as
a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case convictions and Mayors who as
chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality are responsible
for the financial condition of the municipality."
The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in Rule
9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a written
order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court, continuing the
same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee court a
condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall transmit to
the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers in the case,
and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the clerk of the
transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the defendant by
ordinary mail of his trial date."
Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

Constitution. The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this

181.21.
181.014 STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY; STATE MANDATED CHANGES TO MUNICIPAL
INCOME TAX.
   (A)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by Am
Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 11-15, effective
January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends
Chapter 181 in accordance with the provisions of ORC 718 to allow the
Municipality to continue the income tax and withholding tax administration and
collection efforts on behalf of the Municipality.
(Ord. 11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.02 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   (A)   Ordinance 11-15, effective January 1, 2016, and corresponding changes
to ORC 718, apply to municipal taxable years beginning on or after January 1,
2016. All provisions of this
Chapter 181 apply to taxable years beginning 2016 and succeeding taxable years.
   (B)   Ordinance 11-15 does not repeal the existing sections of
Chapter 181 for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather amends
Chapter 181 effective January 1, 2016. For municipal taxable years beginning
before January 1, 2016, the Municipality shall continue to administer, audit,
and enforce the income tax of the Municipality under ORC 718 and ordinances and
resolutions of the Municipality as that chapter and those ordinances and
resolutions existed before January 1, 2016.
(Ord. 11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.03 DEFINITIONS.
Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter has
the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.
As used in this chapter:
   (1)   "ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division 23(D) of this section, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (A)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (B)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (C)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
      (D)   (i)    Except as provided in division (1 )(D)(ii) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (ii)   Division (1 )(D)(i) of this section does not apply to the
extent the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250
of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (E)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
      (F)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
      (G)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Ohio Revised Code;
      (H)   (i)    Except as limited by divisions (1 )(H)(ii), (iii) and (iv)
of this section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a
taxable year beginning on or after January 1 , 2017. The amount of such net
operating loss shall be deducted from net profit that is reduced by exempt
income to the extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable income to zero, with
any remaining unused portion of the net operating loss carried forward to not
more than five consecutive taxable years following the taxable year in which
the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than necessary for the
deduction to be fully utilized.
         (ii)   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (1)(H) of
this section to offset qualifying wages.
         (iii)   (a)    For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021,
or 2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a

   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting

used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
181.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of section
181.051 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.053 COLLECTION AT SOURCE; CASINO AND VLT.
   (A)   The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino operator,
as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and section
3772.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, respectively, or a lottery sales agent
conducting video lottery terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and
remit municipal income tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages
as provided in this section.
   (B)    If a person's winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person's winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
   (C)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in trust
for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall
file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the Municipality,
providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of
the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of casino
gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information required by
the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the
preceding month.
      (2)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year. The casino operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any
amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted. If
the name, address, or social security number of a person or the amount deducted
and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual
return.
      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or filed
late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the
rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
181.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
181.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
181.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
181.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

181.03 (32) of this Chapter.
(Ord. 11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.062 NET PROFIT; INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX; ALTERNATIVE
APPORTIONMENT.
This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in the
Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)    Except as provided in divisions (B)(1) and (I) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
 
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not-required to be withheld under Section
181.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
181.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
181.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3), and except as provided in
division (I) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals made and services
performed shall be situs to a municipal corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
situs to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be situs to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be situs to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
situs to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be situs to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
   A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit situs under this division
to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)    Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be situs to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
181.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11 )(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
181.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer.
"Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an employee or
owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that imposes an
income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may have more
than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section
181.051 of this Ordinance, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for the
performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (l)(l)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (l)(l)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of section 192.062 apply to such apportionment except as
otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (I)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (A) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (A)(3) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (1)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section 192.051 of this Ordinance.

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
181.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of 181.03 of
this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
situs to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
situs to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
181.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
situs to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
181.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year

liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the

installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section 181.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.

181.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:

the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.

hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with

181.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
181.081 INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK.
181.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121 (v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)    Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident of
the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created under
section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under section
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
181.081 of this Chapter.

181.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.

should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
181.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
181.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
181.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)

the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.

circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
181.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)    As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
181.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
      The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement:
      "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within the municipal
corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during the taxable year.
If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation,
if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's resolutions,
ordinances, or rules ." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of
perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year.
   Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to

otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)

which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)   For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or

for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of
Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall
be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to

   (C)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.

corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs incurred to
respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.

under division (C) of this section.

state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section

requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
181.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.096 REFUNDS.

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/ or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
181.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section

Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

181.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   (1)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 11-15. Passed
11-23-15.)
181.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
181.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
181.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
181.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
181.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
(Ord. 11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.15 FRAUD.
No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation or
presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
181.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section
718.18 of the Revised Code is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete
and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)    A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)    The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.

preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful. and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 11-15. Passed 11-23-15.)
181.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
181.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,

   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
181.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
181.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.

   (a)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation, upon complaint of any person adversely affected may order into
storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private residential or
private agricultural property for at least four hours without the permission of
the person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left
at the garage or place of storage for a longer period than that agreed upon.
When ordering a motor vehicle into storage pursuant to this section, the chief
may arrange for the removal of the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall
designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under subsection (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that subsection.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the
vehicle only in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.
      (4)   As used in this section "private residential property" means
private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures. "Private
residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the
property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle
owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and
the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to the owner or
operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately shall move it so
that it is not on the private residential or private agricultural property
without the permission of the person having the right to possession of the
property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without the permission of
the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The chief of a law enforcement agency in the municipal

removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person
from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

303.991 COMMITTING AN OFFENSE WHILE DISTRACTED PENALTY.
   (a)   As used in this section and each section of the Traffic Code where
specified, all of the following apply:
      (1)   “Distracted” means doing either of the following while operating a
vehicle:
         A.   Using an electronic wireless communications device, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, in violation of that section.
 
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time. A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section
331.43.
      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
      As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

of the parade.
   (f)    The permit or any order accompanying it may limit or prescribe
reasonable conditions, including the hours, the place of assemblage and of
dispersal, the route of march or travel in the streets, highways, or portions
thereof which may be used or occupied. Use of bullhorns or sound amplification
equipment for such events is prohibited after midnight.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. No
provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be enforced
against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged violation
an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible to be seen
by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of this
Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree. If the offender commits the offense while
distracted and the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the
commission of the offense, the offender is subject to the additional fine
established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have the
following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the

person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.

admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that

         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to

in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense

requires the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’
intervention program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.

requires the offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’
intervention program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term
equal to the remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not
spend attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition
of community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or

that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
            If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time
offender under Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by
the court under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply,
except that the court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term

sanction imposed under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete
any treatment or education programs that comply with the minimum standards
adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and
Addiction Services, in addition to the required attendance at drivers’
intervention program, that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program
determine that the offender should attend and to report periodically to the
court on the offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose any
other conditions of community control on the offender that it considers
necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars

by a community addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C.
5119.21, subject to subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the
offender to follow the treatment recommendations of the services provider. The
purpose of the assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol

of the court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment
to the court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses
related to alcohol use.

      (1)   A.   Twenty miles per hour in school zones during school recess and
while children are going to or leaving school during the opening or closing
hours, and when twenty miles per hour school speed limit signs are erected;
except, that on controlled-access highways and expressways, if the right-of-way
line fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be
governed by subsection (b)(4) hereof and on freeways, if the right-of-way line
fence has been erected without pedestrian opening, the speed shall be governed
by subsection (b)(7) hereof. The end of every school zone may be marked by a

and specifications for a uniform system of traffic control devices shall be
construed to require school zones to be indicated by signs equipped with
flashing or other lights, or giving other special notice of the hours in which
the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;
            2.    Any nonchartered school that during the preceding year filed
with the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce in compliance with O.A.C. §

traditional school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines,
except when those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A.
and C. hereof.

submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic and other
information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet

shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof. If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof. If it
finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit declared
or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider whether the
evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.

335.01 DRIVER'S LICENSE OR COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIRED.
   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a

   The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed
by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A)
of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

does not exceed the total number of occupant restraining devices originally
installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or B. hereof has been or
is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest of or commencing a
prosecution of a person for such violation.
   (g)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Occupant restraining device” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4513.263.
      (2)   “Family member” of a probationary license holder includes any of
the following:
         A.   A spouse;

         F.   A son or daughter of the probationary license holder’s stepparent
if the stepparent has not adopted the probationary license holder;
         G.   An eligible adult, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4507.05.
      (3)   “Moving violation” means any violation of any statute or ordinance
that regulates the operation of vehicles, streetcars, or trackless trolleys on
the highways or streets. “Moving violation” does not include a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4513.263 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
violation of any statute or ordinance regulating pedestrians or the parking of
vehicles, vehicle size or load limitations, vehicle fitness requirements, or

age of eighteen years and no holder of a probationary driver’s license shall
drive a motor vehicle on any street, highway, or property used by the public
for purposes of vehicular traffic or parking while using in any manner an
electronic wireless communications device.
   (b)   Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to either of the
following:
      (1)   A person using an electronic wireless communications device for
emergency purposes, including an emergency contact with a law enforcement

permit for a definite period of one year.
   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct. However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated
a delinquent child or a juvenile traffic offender for a violation of a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same conduct, the two

plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C.
4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially equivalent

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the order shall be
issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed in
accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

of a motor vehicle.
   (h)   For purposes of this section, a vehicle is owned by a person if, at

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the offender may be
ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a

criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.
4507.35 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a

violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

pleaded guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.11 or Ohio R.C. 4510.111 or

offender, may order the immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense
for thirty days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for thirty
days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         B.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

other sentence that it imposes on the offender may order the immobilization of
the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

necessary measures to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased
by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of

list three desired project start dates with 1-3 listed from most to least
desired start date. The form will be filed with the Police Chief and/or
Administrator who will note the date and time it is submitted. The
Administrator will then submit the form to the Elmore Police Department who
will attempt to accommodate the business owner according to its requested
dates. If one of the initial proposed dates is available then the Police Chief
will issue a permit to use the parking spaces for the construction phase of the
business owner’s project. If those dates or spaces are not available at that
time, the Police Department will either send the request back to the
Administrator who will then contact the business owner and allow them to
propose another three start dates without losing their place in line, or
contact the business owner directly. If the second set of requested dates is
not available, the business owner must start the procedure over and submit a
new set of dates and start back at the end of the line with a new date and time
stamp which will allow parity in the application process. These permits are
valid for thirty (30) days unless otherwise specified.
   (c)   Each 30-day permit will consist of an allowance for a dumpster no
larger than one parking space, and one additional parking space for the main
contractor’s vehicle. It is possible to get a 10-day extension for the parking
space for a contractor’s vehicle, as long as the request is submitted within 15
days after the approved permit start date. There will be no extension for
dumpster space usage, only for contractor vehicle usage. If the business
finishes the demolition and materials removal portion of their project early,
they will still retain usage of two parking spots in front of their business to
be used by contractors ONLY.
   d)   Both parking spots will be roped off by the business owner who is
responsible for the enforcement of the spot usage. If the rules and guidelines
for use are not following appropriately, then both the contractors as well as
the business owner may be ticketed. This violation is a minor misdemeanor with
a maximum fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each day of violation.
Responsibilities are shared by the business owner as well as the contractors
for hire. The main contractor will hold one parking spot with an approved
permit, plus extensions. All other workmen that park in the downtown area, on
Rice Street, will be given a traffic citation for a parking violation.
   (e)   Dumpster Parking Space Placement. At no time will there be any more
than two projects on one side of the street and one project on the other side
going on to take up parking spots in downtown Elmore. This scheduling issue
should be handled via the permit issuance process.
   (f)   Permit Application Text Based Flow Chart.
      (1)   Applicant submits form to Administrator or Police Chief.
      (2)   Administrator time stamps and sends to Police Department for
review.

Administrator or applicant.

meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
      "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of
his complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
      "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
         “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence
does not become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral
turpitude, or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a
witness may affect the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
         It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.

offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
(ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General

anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

artistic purpose.

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05, 545.06, or 545.08, 545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or 545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
is committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections 545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05, 545.06 or 545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or 545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single
offense. If the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Section
545.05 or 545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active
duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions of

The Commission shall have the power and duties to check sidewalks for needs of
repair, replacement or maintenance. The Commission shall be responsible for

repairs, maintenance, or construction of sidewalks in areas where sidewalks are
deemed necessary.
(Ord. 12-92. Passed 5-21-92.)
901.03 SIDEWALK MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.
Any sidewalk or parts thereof that is uneven, broken up, cracked, has grass or

endanger the life, health, safety or property of the public, shall be, and
hereby is declared to be a public nuisance. The owner of the property on which

the surface drainage from adjacent areas. All sidewalks shall be installed with
a maximum transverse slope of one-quarter inch of fall per foot of walk width.

Agreement shall be used to document the agreement between the Utility and the
customer.
   Payment of utility bills by other than cash means, including but not limited
to credit card payment, electronic payment, or Internet payment is authorized
subject to implementation and acceptance by the Village of Elmore.
   (e)    Voluntary Termination of Service.  Requests for voluntary
disconnection of electrical service must be made, in writing, at the Village’s
Public Works Department and shall be approved by the customer contractually
obligated to pay charges incurred at the service premises.
   A customer who intends to move from the service premises or discontinue the
use of electrical and/or water service or in any way terminate their liability
hereunder, shall give the Village’s Public Works Department a notice of such
intention not later than forty-eight (48) hours before moving and the customer
shall be liable for all electrical service, and if applicable, water service,
and meter charges that may be used upon the service premises until such notice
is given and the Village’s Public Works Department has made the final meter
reading.
   (f)   Nonpayment and Disconnection. The charge for reinstalling any meter
taken out because of nonpayment of a bill is fifty dollars ($50.00). Meters
will be reinstalled on the same day no later than 11:00 pm.
   Consumers who are one month behind and/or a one hundred dollar ($100.00)
balance shall be sent shut off notices ten (10) days prior to the proposed
termination of service. The notice will include the date of the proposed
termination, the reason for the termination and a statement that the resident
can avoid the termination by paying the current balance. The notice will
provide the address and business hours of the office at which payment of
delinquent amounts are accepted.
   A 20-amp limited meter may be installed when an account is delinquent or at
the discretion of the Village Administrator or designee. The 20-amp limited
meter will be removed when the agreed amount is paid.
   Disconnections must be made on a day on which reconnection is available the
following day. The person performing the disconnection should attempt to
contact the occupants at the address to be disconnected by means such as
knocking at the door. A notice should be delivered to the occupant and placed
at the entrance to the service address. The notice should state the reason for
the termination, the amount left unpaid and/or fee for reconnection, and the
location and hours of the office. The municipal representative will be
authorized to accept payment for past due amounts or may contact the office.
   Disconnection of service for nonpayment will not occur when disconnect of
service would be especially dangerous to health as certified pursuant to the
certification provisions of this rule;
however, (when available) a limiter may be installed on your service. Customer
may, to avoid disconnect, enter into, and make payment in accordance with an
extended payment plan.
   No disconnect for residential service will occur for nonpayment at times
when temperatures are below freezing on any given day; however, a limiter (when
available) may be installed on your service.
   When a Village resident changes address within the Village and has a balance
at the “old” address, it must be paid in full before utilities can be put in
their name at the “new” address.
   (g)   Electric.  The Village of Elmore will maintain the tennis court lights
at the school. The Village of Elmore will supply the electricity free of charge
and the use of our equipment and servicemen for maintenance. The Kiwanis will
purchase and supply the parts. Free electricity to the tennis courts was
established by Ordinance #504 in 1976.
   The Village of Elmore will extend electric service if fifty percent (50%) of
the current homes in an area that requests service, and if it is an area
economically feasible for the Village to proceed with the investment.
   Underground service will cost five hundred dollars ($500.00) for the 1st
seventy-five (75) feet and six dollars and seventy-five cents ($6.75) per
additional foot. The minimum charge for new overhead electrical construction
will cost four hundred dollars ($400.00) per residence outside the corporate
limits. There will be no charge for an overhead service inside the corporate
limits.
    The Village will contribute fifty percent (50%) aid to construction cost
for a consumer with a high demand requiring a 50 KVA transformer or higher.
This contribution will be levied to aid in the cost of construction.
   (h)   Single Billing.  If Service Is Supplied Thru Single Service Drop:
Where service is supplied through a single service drop either three (3) or
four (4) wires extending to a single service entrance and meter location
designated by Utility, a single bill will be rendered, whether Utility elects
to use single or multiple metering.
   Requirements to Qualify for Single Billing: If Consumer arranges his wiring
at his cost so that all requirements can be supplied by means of a single three
(3) or four (4) wire service drops extending to a single meter location
designated by the Utility Department and providing that such service can be
supplied from a single transformer bank and metered thru a single meter, a
single bill will be rendered for such service.
   (i)   Multiple Billing. Where service is supplied through multiple service
drops: Where service is delivered at different meter locations through
individual and separately metered single and 3-phase service drops a separate
bill will be rendered for each service drop location.
   (j)   Meter Testing. When the accuracy of a meter is questioned, upon
written request from the Consumer, the Utility will test the meter. If the
meter is found to be correct within plus or minus two percent (2%), to
partially cover the expense to make such a test, the applicable charge
specified in the applicable power rate schedule shall be paid by Consumer to
the Utility. Prior to any test, Utility reserves the right to require a Deposit
to cover said Charge.
   If the meter being tested is found to be more than two percent (2%) slow or
fast, no charge shall be made for testing and the Utility will adjust the bill
in proportion to the error (either fast or slow) for the period covered by the
bill in question and to the date of installation of a new meter but said
adjustment period shall not exceed ninety (90) days.
   In the event of the stoppage of or the failure of any meter to register the
full amount of electricity consumed, the customer will be billed for such
billing period on an estimated consumption basis which will be based upon
customer’s normal use of electricity in a similar period during the time the
meter was registering correctly.
   The Village of Elmore Utilities Department shall complete a meter analysis
of all meters used on large power users every five years. For all large power
users (usage > 30 kW average for 12- month period), testing will occur every
year to ensure accuracy of the meter.
   (k)   Radio Meters.  All radio read meters will be operated and maintained
in accordance with the same general provisions that apply to the meters.
   In the event of a malfunction of a radio meter, a visual reading of the dial
on the meter shall govern.
   Occasionally, the Department shall verify that the remote register and the
meter are on the same reading. If adjustments are needed to make the remote
register equal to the meter dial, either a debit or credit shall be applied to
the following billing cycle, whichever is appropriate to properly “equalize”
the account for the associated meter.
   (l)   Power Quality. The Village of Elmore will do its’ utmost to provide
quality continuous electric power. Unforeseen events can interrupt electric
power flow. Computers should be provided with uninterruptible power supplies
purchased by the consumer. Voltage disturbances or distortions that originate
in customer equipment will not be permitted in excess of ANSI and IEEE
guidelines.
   (m)   Responsibility on Rentals.  Ohio Revised Code 743.04 state on property
owners, liability “A municipal ordinance which imposes liability on a property
owner for water services provided to a tenant on the premises does not violate
due process of law……… A city regulation holding landlords ultimately liable for
unpaid services that is provided in a tenant’s name to the tenant’s account, by
transferring the delinquency to the owner’s account when the tenant vacates the
premises, does not deprive the landlords of property without due process.”
   Effective February 2015; see Indemnification Agreement for landlord’s rules.
   (n)   Responsibility of Bills by Property Owner. Upon the effective date of
these Rules, in addition to other legal action allowed by law to collect unpaid
charges, the Village is entitled to follow the below procedure:
All bills and other charges due customers who are owners and occupy the
premises served by utility service, if not paid after same are due and payable,
shall be certified to the Auditor of Ottawa County along with certification
that the unpaid rents or charges have arisen pursuant to a service contract
made directly with the owner who occupies the property served. Such shall be a
lien on the property served, and the Auditor shall place same on the tax
duplicate of the County, together with the interest and penalties allowed by
law and to be collected by the County Treasurer. The lien shall be released
only upon payment in full of the certified amount.
   See Certification of Utility Charges Due to the Village of Elmore form to be
used for these charges. (Ord. 24-23. Passed 11-27-23.)

service would be especially dangerous to health as certified pursuant to the
certification provisions of this rule. Customer may, to avoid disconnect, enter
into, and make payment in accordance with an extended payment plan.
   No disconnect for residential service will occur for nonpayment at times
when temperatures are below freezing on any given day; however, a limiter (when
available) may be installed on your service.
   When a Village resident changes address within the Village and has a balance

919.08 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   A storm utility rate was authorized by Ordinance 011-94, June 28, 1994.
   There is hereby levied and imposed upon all premises which have been
improved within the Village just and equitable charges for storm drainage
service or subsequent service maintenance, operation, and extension; and to
establish a Storm Drainage Fund for the foregoing purposes.
   Such charges shall be collected with the monthly water bill of water users,
billed with sanitary sewer for those connected to sewer alone or billed alone
as storm drainage charge for those users not connected to and/or not charged
for City water and/or sanitary sewer.
   Such charges shall be paid monthly by those liable therefor and placed in a
Storm Drainage Fund into which all of such charges so collected shall be
deposited and kept as a fund to be used
only for the purposes stated herein.
   Fees are based on area rather than property values. In no year shall the
operating fund of the drainage utility show a loss.
   Because of the number of variables with apartments and business
arrangements, numerable
rules and policies are in effect to be fair and equitable to all.
   To cover the unknown factors to the village utility, the owner will bear the
cost of the unknown area and can at his option divide the cost among the
tenants, lessee, renters etc.
   An example would be a 10,000 sq ft impervious area subject to the storm
utility rate. If 2500 sq ft of that building was rented to a tenant known by
the utility, then one quarter of that utility rate billing would go to the
tenant. If that tenant had another 2500 sq ft rented that was unknown to the
utility, it would be the landlord or owner’s option to collect that portion.
   As stated in the ordinance the base rate for 3166 sq ft or less is four
dollars ($4.00). Any area more than 3166 sq ft will be on a percentage basis.
   Areas with more than one (1) tenant will have the four dollars ($4.00) fee
divided equally unless an unknown situation warrants a more equitable division.
In all cases a four dollar ($4.00) fee will be charged for 3166 sq ft or less,
whatever the breakdown of sq footage would be.
   A ten percent (10%) penalty will be assessed on all charges not paid by the
due date.

919.09 CABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   A formal agreement was signed in April 2014 between American Municipal Power
(AMP), the Ohio Municipal Electric Association (OMEA) and the Ohio Cable
Telecommunications Association (OCTA) to provide model rate structure and
policy for cable attachments to utility poles. The agreement only applies to
OMEA and AMP member municipalities in Ohio.
   Pursuant to the agreement, AMP and OMEA recommend standard pole attachment
rate for municipalities with fewer than 9,000 customers of eight dollars and
seventy-one cents ($8.71) in 2014 escalating at two percent (2%) per annum. AMP
and OMEA recommend that the members use a template agreement negotiated by AMP/
OMEA and OCTA. The agreement between AMP/OMEA and OCTA runs for ten (10) years
and is renewable at the end of that term with agreement from all parties.
   The template agreement as authored by the AMP/OMEA and OCTA shall be used to
provide a framework for all parties to agree to a specific rate for attaching
to the Village of Elmore utility poles. This agreement is available from the
Village Administrator.

APPENDIX A
POWER SUPPLY COST ADJUSTMENT APPLICABLE TO ALL VILLAGE’S
RATE SCHEDULES
In the event that the Village’s average power supply costs per kWh is INCREASED
or DECREASED due to changes in said resale base rate, fuel cost, tax, or other
adjustments or modifications to the Village's power supply arrangements,
Village's Rate Schedules to which Appendix "A" applies will be adjusted as
specified below:
1.    BASE POWER SUPPLY COST:
The overall Base Power Supply Cost to be used to determine the adjustment
applicable to Village's Rate Schedules shall be that included in the Village's
retail rates of $0.084000 per kWh.
2.    MONTHLY DETERMINATION OF POWER SUPPLY COST ADJUSTMENT:
   (a)    Each month, the Village's running three month average Power Supply
Cost per kWh shall be determined by dividing (1) the sum of the previous two
and current months’ total power supply costs from all suppliers, including
costs associated with development, ownership and operation of existing and
future generating resources, plus the sum of the previous two and current
months’ transmission related charges and AMP Service Fees, by (2) the total
energy delivered to the Village in the previous two months and current month.
   (b)    If said running three-month average Power Supply Cost for the current
month is ABOVE or BELOW $0.084000 per kWh (determined to 6 decimal places or
$0.000000), the rates per KWh set forth in Village's Rate Schedules shall be
INCREASED or DECREASED in the manner specified in (c) & (d) below.
   (c)    Any INCREASE or DECREASE per KWh ABOVE or BELOW the base cost of
$0.08400 per kWh shall be determined to 6 decimal places and any resultant
differential shall be multiplied by 1.10 to compensate for Village's
Distribution System Energy Losses.
   (d)    The rates per KWh set forth in Village's Rate Schedules shall be
INCREASED or DECREASED accordingly.
3.    APPLICATION OF POWER SUPPLY COST ADJUSTMENT TO ALL CUSTOMER BILLS:
   (a)    Any applicable adjustment shall be applied to the kWh billed Consumer
for the meter reading period that Village determines as most nearly
corresponding to the meter reading period(s) set forth in Village's purchased
power billings from its supplier(s).
   (b)    All adjustments shall be applied to the total kWh billed to Consumer
and shall be in addition to the minimum charge applicable for the schedule
involved.
   (c)    The above adjustment shall not be applicable to the Security Lighting
Service rate Schedule.

921.02 STORMWATER DRAINAGE UTILITY.
   (a)   It is hereby declared to be in the best interest of the Village to
form a structure and procedures designed to better manage stormwater and
provide for storm drainage improvements thus reducing combined sewer overflows,
recognizing that all real property within the Village should therefore be
assessed against such property.
   (b)   There is hereby established in the Village a Stormwater Utility, the
Village hereby declaring its intention to acquire, own, construct, equip,
operate and maintain open drainageways, underground storm drains, equipment,
appurtenances necessary, useful, or convenient for a complete stormwater
drainage system, including the maintenance, extension, and improvement of the
present storm drainage system.
   (c)   The Board of Public Affairs shall manage, conduct, and control the
Stormwater Drainage Utility, and is authorized to develop and adopt plans,
policies, and regulations necessary or desirable for the regulation and
operation of said utility.
   (d)   There is hereby levied and imposed upon all premises which have been
improved within the Village just and equitable charges for storm drainage
service or subsequent service maintenance, operation, and extension, and to
establish a Storm Drainage Fund for the foregoing purposes.
   (e)   Said charges shall be collected with the monthly water bill of water
users, billed with sanitary sewer for those connected to sewer alone, or billed
alone as a storm drainage charge for those users not connected to and/or not
charged for Village water and/or sanitary sewer.
   (f)   Said charges shall be paid monthly by those liable therefor, and
placed in a Storm Drainage Fund to be used only for the purposes stated within.
   (g)   It is hereby determined that property is furnished service in
proportion to the amount of the property's impervious surface. The basic unit
of service is 3,166 s.f. of impervious surface applicable to all conventionally
developed residential properties. All other properties shall be furnished
service equivalent to multiples of basic service units of 3,166 s.f. of
impervious surface as calculated for individual properties by the Village Board
of Public Affairs.
   (h)   Rates shall be set by action of Council. In no year shall the
operating fund of the utility show a loss.
   (i)   The rate for residential properties, which is based on a unit of
service of 3,166 s.f., shall be four dollars ($4.00) per month. All other
properties shall be billed at multiples of basic service units of 3,166 s.f.
per month.
   (j)   The established rates may be reduced for a property, other than a
conventionally developed one or two family property, where approved runoff
control measures have been implemented. Review and analysis of these measures
shall be handled on an individual case basis by the Board of Public Affairs.
The maximum rate reduction shall be fifty percent (50%) of the established
rate. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Public Affairs under
this section may appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Ottawa County, Ohio,
pursuant to Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
   (k)   The owner of any property subject to a charge provided herein shall
pay the same, when due, to the Village. If any charges due hereunder are not

The following rules are hereby established for the extension of water and sewer
services:
   (a)   Rule 1. No water or sewer services shall be extended to any users
outside the corporate limits of the Village except those water and sewer users
as of March 28, 1995, or except under the conditions set forth in Rules 2 and
3.
   (b)   Rule 2. The Village may extend water and sewer service to land which
is not within the present corporate boundaries provided, however, that before
such water and sewer service is extended the owner of such land must enter into
an agreement with the Village to obtain annexation of his property including
signing an annexation petition. However, the annexation agreement provisions of
this Rule shall not apply to land which is owned by the State of Ohio or
instrumentality of the State of Ohio or any commission created by Ohio R.C.
Chapter 5537.
   (c)   Rule 3. Those persons seeking water or sewer service installation or
extension in accordance with Rule 2 above, will be required to bear the entire
cost of such construction. All construction plans, specifications and
installation shall be subject to the approval of and be under the direct
supervision of the Village.

treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant effluent
cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over
discharge to the receiving waters.
      (9)   Any water or wastes which by interaction with other water or wastes
in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended solids
which interefere with the collection system, or create a condition deleterious
to structures and treatment processes.
      (10)   Any wastes with objectionable color not removable by the treatment
process. (Ord. 524. Passed 11-27-78.)
925.03 USE AND REQUIREMENTS OF PUBLIC SEWERS.
   (a)   Prohibition on Unpolluted Water. No person shall discharge or cause to
be discharged any (unpolluted) surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, storm
water, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water, or unpolluted
industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer. Any existing roof drain
connections to sanitary or combined sewers shall be connected into an available
storm sewer or shall be disconnected above ground in an appropriate manner
approved by Council. Discharges from roof drains emptying onto the ground
surface shall be at least three feet from the adjacent property line and shall
in no way be directed to flood or otherwise cause damage to adjoining property.
The owner of all buildings situated within the Village is required at his
expense to disconnect all existing roof drains from sanitary and combined
sewers in accordance with the provisions of this section within sixty days
after the date of official notice to do so. Discharge units connecting to a
Village Sanitary Sewer or Combination Sewer shall be free of all storm water.
It is prohibited that any new construction of discharge units shall have any
storm water connections of roof drains, footer and foundation tiles or any
other connection to a sanitary sewer or combination sewer.
(Ord. 524. Passed 11-27-78; Ord. 12-04. Passed 5-24-04.)
   (b)   Allowable Discharge of Unpolluted Water. Storm water and all other
unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically
designated as acceptable combined sewers or storm sewers or to a natural outlet
approved by Council and other regulatory agencies.
   (c)   Wastewater Discharge. Discharge units having sanitary water shall be
connected to a Village sanitary sewer, if one is within 200 feet of any of the
lot or property lines of that discharge unit. If a sanitary sewer is not
available within 200 feet of the lot or property line, the discharge unit shall
be connected to a combined sewer. In either such event, the connection shall be
water tight from the discharge unit to the sewer.
   (d)   No new connections or alterations to existing connections shall be
made to any of the sewer systems of the Village without prior permission of
Council or its authorized representative.
   (e)   Fees for connection to Village sewer shall be in accordance with a
schedule adopted by Council.
(Ord. 524. Passed 11-27-78.)
925.04 CONTROL OF PROHIBITED WASTES.
   (a)   Regulatory Actions. If wastewaters containing any substance described
in Section
925.02 are discharged or proposed to be discharged into the sewer system of the
Village or to any sewer system tributory thereto, the Superintendent or Village
Solicitor may take any action necessary to:
      (1)   Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater.
      (2)   Require a discharger to demonstrate that in-plant modifications
will control, reduce, or eliminate the discharge of such substances in
conformity with this chapter. This may include control over the quantities and
rates of discharge.
      (3)   Require pretreatment, including storage facilities, or flow
equalization necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics
or substances so that the discharge will not violate these rules and
regulations.
      (4)   Require the person making, causing or allowing the discharge to pay
any additional cost or expense incurred by the Village for handling and
treating excess loads imposed on the treatment system.
      (5)   Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be desirable or
necessary to achieve the purpose of this chapter.
   All industrial wastes discharged to the public sewers by major contributing
industries shall as a minimum meet the national pretreatment standards or best
practical control technology currently available for incompatible pollutants as
published in the latest Federal Regulations, unless the Village is committed,
in its NPDES Permit to remove a specified percentage of the incompatible
pollutant. In those instances the applicable pretreatment standards may be
correspondingly reduced to levels determined by the engineer, or his duly
authorized representative or State regulatory agencies.
   Special Conditions. No statement contained in this section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the
Village and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual
strength or character may be accepted by the Village for treatment, subject to
possible payment therefor by the industrial concern for subsequent treatment.
Any industrial concern may appeal to Council and determination made by the
engineer in the enforcement of this chapter.
   After passage of this chapter, each person whose operation entails the
discharge of industrial wastes to a public sewer shall prepare and file with
the engineer a written statement setting forth the nature of the operation
contemplated or presently carried on, the amount and source of water required
for use, the proposed point of discharge of such wastes into the wastewater
collection system of the Village for treatment, subject to possible payment
therefor by the industrial concern for subsequent treatment. Any industrial
concern may appeal to Council and determination made by the engineer in the
enforcement of this chapter.
   After passage of this chapter, each person whose operation entails the
discharge of industrial wastes to a public sewer shall prepare and file with
the engineer a written statement setting forth the nature of the operation
contemplated or presently carried on, the amount and source of water required
for use, the proposed point of discharge of such wastes into the wastewater
collection system of the Village, the estimated amount to be so discharged and
a fair statement setting forth the expected bacterial, physical, chemical, and
other known characteristics of the wastes. Within a reasonable time of receipt
of such statement, it shall be the duty of the Village to make an order stating
such minimum restrictions as in the judgment of the engineer may be necessary
to adequately guard against unlawful uses of the Village's wastewater system.
   (b)   Submission of Plans.
      (1)   Where pretreatment or equalization of wastewater flows prior to
discharge into any part of the wastewater treatment system is required, plans,
specifications, other pertinent data or information, including installation of
facilities and equipment relating to such pretreatment or flow-control
facilities shall be subject to the review and approval of the Superintendent.
Such approval shall not exempt the discharge or such facilities from compliance
with any applicable code, ordinance, rule, regulation or order of any
governmental authority. Any subsequent alterations or additions to such
pretreatment or flow-control facilities shall not be made without due notice to
and prior approval of the Superintendent.
      (2)   For grease, oil and inorganic material such as sand, grit, etc.,
interceptors shall be provided when in the opinion of the engineer, they are
necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease
in excessive amounts, as specified herein, or any flammable wastes, sand, or
other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required
for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a
type and a capacity approved by the engineer, and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining
of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal
and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain
records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject to review by the
Superintendent. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not
performed by the owner(s) personnel must be performed by currently licensed
waste disposal firms.
   (c)   Pretreatment Facilities Operations. If pretreatment of control of
waste flows is required, such facilities shall be continuously maintained in
good working order and operated as effectively and efficiently as possible by
the owner or operator at his own cost and expense, subject to the requirements
of these rules and regulations and all other applicable codes, ordinances, and
laws.
   (d)   Admission to Property. Whenever it shall be necessary for the purpose
of these rules and regulations, the Superintendent, upon the presentation of
credentials, may enter upon any property or premises at reasonable times for
the purpose of copying any records required to be kept under the provisions of
this chapter, inspecting any monitoring equipment or method, and sampling any
discharge of wastewater to the treatment works. The Superintendent may enter
upon the property at any hour under emergency circumstances.
   (e)   Protection from Accidental Discharge. Each industrial user shall
provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other
wastes regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner operator's
own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Superintendent
for review, and shall be approved by him before construction of the facility.
Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve
the industrial user from the responsibility to modify his facility as necessary
to meet the requirements of this chapter.
   (f)   Reporting of Accidental Discharge. If, for any reason, a facility does
not comply with or will be unable to comply with any prohibition or limitations
in this chapter, the facility responsible for such discharge shall immediately
notify the Superintendent so that corrective action may be taken to protect the
treatment system. In addition, a written report addressed to the Superintendent
detailing the date, time and cause of the accidental discharge, the quantity
and characteristics of the discharge and corrective action taken to prevent
future discharges, shall be filed by the responsible industrial facility within
five days of the occurrence of the noncomplying discharge.
(Ord. 524. Passed 11-27-78.)
925.05 INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER MONITORING AND REPORTING.
   (a)   Discharge Reports.
      (1)   Every significant industrial user shall file a periodic discharge
report at such intervals as are designated by the Superintendent. The
Superintendent may require any other industrial users discharging or proposing
to discharge into the treatment system to file such periodic reports.
      (2)   The discharge report shall include, but, in the discretion of the
Superintendent, shall not be limited to, nature of process, volume, rates of
flow, mass emission rate, production quantities, hours of operation,
concentrations of controlled pollutants or other information which relates to
the generation of waste. Such reports may also include the chemical
constituents and quantity of liquid materials stored on site even though they
are not normally discharged. In addition to discharge reports, the
Superintendent may require information in the form of self-monitoring reports.
   (b)   Records and Monitoring.
      (1)   All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge
wastewaters to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of
production and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts or
concentrations as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements
of this chapter and any applicable State or Federal pretreatment standards or
requirements.
      (2)   Such records shall be made available upon request by the
Superintendent. All such records relating to compliance with pretreatment
standards shall be made available to officials of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency upon demand. A summary of such data indicating the industrial
user's compliance with this chapter shall be prepared as requested and
submitted to the Superintendent.
      (3)   The owner or operator of any premises or facility discharging
industrial wastes into the system shall install at his own cost and expense
suitable control manholes or access points, and monitoring equipment to
facilitate the accurate observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes. Such
equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times. Sampling methods, location, times, durations, and
frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval by
the Superintendent.
      (4)   Wastewater Volume Determination.
         A.   The volume of flow used for computing industrial wastes
surcharges shall be metered water consumption of the person as shown in the
records of water meter readings maintained by the Village except as herein
provided in this paragraph.
         B.   If the person discharging industrial wastes into the public
sewers procures any part, or all, of this water from sources other than the
Village water system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewer,
the person shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of a type
approved by the engineer for the purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from those other sources.
         C.   The person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers
may install and maintain at his expense metering devices for determining the
volume of waste being discharged to the public sewer, from which the industrial
waste surcharge would be computed. The measuring devices shall be of a type
acceptable to the engineer.
         D.   The engineer may require the installation of devices for
measuring the volume of wastes discharged if these volumes cannot otherwise be
determined from the metered water consumption records. Any metering device for
determining the volume of waste discharged to the public sewer shall be
installed, owned and maintained by the person responsible for its discharge.
Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed without the
consent of the engineer.
      (5)   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Superintendent may
allow such facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area,
with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over such street or
sidewalk, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities,
landscaping or parked vehicles.
      (6)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Superintendent's
requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (c)   Inspection, Sampling and Analysis.
      (1)   Compliance determinations with respect to Section
925.02 may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or
composite samples of wastewater. Composite samples may be taken over a twenty-
four hour period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined
necessary by the Superintendent to meet the needs of specific circumstances.
         A.   Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be
subject to periodic inspection with a determination of character and
concentration of such wastes. The determination shall be made as often as may
be deemed necessary by the engineer but in no case less than two twenty-four
hour composite samples per month. The owner shall be responsible for the
collection and testing of the aforementioned samples.
         B.   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be
representative of the composition of the wastes. The sampling shall be
accomplished by the use of automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting
composite samples. Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the
engineer or his authorized representative at all times. Every care shall be
exercised in the collection of samples to insure their preservation in a state
comparable to that at the time the same was taken.
      (2)   Laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be
performed in accordance with the current edition of "Standard Methods" or the
"Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste" published by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. Analysis of those pollutants not covered by
these publications shall be performed in accordance with procedures established
by the State Environmental Protection Agency. However, alternative methods for
certain analyses of industrial wastes may be used subject to mutual agreement
between the engineer and the person responsible for its discharge.
Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial wastes shall
be made by the person responsible for the discharge, or his qualified agent as
approved by the engineer. The results of the analyses, shall be reported to the
Village on a monthly basis on forms provided by the Village. The Village shall
make its own analyses on the wastes and these determinations shall be binding
as a basis for charges, except under circumstances in the following paragraph.
In case the analyses performed by the industry and the Village result in
substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the industry to
collect samples at the same time the Village collects its own samples. The
results of the analyses on the samples collected by the Village and the
industry shall be compared using the same testing procedures as outlined in the
latest edition of "Standard Methods" and the differences negotiated.
(Ord. 524. Passed 11-27-78.)
925.06 APPLICABILITY OF SEWER RENTAL CHARGE.
   (a)   Where a sewer is available, it will be presumed that the waste from
the premises either will be discharged directly or indirectly into the sewerage
system and the property will be subject to the current sewer rental charges.
   (b)   Where premises are not served directly or indirectly by the sewerage
system and should be exempt from the sewer rental charge, it will be the
responsibility of the property owner or other interested party to notify the
Board of such claim for exemption. All lots, lands, buildings or premises owned
by the Village, may be exempt from the sewer rental charge.
(Ord. 524. Passed 11-27-78.)
925.07 LIEN OF SEWER RENTAL.

1111.02 BASE ZONING DISTRICT PURPOSE STATEMENTS.
   The following are the statements of purpose for each of the base zoning
districts established in this Zoning Ordinance.
   (a)   Rural Residential District (R-R). The Rural Residential District is
designed to:
      (1)   Preserve and protect for agricultural use these land areas needed
and best suited for agriculture.
      (2)   Prevent the indiscriminate spread of urban uses into rural areas
which are incompatible with agricultural pursuits, and which contribute to
their premature termination.
      (3)   Retain land which could eventually be developed for urban uses
currently in productive agricultural uses.
   (b)   Low Density Residential District (R-1). The Low Density Residential
District is created to provide for single-family residential uses at a density
of not more than two and nine-tenths (2.9) dwelling units per gross acre.
   (c)   Medium Density Residential District (R-2). The R-2 District is created
to provide for single-family and duplex residential uses at a density of not
more than four and three-tenths (4.3) dwelling units per gross acre.
   (d)   High Density Residential District (R-3). The R-3 District is created
to provide for single-family, two-family and multi-family residential uses.
This District may be used only when adequate public sewer and public water
services are available.
   (e)   Manufactured Home Park District (R-4). The District shall be used in
areas suitable for residential development. It will be limited to the
prefabricated types of single-family manufactured dwelling units and other uses
characteristic of a residential area.
   (f)   Neighborhood Business District (NB). The Neighborhood Business
District is created to provide for the retailing of convenience goods and
essential personal services to satisfy the daily and weekly household and
personal needs of the surrounding residential neighborhoods.
   (g)   General Business District (GB). The General Business District is
created to provide retailing and personal services which require larger tracts
of land and encompass a larger service area than that of the Neighborhood
Business District. This district is so designed to permit commercial
development of permitted uses which will be limited only by standards set forth
to protect the abutting districts and as directed against the extension of
strip zoning. The General Business District shall be considered for use in
limited areas adjacent to the Central Business District and in accessible
locations along primary through routes on the Major Thoroughfare Plan. Strip
zoning utilizing this district shall be prohibited.
   (h)   Central Business District (CB). It is the intention of Council that by
the creation of the Central Business District and its appurtenant regulations,
further expansion and renewal of the historical core business area will be
encouraged in such a manner that it is pleasant, convenient and efficient to
use.
   (i)   Professional Office Business District (POB). The Professional Office
Business District is designed to specifically provide for office development in
the Village of Elmore.
   (j)   Planned Business Park District (PBP). The purpose of the Planned
Business Park District is to encourage, in appropriate locations, the
development of a compatible mix of commercial, industrial, office and
institutional land uses, which will be characterized by a park-like openness
with attractive modern buildings set in an appropriate landscaped environment.
Businesses located therein shall be harmoniously integrated with each other and
be compatible to that portion of the municipality within which the Planned
Business Park is located. Area requirements of the District are designed to
promote the concentration of these desirable industries so that necessary
common facilities may be provided used in order that problems of utilities,
access, fire control, traffic control and other services may be more easily
solved.
   (k)   Light Industrial District (LI). The purpose of the Light Industrial
District is to encourage the development of manufacturing and wholesale
business establishments which are clean, quiet and free of hazardous or
objectionable elements such as noise, odor, dust, smoke, or glare, operate
entirely within enclosed structures and generate little industrial traffic.
This district is further designed to act as a transitional use between heavy
industrial uses and other less intensive business and residential uses.
   (l)   Heavy Industrial District (HI). The purpose of the Heavy Industrial
District is to encourage the development of major manufacturing, processing,
warehousing and major research and testing operations. These activities require
extensive community facilities, and reasonable access to primary through
routes. They may have extensive open storage and service areas, generate heavy
traffic, but shall be prohibited if they create nuisances beyond the
limitations set up by the Planning Commission. (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1111.03 SPECIAL DISTRICTS.
   Special districts are districts that are separately zoned and intended to
allow for and encourage types of development other than that normally
associated with conventional zoning districts. Table 1111-2 lists the special
districts.

Abbreviation Special Zoning District Name
REC          Recreation District
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1111.04 OVERLAY DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Intent. The intent of an overlay district is to establish regulations
in addition to the applicable regulations of the existing (underlying ) base
zoning district that either supplement or replace those existing regulations.
Overlay districts are applied to achieve zoning objectives within a defined
area when deemed necessary to address unique characteristics of that area.
   (b)   Planned Unit Development (PUD). A PUD is a floating overlay district
which generally does not appear on the zoning map until a designation is
requested. This is applied at the time a project is approved.
   (c)   Zoning Map Designation. The overlay district boundary shall be shown
on the zoning map as dashed lines and the district designation labeled is
placed alongside the base district designation, such as "R1-PUD."
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1111.05 ZONING MAPS.
   (a) The boundaries of the districts are hereby established as shown on a map
entitled Village of Elmore Zoning Map 2022, which map together with all
notations, amendments, references and other information shown thereon is hereby
made part of this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
   (b)   The Zoning Map presented to Council and the public for two (2) public
hearings is hereby adopted. (Ord. 39-23. Passed 1-23-23.)
1111.06 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the
districts shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
   (a)   Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the
center line of streets or highways, street lines or highway lines such
centerlines, street lines, or highway right-of-way lines shall be considered to
be such boundaries.
   (b)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
follow the lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
   (c)   Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately
parallel to the centerline or street lines of streets, or the center lines of
right-of-way lines of highways, such district boundaries shall be construed as
being parallel thereto and of such distance therefrom as indicated on the
zoning map. If no distance is given, such dimensions shall be determined by the
use of the scale shown on the zoning map.
   (d)   Where the boundary of a district follows a railroad line, such
boundary shall be deemed to be located midway between the main tracks of the
railroad line.
   (e)   Where the boundary of a district follows a stream, lake, or other body
of water, the boundary line of the body of water shall be deemed to be the
boundary of the zoning district unless otherwise indicated.
   (f)   In unsubdivided property, the district boundary lines on the map
accompanying and made a part of this Zoning Ordinance shall be determined by
dimension notes on the map, or by the use of the scale appearing on the map.
   (g)   Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated in the
manner authorized by law, the zoning district adjoining each side of such
street, alley or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of
such vacation, and all areas included in the vacation shall then and henceforth
be subject to all regulations of the extended district.
      (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1111.07 UNOFFICIAL ZONING MAP ONLINE.
   Zoning district information is available at the County Auditor's Website.
This information is deemed a reliable point of reference but is not guaranteed
and should be independently verified with the Village of Elmore.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1111.08 ZONING OF NEWLY ANNEXED AREAS.
   (a)   All land annexed to the Village subject to the adoption of this Zoning
Ordinance shall remain subject to the previous township zoning district
regulations until such time as the Official Zoning Map is amended according to
the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. All land annexed to the Village which,
prior to annexation, is not subject to township zoning shall remain unzoned
until the Official Zoning Map is amended according to the provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   In Ohio, the process of annexation is regulated by Ohio R.C. Chapter
709.

1113.01 APPLICABILITY.
   The Permitted Principal Use Table 1113-1 and Permitted Accessory Use Table
1113-2 lists the uses allowed within all zoning districts except for special
districts, planned unit developments, and overlay districts.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1113.02 EXPLANATION OF THE PERMITTED USE TABLES.
   This section provides an explanation of all the symbols and information
contained within the Permitted Principal Use Table 1113-1, and the Permitted
Accessory Use Table 1113-2 which identifies where and how uses are permitted
within the base zoning districts.
   (a)   [P] Permitted Uses. A "P" indicates that a use is permitted by right,
subject to compliance with all other applicable regulations of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (b)   [C] Conditional Permitted Uses. A "C" indicates that a use is allowed
only if reviewed and approved in accordance with the Conditional Use procedures
of Chapter
1161 "Conditional Use Review."
   (c)   Not Allowed. A blank cell (one with a "-" and does not contain a "P"
or "C") indicates that the listed use is not allowed in the respective zoning
district.
   (d)   Use Standards. The existence of use standards for a use category is
noted two ways:
      (1)   By a bracketed table note reference "[x]" within the table cell
containing the "P" or "C." Unless otherwise noted uses are also subject to
other applicable regulations of this Zoning Ordinance, and/or
      (2)   Uses may be subject to additional use-specific standards as
identified in the last column of Table 1113-1 and Table 1113-2. Unless
otherwise noted uses are also subject to other applicable regulations of this
Zoning Ordinance.
         (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1113.03 UNLISTED USES.
   When a proposed land use is not explicitly listed in the Permitted Principal
Use or Permitted Accessory Use Tables, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
determine whether or not it is included in the definition of a listed use or is
so consistent with the size, scale, operating characteristics and external
impacts of a listed use that it should be treated as the same use. Any such
interpretation shall be binding on future decisions of the Village. If no
similar use determination can be made, the Planning Commission or Village
Council may then determine if the zoning code should be amended to specifically
include the use.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1113.04 USE CATEGORIES.
   The use categories listed in the Permitted Principal Use Table 1113-1 are
organized into five major use groups: Agricultural; Residential; Public and
Institutional; Commercial; and Industrial. Each major use group is further
divided into a series of use categories. Table 1113-2 lists accessory use
categories. All of the use categories listed in the tables are defined in
Chapter
1171 "Definitions." (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)

1123.07    Cluster subdivision review procedure.
1123.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   The purpose of a cluster subdivision is to permit a reduction in lot
dimensions, yards, building setbacks and area requirements in order to achieve
a more useful pattern in open space and recreation areas accessible to the
majority of the living units; to achieve a more efficient use of land than is
generally derived through conventional development resulting in substantial
savings through shorter utilities and streets; to encourage a development
pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography and geologic features,
scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation, and prevents the disruption of
natural drainage patterns.
   (b)   To provide use, site development, and open space standards for the
Board of Zoning Appeals to follow in approving conditional use applications for
cluster subdivisions.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1123.02 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   Any application for a conditional use permit shall meet all of the following
conditions to qualify for consideration as a cluster subdivision for single-
family homes:
   (a)   Area. The cluster subdivision development site shall be not less than
five (5) acres in area; shall be under the control of one (1) owner or group of
owners; and shall be capable of being planned and developed as one (1) integral
unit.
   (b)   Location. The cluster subdivision development site shall be located
within the residential districts.
   (c)   Utilities. Public water and sewer facilities shall be available or
shall be provided as part of the development site in accordance with Part Nine,
Title Three "Utilities" of the Village of Elmore Codified Ordinances.
   (d)   Density. The proposed population density of the cluster subdivision
shall not exceed the requirements of the district in which it is located.
   (e)   Open Space. For each square foot of land gained through the reduction
or averaging of lot sizes, equal amounts of land shall be dedicated to the
Village or set aside as open space for the common use of the home or lot owners
within the cluster subdivision development under legal procedures so that there
are assurances that the required area shall remain open.
      (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1123.03 PERMITTED USES.
   The following uses of land and structures may be permitted within the
cluster subdivision developments:
   (a)   Single-family dwellings.
   (b)   Recreation and open space, provided that only the following land uses
may be set aside as common land for open space or recreational use under the
provisions of this chapter.

1139 "Parking, Access, and Mobility."
   (e)   Signs as provided in Chapter
1141 "Signs."
      (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1123.04 LOT SIZE VARIATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Lot Size. The lot size for cluster subdivision developments within a
R-R, R-1, R-2, R-3 Residential Districts may be averaged or reduced from those
sizes required by the applicable zoning district within which such development
is located by compliance with the following procedures:
      (1)   Site acreage computation: The gross acreage proposed for a cluster
subdivision development shall be computed to determine the total land area
available for development into lots under the minimum lot size requirements of
the applicable zoning district in which the proposed cluster subdivision
development is located.
      (2)   In arriving at a gross acreage figure, the following lands shall
not be considered as part of the gross acreage in computing the maximum number
of lots and/or dwelling units that may be created under this procedure: Land
use by public utilities as easements for major facilities, such as electric
transmission lines; sewer lines; water mains, or other similar lands which are
not available to the owner because of such easements.
   (b)   Maximum Number of Lots and Dwelling Units. After the total gross area
available for development has been determined by the above procedure, the
maximum number of lots and/or dwelling units that may be approved within the
subdivision development shall be computed by subtracting from the total gross
area available, a fixed percentage of such total for street right-of-way
purposes, and dividing the remaining net area available by the minimum lot area
requirement of the zoning district in which the cluster subdivision development
is located.
      (1)   The fixed percentages of street right-of-way purposes to be
subtracted from the total gross area available for development shall be twenty
percent (20%). This percentage shall apply regardless of the amount of land
actually required for street right-of-way.
      (2)   Under this procedure, individual lots may be reduced in area below
the minimum lot size required by the zone district in which the cluster
subdivision development is located, provided that the total number of dwelling
units and/or lots created within the development is not more than the maximum
number that would normally be allowed if the tract were developed under the
minimum lot area requirements of the applicable zone district in which it is
located.
   (c)   Permissive Minimum Lot Area. Notwithstanding other procedures set
forth in this chapter, lot sizes within cluster subdivisions shall not be
varied or reduced in area by more than thirty percent (30%) of the lot size
required in the zoned district in which it is located. The lot width shall not
be less than fifty-five (55) feet.
   (d)   Minimum Yard Requirements. Under the lot averaging or reduction
procedure, each lot shall have at least the following minimum yards:
      (1)   Front yard: Twenty-five (25) feet for all dwellings.
      (2)   Side yards: Six (6) feet on each side.
      (3)   Rear yards: Twenty-five (25) feet for all dwellings.
      (4)   Building height: Two and one-half (2 ½) stories, but not exceeding
thirty-five (35) feet. Accessory buildings shall not exceed a height of twenty
(20) feet.
         (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1123.05 OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
   For each square foot of land gained through the averaging or reduction of
lot sizes under the provisions of this chapter, equal amounts of land shall be
provided as open space. All open space, tree cover, recreational area, scenic
vista, or other authorized open land areas shall be either set aside as common
land for the sole benefit, use, and enjoyment of present and future lot or home
owners within the development, or may be dedicated to the Village as park land
for the use of the general public. The Planning Commission shall determine
which of these options is most appropriate and shall recommend to the Board of
Zoning Appeals one of the following procedures as part of its approval of a
conditional use permit for a cluster subdivision development:
   (a)   That open space land shall be conveyed by proper legal procedures from
the tract owner or owners to a home owners association or other similar non-
profit organizations so that fee simple title shall be vested in tract lot
owners as tenants in common, provided that suitable arrangements have been made
for the maintenance of such land and any buildings thereon, and provided
further, an open space easement for the land may be conveyed to the Village to
assure that open space land shall remain open.
   (b)   That open space land may be dedicated to the general public for park
or recreational purposes by the tract owner or owners, provided, that the
location and extent of such land conforms to the Future Land Use Plan for the
Village of Elmore, and provided further, that the access to and characteristics
of the land is such that it will be readily available to and desirable for
public use, development and maintenance. The owners or developers of the
cluster subdivision development shall not be compelled or required to improve
the natural condition of the open space lands before conveyance to the Village.
      (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1123.06 MAINTENANCE OF COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   The owner of the land shall be responsible for maintenance of all open space
set-aside areas unless dedicated to the Village. If open space set-aside areas
or other community facilities are not maintained in accordance with the final
subdivision plat(s), the Village shall cause such maintenance to be performed
and may assess the cost of such maintenance on those property owners
responsible for the maintenance of the open space.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1123.07 CLUSTER SUBDIVISION REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   (a)   A person, firm, or corporation desiring to create a cluster
subdivision shall apply to the Zoning Administrator for a conditional use
permit, and a certificate of compliance for such subdivision.
   (b)   The Zoning Administrator shall convey such plans and reports presented
by the applicant to the Village Planning Commission and the Board of Zoning
Appeals. The Planning Commission shall make a study and present its findings to
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (c)   Upon the receipt of the findings of the Village Planning Commission,
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall study the same and if concurring shall direct
the administrative official to issue the conditional use permit and the
application for the certificate of compliance to the applicant. Such
application for the certificate of compliance may contain conditions of
approval by the Board as it deems necessary in the best interest of the Village
and the certificate of compliance shall not be granted if such conditions are
not followed.

   (c)   Encouraging a sensitive design that respects the surrounding
established land use character and natural or man-made features of the site;
and
   (d)   Allowing deviations from certain zoning standards that would otherwise
apply if not contrary to the general spirit and intent of this Zoning
Ordinance.
      (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1125.02 INITIATION.
   Pursuant to Section

   PUDs may be approved in any base zoning district subject to the standards
set forth in Section
1125.07 "Minimum Eligibility Criteria" and the approval procedures set forth in
this chapter. (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1125.04 CONSOLIDATION WITH SUBDIVISION APPROVAL.
   For any PUD requiring subdivision plat approval, the subdivision plat may be
submitted simultaneously with the PUD development plan and reviewed
concurrently as part of the PUD.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1125.05 COUNCIL AUTHORITY.
   Village Council retains the legislative authority to determine whether PUD
zoning is appropriate regardless of whether the proposed development meets the
standards prescribed by this chapter. (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1125.06 SIZE.
   (a)   Each PUD shall contain a minimum of five (5) acres; provided sites
containing less than five (5) acres may be considered for rezoning to PUD. When
determining the appropriateness of areas less than the applicable minimum
required, the Village Council shall determine that:
      (1)   Rezoning the area to PUD will not result in a significant adverse
effect upon nearby or adjacent Village lands;
      (2)   The proposed uses will complement the character of the surrounding
area;
      (3)   The purpose and qualifying conditions of the PUD can be achieved
within a smaller area; and
      (4)   The PUD is not being used as a means to circumvent conventional
zoning requirements.
   
   (b)   The PUD process should not be used to address a nonconforming
situation for a lot that will be used for a single building and/or use where
the use is permitted but where such use does not comply with other applicable
standards. Such situations should first be considered for a variance
application. (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)

recognizable and substantial benefit to the ultimate users of the project and
to the community, where such benefit would otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely
to be achieved. Such benefit must otherwise be unfeasible or unlikely under the
regulations of the underlying or any other zoning district.
   (b)   Availability and Capacity of Public Services. The proposed type and
intensity of use shall not result in an unreasonable burden in the use of
existing public services, facilities, and utilities.
   (c)   Relationship to Existing Plans. The proposed development is consistent
with Village adopted plans, goals and policies.
   (d)   Compatibility with the PUD Purpose. The proposed development shall be
consistent with the intent and spirit of these regulations, as stated in
Section
1125.01 "Purpose."
   (e)   Economic Impact. The proposed development shall not impede the
continued use or development of surrounding properties for uses that are
permitted in the existing zoning district within which the PUD is proposed.
   (f)   Unified Control of Property. The proposed development shall be under
single ownership or control such that there is a single person or entity having
responsibility for completing the project in conformity with this Zoning
Ordinance and the specifications of the PUD development plan approval. This
provision shall not prohibit a transfer of ownership or control, upon due
notice to the Zoning Administrator. (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1125.08 PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   PUD Permitted Use List. Any use listed in Section
 1113.05 "Permitted or Conditionally Permitted Principal and Accessory Use
Tables" may potentially be permitted in a PUD. The uses must be identified in
the required PUD development plan, must not adversely affect the adjacent
property or the public health, safety and general welfare. The development plan
must either designate uses that will be allowed conditionally or as of right on
a parcel-by-parcel basis or by base zoning districts within the PUD.
   (b)   Residential Will be Predominant in R Districts. Where the existing
underlying base zoning district is residential, commercial and other
nonresidential uses may be permitted as part of a PUD which also contains a
residential component, provided that the applicant demonstrates that the
residential uses will be predominant. The Village Council after Planning
Commission recommendation shall determine predominance of use after taking into
account the following criteria as they apply to each of the proposed uses:
extent to which it serves residents in the PUD compared to others who travel to
the site; amount of traffic generated; hours of operation or use; noise, odors,
and overall impact on adjoining uses; land area allocated to each use; and
building area allocated to each use.
   (c)   Exceptions. If a proposed use is not consistent with an approved PUD
development plan, it shall not be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
the underlying zoning classification. (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1125.09 MODIFICATION OF MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   District regulations applicable to a land use in the PUD may be altered,
including but not limited to, modification from the lot area and width,
building setbacks, height, lot coverage, signs and parking. The applicant for a
PUD shall identify, in writing, all intended deviations from the zoning
requirements as part of the PUD development plan. Modifications may be approved
by the Village Council after Planning Commission recommendation. These
adjustments may be permitted only if they will result in a higher quality and
more sustainable development consistent with the purposes of a PUD expressed in
Section
1125.01 "Purpose."
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1125.10 DENSITY.
   (a)   The density for residential components of PUDs within an underlaying
residential district shall be the number of dwelling units per gross acre as
shown in Section
 1131.09 "Site Development Standards for Residential Districts," Table 1131-1.
   (b)   The density for residential components of PUDs within an underlying
Business district, except for the Central Business CB district, shall be the
number of dwelling units per gross acre for the Multi-family R-3 district in
Section
1131.09 "Site Development Standards for Residential Districts," Table 1131-1.
   (c)   The density for residential components of PUDs within an underlying
Central Business CB district shall be the number of dwelling units per gross
acre for the CB district in Section
1131.11 "Site Development Standards for Business and Industrial Districts,"
Table 1131-3.
   (d)   Where the PUD lies over multiple zoning districts, the number of
allowable units must be calculated separately for each underlying base zoning
district.
   (e)   Thus, the number of units that could be accommodated under the
requirements of Section
1125.10 "Density" above shall serve as the maximum number permitted for each
underlying base zoning district, unless a density bonus is approved in
accordance with Section
1125.11 "Density Bonus." There shall be no transfer of density between
different base zoning districts. (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1125.11 DENSITY BONUS.
   (a)   In addition to the in density allowed in Section
 1125.10 "Density" Village Council, after Planning Commission recommendation,
may permit an increase in the total number of residential units otherwise
allowed within a PUD under the following standards:   
      (1)   The appearance and construction will result in a development of
high quality, as evidenced by the innovative design and use of building
materials such as stone, masonry, and wood, but not including vinyl; a maximum
increase of five percent (5%) in the number of dwelling units may be approved.
      (2)   Significant natural features, including stands of mature trees,
will be preserved and/or substantial landscaping beyond the minimum
requirements will be incorporated into the development; a maximum increase of
five percent (5%) in the number of dwelling units may be approved.
      (3)   Decorative pavers or similar aesthetic enhancements will be
incorporated into the vehicular and pedestrian circulation system; a maximum
increase of five percent (5%) in the number of dwelling units may be approved.
      (4)   Removal or renovation of deteriorating buildings, sites or
contamination clean-up; a maximum increase of five percent (5%) in the number
of dwelling units may be approved.
   (b)   At the discretion of the Village Council, density may be increased up
to the maximum amount allowable within each category. However, the density in
the PUD may not exceed more than ten percent (10%) of the density which is
permitted in Section
 1125.10 "Density" of this chapter.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)

(20%) of the total land area of a PUD containing any residential units and not
less than ten percent (10%) of the total land area in non-residential
developments.
   (b)   All required open space areas shall be configured so the open space is
reasonably accessible to and usable by residents, visitors and other users of
the development. The minimum size of any individual open space area shall be
sufficient to achieve the visual and functional intent of the open space
provisions and not simply be a remnant piece of land. The open space shall
neither be perceived nor function simply as an extension of the rear yard of
those lots abutting it.
   (c)   If the site contains a river, stream or other body of water, the
Village may require that a portion of the required open space abuts the body of
water.
   (d)   All open space set-aside areas shall be owned and maintained jointly
or in common by the owners of the development through a recognized Homeowner's
or Property Owner's Association.
   (e)   For purposes of the PUD requirements, "common open space" is defined
as an area of land or water, or a combination of land and water, designed and
intended for the perpetual use and enjoyment of the users of the development
and/or the general public. Common open space may contain accessory structures
and improvements necessary or desirable for educational, noncommercial,
recreational or cultural uses.
   (f)   Areas Not Considered Open Space. The following land areas shall not be
counted as required open space for the purposes of this section.
      (1)   The area within any public street right-of-way or private street
easement.
      (2)   Storm water detention ponds; provided, rain gardens or ponds
designed as water features that may also provide for storm water storage may be

1125.14 MAINTENANCE OF COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   The owner of the land shall be responsible for maintenance of all open space
set-aside areas unless dedicated to the Village. If open space set-aside areas
or other community facilities are not maintained in accordance with the final
plat(s), or PUD development plan, the Village shall cause such maintenance to
be performed and may assess the cost of such maintenance on those property
owners subject responsible for the maintenance of the open space.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1125.15 CONNECTIVITY.
   Pathways for bicycles and pedestrians shall be incorporated throughout the
planned unit development and along all perimeter streets to ensure connectivity
between uses and with adjacent properties. Pathways and sidewalks shall be
constructed in accordance with the Village design standards. (Ord. 30-22.
Passed 12-12-22.)

CHAPTER 1133
Environmental Performance Standards
1133.01    Purpose.
1133.02    Applicability and compliance.
1133.03    Outdoor lighting.
1133.04    Noise.
1133.05    Vibration.
1133.06    Odors.
1133.07    Air quality/emissions.
1133.08    Hazardous material and waste handling.

1133.14    Enforcement.
1133.01 PURPOSE.
   Environmental performance standards are regulations which are intended to
promote a peaceful and quiet environment. Restrictions or limits are
established on uses or facilities whose environmental factors may create a
nuisance or cause a noxious, objectionable, or other undesirable effect on
persons or properties outside of the subject property. These restrictions apply
to a uses' construction as well as its operation. Materials and/or products of
a use shall be maintained in a method so that the health, safety, and welfare
of persons occupying the subject property or adjacent properties are not
jeopardized.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1133.02 APPLICABILITY AND COMPLIANCE.
   The Environmental Performance Standards are applicable to all land uses in
all zoning districts, unless specific districts are listed or specific uses are
exempted below. Both initial and continued compliance is required. Any
condition or land use falling under the jurisdiction of the standards of this
Zoning Ordinance at the time of its adoption and not in conformance with these
standards shall be brought in full compliance immediately upon discontinuance
of the existing use of land, structure or building. Any change in the principal
use of land, structure or building shall constitute discontinuance and be fully
subject to these standards and provisions.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1133.03 OUTDOOR LIGHTING.
   (a)   Applicability. Except as described below, all outdoor lighting shall
comply with these requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, new
lighting, replacement lighting, or any other lighting whether attached to
structures, poles, the earth, or any other location, including lighting
installed by any third party.
      (1)   Lighting related to single-family and two-family dwellings are
exempt; however, all lighting for these uses shall be shielded and arranged to
reduce glare and to reflect light away from all adjacent property, public roads
and highways.
      (2)   Seasonally decorative outdoor lighting is exempt from the
requirements of this section.
      (3)   Lighting for certain outdoor recreational uses because of their
unique requirements for nighttime visibility and their limited hours of
operation are exempt from the requirements of this section. Example of such
uses are high school football night games, lighted tennis courts and baseball
diamonds.
      (4)   Lighting required by the federal, state or local law shall be
exempted from the standards of this section.
   (b)   Exterior Lighting Plan. A lighting plan is required for all uses that
are required to file a site plan and shall be approved according to the
procedures set forth in Chapter
1157 "Site Plan Review." The lighting plan shall demonstrate compliance with
the requirements of this section. However, a photometric study of the
illumination shall only be required when a multi-family dwelling or a
nonresidential use is proposed to be located adjacent to a lot in a residential
district or that is occupied by an existing residential use.
   (c)   Outdoor Lighting Standards.
      (1)   Glare Reduction.
         A.   All on-site lighting of buildings, lawns, parking areas and signs
shall be shielded and arranged to reduce glare and to reflect light away from
all adjacent property, public roads and highways.

Figure 1133-A: Illustration of shielded lighting.
         B.   No outdoor lighting shall be of such an intensity or color
distortion as to cause glare or to impair the vision of drivers or pedestrians.
      (2)   Canopy Shielding. Any canopy structure used at a business location
(i.e., for uses such as vehicle service stations and drive-through facilities)
must have recessed ceiling fixtures which do not extend below the surface of
the canopy.
      (3)   Building Ornamentation and Accentuation. Utilization of lighting to
accentuate key architectural elements of a building or development is permitted
provided that:
         A.   In no case shall such lighting flash or blink intermittently.
         B.   Any such lighting source located on the side of a building that
faces an adjoining residential use or residential district shall be effectively
screened from view of the residential use or residential district.
   (d)   Illumination Standards and Measurement.
      (1)   Standard. There shall be a maximum illumination of 0.5 footcandles
at the lot line in all residential districts and for any nonresidential use
that abuts a lot in a residential zoning district or lot occupied by an
existing residential use.
      (2)   Measurement. Light levels shall be measured in foot-candles with a
direct reading, portable light meter. Readings shall be taken only after the
cell has been exposed long enough to take a constant reading. Measurements
shall be taken at the property line, along a horizontal plane at a height of
three and one-half (3.5) feet above the ground.
         (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1133.04 NOISE.
   All uses shall comply with the following noise standards.
   (a)   A sound-level meter shall be used to measure decibel level.
   (b)   Noise levels shall be measured at the lot line.

1135.05 BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS FOR NONRESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Applicability. The standards of this subsection shall apply to all
non-residential structures in the Residential and Business Zoning Districts.
   (b)   General Nonresidential Building Requirements.
      (1)   Building Orientation. Buildings shall be parallel to the street
they front unless an alternate orientation is consistent with existing adjacent
development.
      (2)   Primary Entrances. The primary entrances of buildings shall be
oriented:
         A.   Towards a street along the perimeter of the development; or
         B.   Towards streets or roadways in the interior of the development if
none of the building's facades has frontage on a public street; or
         C.   As approved under the site plan review provisions of Chapter
1157 "Site Plan Review."
      (3)   General Building Façade Requirements. Building facades shall comply
with the following standards.
         A.   Blank building walls facing streets are prohibited;
         B.   Rear and side facades, if visible from public streets, shall have
a similar architectural treatment as utilized on the primary or front façade;
and
         C.   These requirements shall not apply to those walls that are not
visible from a street and only visible from an alley, or the rear yard of
another nonresidential site.
   (c)   Unified Theme. Where there are multiple buildings within a single
development, the architectural design of buildings, including freestanding
outparcel structures, should be organized around a consistent architectural
theme in terms of the character, materials, texture, color, and scale of
buildings. Themed restaurants, retail chains, and other franchise-style
structures should adjust some aspects of their standard architectural model to
be consistent with a development's architectural character.
   (d)   Infill Development. All new development or redevelopment shall be
compatible with the established architectural character of the surrounding area
utilizing a building design and style that is complementary to the surrounding
uses and structures. Compatibility may be achieved through the repetition of
similar rooflines, similar proportions in relation to height, size, scale and
mass, similar door and window patterns, building materials and color, and
building orientation.
   (e)   Building Transparency. Building elevations that are visible from a
public street should dedicate a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of the
length of the front façade to windows or transparent entrances.
   (f)   Design of Façades.
      (1)   Offset Required. Front façades sixty (60) feet wide or wider shall
incorporate wall offsets of at least two (2) feet in depth (projections or
recesses) a minimum of every forty (40) feet. Each required offset shall have a
minimum width of twenty (20) feet.
      (2)   Offset Alternatives. The following alternatives can be used in
place of the required front façade offsets:
         A.   Façade color changes following the same dimensional standards as
the offset requirements;
         B.   Pilasters having a minimum depth of one (1) foot, a minimum width
of one (1) foot, and a minimum height of eighty percent (80%) of the façade's
height; and/or
         C.   Roofline changes when coupled with correspondingly aligned façade
material changes.

      (1)   In cases where vegetative materials are used for screening in
accordance with this subsection, the vegetative materials shall:
         A.   Be planted around the perimeter of the site feature to be
screened in a manner that screens the site feature from all off-site views;
         B.   Be configured in two (2) staggered rows or other arrangement that
provides maximum screening;
         C.   Be upright, large evergreen shrubs or hedge sand capable of
reaching at least six (6) feet in height within three (3) years of planting;
and
         D.   Be spaced no farther than three (3) feet on-center.
      (2)   All sides of the feature shall be screened with the exception that
one (1) side of the feature may be screened with a gate or other similar
feature to allow access while screening the feature when access is not
necessary.
         (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1137.13 MAINTENANCE.
   (a)   The owner of the property shall be responsible for the continued

proper, neat and orderly appearance, free from refuse, debris, and weeds at all
times.
   (b)   All screening shall be kept free of advertising or other signs, except
for directional signs and other signs for the efficient flow of vehicles.
   (c)   All unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced within one
year, or by the next planting period, whichever comes first.

(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1137.14 MODIFICATIONS TO LANDSCAPE REQUIREMENTS.
   In consideration of the overall design and impact of a specific landscape
plan, and in consideration of the amount of existing plant material to be
retained on the site, the specific requirements outlined in this chapter may be
modified, provided that any such adjustment is in keeping with the intent of
this chapter and Zoning Ordinance in general. In determining whether a
modification is appropriate, the approval authority shall consider whether the
following conditions exist:
   (a)   Topographic features or other unique features of the site create
conditions such that strict application of the landscape regulations would
result in a less effective screen than an alternative landscape design.
   (b)   Parking, vehicular circulation, or land use are such that required
landscaping would not enhance the site or result in the desired screening
effect.
   (c)   The public benefit intended by the landscape regulations could be
better-achieved with a plan that varies from the strict requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance.

1139.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that uses have a minimum level of
off-street parking to avoid congestion on surrounding streets, promote greater
safety of passage between highway and land, minimize the detrimental effects of
off-street parking areas on adjacent properties, and establish provisions for
stacking, loading and access control.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1139.02 APPLICABILITY.
   No building or structure shall be erected, substantially altered, or its use
changed unless permanently maintained off-street parking and loading spaces
have been provided in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (a)   Existing Buildings. The provisions of this chapter, except where there
is a change of use, shall not apply to any existing building or structure.
   (b)   Change in Permitted Use. A permitted use that does not meet the
parking requirements of this chapter may be converted to another permitted use
without full compliance with the required number of parking spaces provided:
      (1)   The applicant provides the maximum amount of parking, loading, or
stacking spaces possible without being required to remove or partially remove a
structure or required landscaping or buffers.
      (2)   If a structure or a portion of a structure is voluntarily removed,
the resulting area shall be used to provide the additional parking, loading, or
stacking spaces necessary towards fulfilling the minimum requirements of this
chapter.
   (c)   Expansions and Enlargements. Structures enlarged so as to increase the
floor area, seating capacity, dwelling units, or otherwise increasing the unit
of measurement used to determine the number of required parking spaces by more
than twenty-five percent (25%) shall provide additional off-street parking
spaces necessary for the enlargement, but shall not be required to remove any
pre-existing parking deficit for the structure and use prior to the
enlargement.
   (d)   Downtown Parking Exemption. Parking is not required in the Central
Business District (CB) zoning district except for the following uses:
dwellings, and lodging.
      (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1139.03 PARKING LOT PLAN REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Whenever six or more vehicles are required for a given use under the
requirements of this chapter, plans and specifications for the construction or
alteration of an off-street parking area shall be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator before a zoning permit can be issued. Such plans and
specifications shall show the location, basis and capacity calculation, size,
site design, surfacing, marking, lighting, drainage, curb cuts, entrances,
exits, and any other detailed features essential to the complete design and
construction of the parking area.
   (b)   A separate plan is not required if the parking lot plan is being
submitted as part of a site plan under Chapter
1157 "Site Plan Review."
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1139.04 REQUIRED PARKING SPACES.
   (a)   The following rules shall apply when computing parking spaces:
      (1)   On-Street Parking. On-street parking spaces shall not be counted
toward off-street parking space requirements except as may otherwise be
provided for in this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Driveway Space Meeting Parking Requirements. Entrances, exits, or
driveways shall not be computed as any part of a required parking lot or area,
except in the case of single-family or two-family dwellings where driveways may
be used in calculating the amount of off-street parking.
      (3)   Multiple Uses. Where a building or group of buildings on the same
lot contains two (2) or more uses, the parking areas shall include a number of
spaces that equals the combined total of parking spaces required for each
individual use, except as otherwise allowed in this chapter.
      (4)   Area Measurements. All square footage-based parking standards shall
be computed on the basis of gross floor area of all floors in the building.
      (5)   Bench Seating. In the case of benches, pews, and similar seating
accommodations that do not have individual seats, each twenty-four (24) inches
of length of seating shall be counted as one (1) seat for the purpose of
determining the parking requirements.
      (6)   Electric Vehicle Charging Station Spaces. Parking spaces that are
restricted or otherwise dedicated to and provided with equipment solely for the
purpose of charging electric vehicles shall count towards the total number of
required off-street parking spaces on a space for space basis where required.
Such parking spaces shall meet all other code requirements.
      (7)   Parking Areas within a Structure. No parking spaces located within
the interior of a structure (excluding parking garages) shall be counted in
meeting the off-street parking requirements of this section except when located
within a private garage, parking garage, or other facility designed for the
parking of cars.
      (8)   Accessory and Temporary Uses. Accessory and temporary uses shall be
exempt from off-street parking requirements unless specifically required in
Section
1115.34 "Temporary Uses Not Listed."
      (9)   Unlisted Uses. Upon receiving an application for a use not
specifically listed or addressed in Table 1139-1 in Section
1139.04 "Required Parking Spaces," the Zoning Administrator shall apply the
parking standard specified for the listed use that the Zoning Administrator
deems most similar to the proposed use in regard to use, size and intensity of
use. If the Zoning Administrator determines that there is no listed use similar
to the proposed use, intensity, or size, the Zoning Administrator may refer to
the estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the American
Planning Association (APA), the Urban Land Institute (ULI) and/or the Institute
of Traffic Engineers (ITE). The Zoning Administrator's decision regarding
parking requirements for a specific use is appealable to the Board of Zoning
Appeals as established in Section
1163.01 "Appeals."
   (b)   Number Of Spaces Required.
      (1)   This section defines the number of parking spaces required for each
use within the Village.
      (2)   Additional reductions shall be permitted if the applicant provides
off-site parking spaces, shared parking spaces, or deferred construction
parking spaces as provided for in Section
1139.06 "Alternative Parking Provisions."

1139.05 LOCATION OF PARKING SPACES.
   The following regulations shall govern the location of off-street parking
spaces and areas:
   (a)   Parking spaces for all detached residential uses shall be located on
the same lot as the use which they are intended to serve.
   (b)   Parking spaces for commercial, industrial, or institutional uses shall
be located not more than 300 feet from the principal use.
   (c)   Parking spaces for apartments, dormitories, or similar residential
uses shall be located not more than 300 feet from the principal use.
   (d)   Private Garage Rental Exception. Not more than one (1) space is rented
for parking to persons not residents on the premises.
      (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1139.06 ALTERNATIVE PARKING PROVISIONS.
   The following are optional methods of accommodating parking as an
alternative to constructing an adequate number of parking spaces on an
individual lot pursuant to this chapter. The use of one of these alternatives
shall require review and approval under Chapter
1157 "Site Plan Review."
   (a)   Reduction of Required Parking for Joint Use of Parking Spaces.
      (1)   A reduction in the total number of required off-street parking
spaces for two (2) or more uses jointly providing parking facilities may be
approved when their respective hours of need of maximum parking do not normally
overlap, provided that the developer submits sufficient data to demonstrate
that the hours of maximum demand for parking at the respective uses do not
normally overlap. The required spaces assigned to one use may not be assigned
to another use at the same time.
      (2)   No joint parking area shall be located in a residential district.
   (b)   Deferred Parking Reduction for Elderly and Disabled Housing. Reduce
the parking for dwelling units restricted for the elderly and disabled to one
(1) space per unit plus an area on the site reserved for future parking to
accommodate one (1) additional space per dwelling unit. This provision is
intended only for new developments and projects that involve major remodeling.
   (c)   Additional Reductions in Parking. A reduction in the required number
of parking spaces may be allowed if the applicant submits a parking demand
study, prepared by a qualified parking or traffic consultant, substantiating
the basis for granting a reduced number of spaces.
      (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1139.07 PARKING DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The following standards shall apply to the design and construction of off-

Each additional 100,000       1
      (2)   The requirements of Table 1139-4 "Off-Street Loading Requirements"
may be reduced or waived during site plan review and approval under Chapter
1157 "Site Plan Review" based on documentation from the applicant demonstrating
that due to the specific uses, the number of loading spaces is not required.
   (c)   Location.
      (1)   All loading spaces shall be set back a minimum of fifty (50) feet
from all residential lot lines unless completely enclosed by building walls, a
uniformly painted solid fence or wall, or any combination thereof, that has a

sidewalk along all public streets for the full length of street frontage.
      (3)   All sidewalks shall meet the sidewalk specifications of the
Village.
      (4)   Sidewalks shall be maintained in good condition in accordance with
Chapter
901 "Sidewalks" of the Elmore Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   Walkway Connections to Public Sidewalks.
      (1)   There shall be one (1) internal continuous walkway of at least four
(4) feet in width that provides a direct connection from the public street to
the primary customer entrance or to the sidewalk along a multi-tenant building.

part as part of the site plan review process. (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1139.17 TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of a Traffic Impact Study (TIS) is to provide
information to the Village to allow for an assessment of the impact major
development projects will have on the Village's transportation network. The
study provides guidance for site access, on-site circulation, parking, and off-
site improvements necessary to permit the street system to operate at a
satisfactory level of service.
   (b)   Applicability. A TIS for a proposed development shall be submitted
with the site plan, preliminary plat, or PUD plan when the development meets
any of the following criteria:
      (1)   The proposed development generates 100 or more added new peak hour
trips to and/or from the site during the adjacent roadway's peak hours or
during the development's peak hour, and the proposed development generates more
than 1,000 trips daily.
      (2)   The Village Administrator determines that other conditions exist in
the vicinity of the proposed development that may be negatively impacted by the
development. Final determination of such conditions shall be determined by the
Village Administrator.
      (3)   The Village Administrator may waive the requirement for a TIS based
on his or her initial review of the proposed use and information available on
the streets adjacent to the subject property.
         (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1139.18 TRAFFIC ACCESS MANAGEMENT.
   (a)   Purpose. Control over the number and location of access points, as
specified in this section, along the Village's major roadways is necessary to
reduce congestion, improve safety, maintain acceptable flow and minimize
confusion.
   (b)   Applicability.
      (1)   The standards of this section shall apply to all development having
frontage on and direct access to any primary through route or primary local
street within the Village of Elmore.
      (2)   Single-family and two-family residential uses and development in
the Central Business (CB) District shall be exempt from the provisions of this
section.
   (c)   Driveway Spacing, Same Side of Street. 
      (1)   Each parcel shall have not more than two (2) access drives from
each abutting street unless otherwise permitted below. This may be reduced to
one (1) access drive during the site plan review process when it is in the
interest of good traffic operation.
      (2)   One (1) additional access drive may be permitted for lots that have
200 or more feet of frontage on one (1) street.
      (3)   An additional access drive for lots that have more than 500 feet of
frontage may be permitted during the site plan review process when it is in the
interest of good traffic operation.
      (4)   Curb cuts on corner lots must be set back the maximum distance
feasible from the adjacent intersections.
      (5)   Insofar as practical, the use of common drives by two (2) or more
uses shall be encouraged to reduce the number of such access points.
   (d)   Driveway Spacing, Opposite Side of Street.  In order to prevent
conflicting left-turn movements, connections on opposite sides of primary
through routes or primary local streets shall be directly opposite each other
or offset by a distance of a minimum of 150 feet, The spacing shall be measured
from edge of pavement to edge of pavement between the two closest edges of the
driveways. See Figure 1139-C Illustrative Driveway Spacing.

Figure 1139-C: Illustrative Driveway Spacing
   (e)   Review of Access Control. In reviewing site plans which involve the
creation, or substantially increased utilization of, commercial driveways
access points onto primary through routes and primary local streets, the
following may be required as part of the site plan review process:
      (1)   Provision of Reserved Turning Lanes. At those access points where
the Village determines, after Village Administrator review and recommendation,
that vehicles turning to and from the primary through routes and primary local
streets will have a substantially negative effect on the roadway capacity,
reserved turn lanes shall be constructed by the developer.
      (2)   Provision of Frontage Road. When deemed needed and feasible, after
Village Administrator review and recommendation, the Village may require the
construction of a frontage road. However, access to the primary through routes
or primary local streets via an intersecting street or a common driveway shall
be investigated if such a design is not reasonable.
   (f)   Modification of Requirements. Given the variation in existing physical
conditions along the Village's streets, modifications to the spacing and other
requirements above may be permitted as part of the site plan review.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)

development, and preserve the scenic and natural beauty of designated areas. It
is also the intent, through the provisions herein, to give recognition to the
legitimate needs of businesses, industry, and other activities in attaining
their identification and informational objectives. Similarly, these sign
regulations will help protect the character of the Village's residential
neighborhoods by discouraging encroachment of signage that undermines the
intended character of these areas. It is further intended to have these sign
regulations reduce sign clutter, distractions and obstructions that may
contribute to traffic accidents and the elimination of safety hazards that may

changes reduce the degree of nonconformity.

placed, or altered on any property prior to receipt of a required permit, a
fine of not more than one-hundred dollars ($100.00) shall be imposed. Each day
such violation continues after receipt of a violation notice, shall be
considered a separate offense.

CHAPTER 1163
Appeals and Variances
1163.01    Appeals.
1163.02    Variances.
1163.03    Public hearing by the Board for appeals and variances.
1163.04    Appeal of Board of Zoning Appeals decisions.
1163.01 APPEALS.
   (a)   Purpose. This section allows any person aggrieved by an administrative
decision during the administration or enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance the
opportunity to have the Board of Zoning Appeals review that decision. The Board
shall determine whether or not the decision was in conformance with this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (b)   Applicability and Initiation.
      (1)   Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals concerning interpretation or
administration of the Zoning Ordinance may be taken by any person aggrieved or
by any officer or bureau of the legislative authority of the Village affected
by any administrative decision by the Planning Commission, Zoning
Administrator, or any other administrative staff given the authority to make a
decision as authorized by this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   An appeal may not be made to the Board when the Planning Commission
is making a recommendation to Village Council as part of a legislative action
such as a code text, a map amendment, or a PUD.
   (c)   Appeal Procedure.
      (1)   Submission of Appeal. Such appeal shall be taken within twenty (20)
days after the decision by filing with the Zoning Administrator, a written
notice of appeal specifying the ground upon which the appeal is being taken.
      (2)   Forwarding of the Record to the Board. The Zoning Administrator
shall transmit all the papers, documents, and other materials related to the
appealed decision or determination to the Board of Zoning Appeals. This
material shall constitute the record of the appeal.
   (d)   Review Criteria for Appeals. A decision or determination shall not be
reversed or modified unless there is competent, material, and substantial
evidence in the record that the decision or determination fails to comply with
either the procedural or substantive requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)   Fees. A fee and costs as established by Section
1153.17 "Fees and Costs."
   (f)   Stay of Proceedings. A properly submitted appeal shall stay all
administrative proceedings by the Village in furtherance of the action
appealed, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board of Zoning
Appeals that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which
case the administrative proceedings shall not be stayed unless a restraining
order is granted by the Board or by a court of competent jurisdiction, for good
cause shown.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1163.02 VARIANCES.
   (a)   Authority and Intent.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific
cases such variances from the terms of the Zoning Ordinance as will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance would result in
unnecessary hardship. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or
buildings in the same district or permitted or non-conforming use of lands,
structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for
issuance of a variance.
      (2)   It is not intended that variances be granted merely to remove
inconveniences or financial burdens that the requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance may impose of property owners in general. Variances are intended to
address extraordinary, exceptional, or unique situations that were not caused
by the applicant's act or omission.
   (b)   Initiation. Pursuant to Section
1153.03 "Authority to File Applications," any person having authority to file
applications may initiate an application for a variance.
   (c)   Application. A variance from the terms of the Zoning Ordinance shall
not be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless and until a written
application for a variance is submitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals through
the Zoning Administrator. The application shall contain the following
information as a minimum:
      (1)   Name, address, and phone number of applicant;
      (2)   Legal description of property and a survey of the property in
question by a person licensed in the State of Ohio to perform land surveys as
may be required by the Zoning Administrator;
      (3)   Description of nature of variance requested;
      (4)   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to the factors set forth in Subsection
1163.02(d) "Factors to be Considered for Variances," items (1) through (9);
      (5)   The signature of the owner or applicant attesting to the truth and
exactness of all information supplied by the application; and
      (6)   A fee as established in Section
1153.17 "Fees and Costs."
   (d)   Factors to be Considered for Variances. The following factors shall be
considered and weighed by the Board of Zoning Appeals to determine practical
difficulty:
      (1)   Exceptional Circumstances. Whether special conditions and
circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building
involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings
in the same district; examples of such special conditions or circumstances are:
exceptional irregularity, narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or
adjacency to nonconforming and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions.
That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and that authorization of a variance is,
therefore, necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
      (2)   Preservation of Property Rights. That a literal interpretation of
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights
commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of
the Zoning Ordinance and that the granting of such variance will not be
injurious to persons working or residing in the neighborhood.
      (3)   Not Due to Applicant Actions. That special conditions and
circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant and not solely
based on showing that the property could be put to better economic use than
presently permitted by zoning regulations. Such theoretical loss or limited
possibilities of economic advantage shall not be considered real hardships.
      (4)   Not Confer Special Privilege. That granting the variance requested
will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by the
Zoning Ordinance, to other land, structures, or buildings in the same district.
      (5)   Absence of Detriment. That the authorizing of such variance will
not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property, and will not be contrary
to the public interest (health, safety) or the intent and purpose of this
Zoning Ordinance and other adopted plans.
      (6)   No Change in Use. That such variance may not be construed to mean a
change of use but shall mean only a variation or modification from the strict
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (7)   Not of General Nature. That the condition or situation of the
subject property, or the intended use of the property, for which variance is
sought, is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably
practical the formulation of a general regulations for such conditions or
situation.
      (8)   Minimum Modification. That such variance, if granted, is the
minimum modification that will make possible the reasonable use of the land,
building or structure.
      (9)   That in no instance shall a variance be considered for the
following reasons:
         A.   Presence of nonconformities in the zoning district.
         B.   Previous variances granted in the zoning district.
         C.   Uses in adjoining zoning districts.
         D.   The applicant's belief that the intended use would be permitted
upon his or her purchase of the land.
         E.   Hardship being demonstrated beyond the context of zoning e.g.,
economics.
   (e)   Variations to Nonconforming Uses and Buildings.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have no powers to authorize
through a variance, the establishment of a nonconforming use of land or
buildings.
      (2)   The substitution of a nonconforming use existing at the time of
enactment of this Zoning Ordinance for another nonconforming use shall be
allowed provided no structural alterations are made except those required by
law or ordinance. See Chapter
1165 "Nonconforming Uses."
      (3)   The Board shall adhere to all regulations contained in Chapter 1165
"Nonconforming Uses," in acting upon all nonconforming uses and modifications
thereto.
   (f)   Conditions Imposed by the Board. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall
have the power to impose additional conditions and safeguards other than those
stated in the Zoning Ordinance when granting variances. Such additional
conditions shall be reasonable and necessary to promote and preserve the public
safety, general welfare and economic viability of the neighborhood and
community and shall be imposed solely for the purpose of minimizing the effect
of the variance on surrounding property and the community as a whole.
Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning
Ordinance and punishable under Section
1167.99 "Penalty."
   (g)   Lapses of Variances.
      (1)   A variance, once granted, shall not be withdrawn or changed unless
there is a change of circumstances, or if, after the expiration of twelve (12)
months, no construction has taken place in accordance with the terms and
conditions for which such variance was granted. The Zoning Administrator shall
give a notice in writing, and thirty (30) days thereafter the variance shall be
deemed null and void and all regulations governing such premises in question
shall revert to those in effect before the variance was granted.
      (2)   However, a variance may be renewed annually by the original
applicant or any successor in interest including a conveyee if prior to the
expiration of the thirty (30) day notice, he/she notifies the Board of Zoning
Appeals in writing of his/her intention to continue the terms of the variance.
There shall be no limitation on the number of annual renewals. The Zoning
Administrator shall continue the notification procedure annually.
         (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1163.03 PUBLIC HEARING BY THE BOARD FOR APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Schedule. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hold a public hearing
within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an application for an appeal or
variance from the Zoning Administrator or an applicant.
   (b)   Notice of Public Hearing in Newspaper. Before holding the public
hearing, notice of such hearing shall be placed in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the Village at least ten (10) days before the date of
such hearing. The notice shall set forth the time and place of the public
hearing, and the nature of the proposed appeal or variance in accordance with
Section
1153.09 "Public Notification for Public Hearings."
   (c)   Notice to Parties of Interest. Before holding the public hearing,
notice of such hearing shall be mailed, by first class mail, at least ten (10)
days before the day of the hearing to the applicant and all owners of property
within, contiguous to, and directly across the street from such area proposed
for the appeal or variance to the address of such owners appearing on the
County Auditor's current tax list. The notices shall contain the same
information as required of notices published in newspapers as specified in this
Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)   Board of Zoning Appeals Review and Decision.
      (1)   For Appeals. Within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as is
reasonable, following the required public hearing, The Board may reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements, decision, or
determination of the administrative decision as in its opinion ought to be
made. The decision shall state any conditions and safeguards necessary to
protect the public interest.
      (2)   For Variances. Within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as is
reasonable, following the required public hearing, the Board shall either
approve, approve with supplementary conditions, or disapprove the request for a
variance.

Board.
         (Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1163.04 APPEAL OF BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS DECISIONS.
   (a)   It is the intent of this chapter that all questions of interpretation
and enforcement shall first be presented to the Zoning Administrator, and that
such questions shall be presented to the Board of Zoning Appeals only on appeal
from the decision of the Zoning Administrator, and that recourse from the
decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be to the courts as provided by
Subsection
1163.04(d) below, and Ohio R.C. Chapter 713.
   
   (b)   It is further the intent of this chapter that the duties of the
Council in connection with this chapter shall not include hearing and deciding
questions of interpretation and enforcement that may arise; these being the
powers of the Board of Zoning Appeals. Under this chapter, Council shall have
only duties of considering, adopting, or rejecting proposed amendments or the
repeal of all or part of the Zoning Ordinance, as provided by law and of
establishing a schedule of fees and charges.
   (c)   If, in the course of carrying out the intent of this chapter and after
review of all appeal cases brought before it, the Board of Zoning Appeals finds
a series of similar irregularities or inequities, it shall be incumbent upon
the Board of Zoning Appeals to inform Council and the Planning Commission of
these inadequacies in order that the Zoning Ordinance or map may be
appropriately amended.
   (d)   A person aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may
appeal to the Court of Common Pleas.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
CHAPTER 1165
Nonconforming Uses
1165.01    Purpose.

   In the provisions established by this Zoning Ordinance, there exists lots,
uses of land, structures and uses of structures, and land in combination which
were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be
prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance after
adoption or amendment thereto. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to
regulate the continued existence of those uses, structures, and lots that do
not conform to the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, or any future
amendments.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1165.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Passage of this Zoning Ordinance in no way legalizes any illegal uses
existing at the time of its adoption.
   (b)   The governmental acquisition of a portion of a lot for a public
purpose that results in reduction in a required yard of building setback below
that required in the applicable zoning district shall not render a structure
nonconforming.
   (c)   The change in ownership of a nonconforming building, structure, use or
lot of record does not, in itself, require the nonconformity to be corrected.
   (d)   An applicant for any development review procedure that deals with a
nonconformity shall bear the burden of proof in demonstrating that the use was
a legal nonconformity on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)   Any use, building, structure, land or premises that existed at the
time of the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance that was legally
established under a previous Zoning Ordinance amendment or versions may be
continued even if such use, building, structure, or use of land does not
conform to the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (f)   The requirements of this chapter shall not apply to a development
standard or feature that is the subject of an approved variance, waiver, or
modification of standards in a Cluster Subdivision or PUD. Where a variance,
waiver, or modification has been granted for a development standard or feature
that does not otherwise conform to the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance,
that development standard or feature shall be deemed conforming.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1165.03 NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS.

regulations, whether by original adoption or by subsequent amendment, may be
continued after such adoption or amendment, under the conditions specified in
this section.
   (b)   The addition to enlargement or expansion of any such nonconforming
building may be permitted provided such addition, enlargement or expansion
complies with all height, area, parking, setback and other requirements of the
district in which it is located.
   (c)   A nonconforming building or structure which is damaged or partially
destroyed by fire, flood, wind, earthquake or other calamity, or the public
enemy, may be restored and the same use and occupancy continued or resumed,
provided that such restoration is started within a period of one (1) year and
it is diligently pursued to completion. Any lot whose buildings are destroyed
beyond ninety percent (90%) of their total value shall not be restored to its
original use and the land used by such buildings shall thereafter be used in
conformance with the district regulations.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1165.04 NONCONFORMING USE OF A BUILDING.
   (a)   The nonconforming use of a building may be changed to a use of the
same or more restricted classifications but shall not thereafter be changed
back to a less restrictive use.
   (b)   No such building shall be enlarged or expanded to increase the
nonconforming use. No additional structures shall be constructed in connection
with such nonconforming use, except as follows:
      (1)   The construction of a detached accessory structure related to a
nonconforming residential use shall be permitted subject to complying with the
accessory use lot coverage and setback regulations of the zoning district in
which the nonconforming residential use is located.
      (2)   For nonconforming residential uses, non-habitable attached garages,
porches and decks, although requiring a zoning permit and certificate of
compliance, shall not be considered expansions of non-conforming uses. Such
additions to nonconforming residential uses shall comply with the lot coverage
and setback requirements of the zoning district in which the nonconforming
residential use is located.
   (c)   A nonconforming use of the building, or portion thereof, which is
discontinued for a period of two (2) years or more, shall not thereafter be
occupied except by a use which conforms to the use regulations of the district
in which it is located.

any other portion of the lot or adjoining property.
   (c)   A nonconforming use of the land or buildings may be changed to a use
of the same or more restricted classifications but shall not thereafter be
changed back to a less restrictive use.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1165.06 NONCONFORMING REGULATIONS.
   Any conforming or nonconforming use, that does not conform to the
regulations this Zoning Ordinance pertaining to yard requirements, lot
requirements, off-street parking, height regulations and other regulations,
shall be permitted to continue under such nonconforming condition; except that
any enlargement, change of use or addition shall not cause the aggregate use to
violate the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance beyond such existing
nonconformance which exists at the time of adoption of this Zoning Ordinance or
any subsequent amendment.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1165.07 EXISTING USE RECLASSIFIED AS A CONDITIONAL USE.
   In the event an existing use that was permitted by right at the time the use
was established is thereafter reclassified as a conditional use in the
applicable district due to a zoning text amendment, such use shall be
considered to be an approved conditional use without any further action.
However, any subsequent change to such use shall require review and approval by
the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with this chapter and Chapter
1161 "Conditional Use Review." Such use, provided it is conditionally permitted
in the applicable district, shall not be considered a nonconforming use.
(Ord. 30-22. Passed 12-12-22.)
1165.08 NONCONFORMANCE AS TO LOT AREA, WIDTH AND DEPTH.
   Any lot of record, existing at the time of adoption of this Zoning
Ordinance, or any subsequent amendment, where the required lot area, width and
depth do not meet the regulations of this Zoning Ordinance, may be occupied by

provided that yard, lot coverage and all other requirements are met; and
provided that any contiguous land in common ownership be required to be used to
meet the district lot area, width and depth requirements.

nonconforming use, work may be done for ordinary repairs, or on repair or
replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, provided that
the footprint and height of the structure as it existed when it became
nonconforming, shall not be increased unless in accordance with this chapter.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or
restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be
unsafe by an official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order by
such official.

twenty (20) acres not involving any new streets, public utilities or easement
of access as determined by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   The sale or exchange of parcels between adjoining lot owners, where
such sale or exchange does not create additional building sites as defined by
zoning or these subdivision regulations or reduce the original tract below the
requirements of zoning or these regulations.
      (3)   The establishment of private streets serving industrial structures
on their own property where there is no division of land.
      (4)   The division of land along an existing public street, not involving

involving no more than five (5) lots after the original tract has been
completely subdivided (ORC 711.131).
      (5)   The division or partition of land into parcels of five (5) to
twenty (20) acres where such parcels are used only for agricultural or personal
recreation purposes and not involving any new streets, public utilities, or
easements of access.
   (b)    Major Subdivision. This type of subdivision involves the division of
five (5) or more lots with new streets and related public improvements. A major
subdivision requires a submission of a record plat for Planning Commission
review and approval and recording by the County Recorder. Once recorded, future
transfer of lots in the “platted subdivision” are referenced by lot numbers.
Other requirements of a major subdivision include:
      (1)   A description of street, alleys, common areas/public grounds, and
all in-lots, out-lots, and fractional lots.
      (2)   The plat must also show the courses, boundaries, and extent. (ORC
711.01) In-lots that are numbered sequentially with precise length and width
measurements.
      (3)   The major subdivision plat must be superimposed on a survey of
lands of the owners of the current parcels. It must show an accurate background
drawing of any metes-andbounds descriptions of lands from which the plat is
being drawn (ORC 7111.02(B).
      (4)   The major subdivision plat must show the location of all
monumentation (e.g., cornerstones, markers, and pins) to identify lots and
other survey control points.
      (5)   Major subdivisions must also adhere to established design standards
(such as lay-out of lots, block length, cul-de-sac length, minimum street
right-of-way, pavement width and sidewalk requirements) and engineering
construction standards for the infrastructure improvements as stipulated by the
Village.
   (c)    Large Lot Subdivision. The division of land into parcels of five (5)
to twenty (20) acres along an existing public street, not involving the
opening, widening, or extension of any street or road, and involving the
establishment of any parcel that is not contrary to any applicable zoning,
health, sanitary, or access management regulations. (ORC 711.133) No parcel
shall be created which has less than seventy-five (75) feet of frontage on a
public street or roadway and shall not exceed the maximum depth of three and
one-half (3.5) times the width of the parcel.

registered surveyor or licensed engineer.
   (c)    Filing. The subdivider shall prepare and file the final plat for
approval with the Planning Commission, and as many copies as may be required by
the Commission. The final plat shall be considered officially filed after it is
examined by the Village Engineer and/or the County Engineer, if the proposed
subdivision lies within his jurisdiction, and is found to be in full compliance
with the formal provisions of these rules and regulations.
   The final plat shall be filed at least ten (10) working days prior to the
meeting at which it is to be considered. The final plat shall be filed not
later than twelve (12) months after the date of approval of the preliminary
plat, otherwise it shall be considered void unless extended by formal action of

within forty-five (45) days after the same has been officially filed;
otherwise, the plat shall be deemed to have been approved. The certificate of
the Planning Commission as to the date of submission of the plat for approval
and the failure to act within such time shall be sufficient in lieu of the
written endorsement or evidence of approval herein required. If disapproved,
the grounds for disapproval of the final plat shall be stated on the record of
the Planning Commission including the reference to the regulation violated by
the plat, and a copy of such record of the Commission shall be forwarded to the
subdivider. The subdivider shall make the necessary corrections and resubmit
the final plat within thirty (30) days to the Commission for its approval.
   The subdivider shall be given written notice of the final approval of the
plat by the Planning Commission. The subdivider shall then present the plat to
Council for approval.
   Approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission shall not constitute
acceptance by the Village of the dedication of any public street or open public
grounds shown upon the final plat. (ORC 711.041) The Village Engineer, upon
written request by the owner of the land upon which the street has been
constructed, shall check the construction and if the Engineer finds that such
street has been constructed in accordance with the specifications set forth on
the approved plat, and that such street is in good repair, then such finding,
endorsed on the approved plat, shall constitute an acceptance of the street for
public use by the Village. (ORC 711.091)
   (e)    Recording. The subdivider shall record the final plat in the office
of the Recorder of Ottawa County within sixty (60) days after the date of final
approval, otherwise the final plat shall be considered void.
   The subdivider shall, immediately upon recording, file with the Village
Engineer a reproducible copy of the final plat and all plans and profiles.
   No changes, erasures, modifications or revisions other than those requested
by the Village Engineer, or the Ottawa County Public Health Department, or to
correct metes and bounds, shall be made on the final plat after final approval
has been given by the Planning Commission and the final plat has been recorded
in the office of the County Recorder, unless such plat has first been
resubmitted to the Planning Commission and such change, erasure, modification
or revision has been first approved by the Planning Commission. Any final plat
so changed without first being submitted to the Planning Commission and
reapproved shall institute proceedings to have the plat stricken from the
records of the County Recorder.
   Upon recording, the final plat shall thereupon be a sufficient conveyance to
vest in the Village the fee of the parcel of land designated or intended for
streets, alleys, ways, commons or other public uses, to be held in the
corporate name in trust for the uses and purposes set forth in the instrument.

      (5)    Easements. Easements of at least five (5) feet in width shall be
provided on each side of all rear lot lines and alongside lot lines, where
necessary, for poles, wires, conduits and gas mains. Additional width may be
required for necessary access to the utility involved. Easements may also be
required along or across lots where engineering design or special conditions
may necessitate installation of water and sewer lines outside public rights of
way. A five (5) foot easement shall be required on one side of an alley to
accommodate pole lines. For lots facing on curvilinear streets, the rear
easement shall consist of straight lines with a minimum number of points of
deflection.
Ten (10) foot wide easements shall also be provided adjacent to, and outside of
the street right-of-way lines.
   (e)    Street Names. Names of streets shall be avenue, street, lane, drive

that streets which join or align with streets of an abutting subdivision or
area shall bear the same name.
   (f)    Sidewalks. The design standards for sidewalks may be found in Section
1196.03. (Ord. 13-24. Passed 6-15-24.)
1194.03 BLOCKS.
   (a)    Length. No block shall be longer than 1,200 feet nor less than 500
feet, except in unusual circumstances when considered advisable by the Planning
Commission. Where a subdivision adjoins a major thoroughfare, the greater
dimension of the block shall front along such major highway to minimize the
number of points of ingress or egress.
   (b)    Arrangement of Lots. Blocks shall be arranged so as to provide two
(2) rows or tiers of lots.
   (c)    Crosswalks. Where blocks are over 750 feet in length, a crosswalk

the character of surrounding development.
   (b)    Frontage.
      (1)    On public streets. All lots shall abut by their full frontage on a
publicly dedicated street.
      (2)    Minimum frontage. The minimum frontage of a lot shall be sixty
(60) feet and excessive depth in relation to width shall be avoided. Maximum

corner lots shall be discouraged.
      (4)    Corner lots. Corner lots shall have a minimum frontage of seventy-
five (75) feet measured at the building line in order to permit adequate
setbacks.
   (c)    Side Lot Lines. Side lot lines shall be at right angles to street
lines or radial to curved street lines and shall be straight, except where
variation because of topography or other circumstances will provide a better
subdivision layout.
   (d)    Corner Lot Radius. All corner lots, whether at the intersection of
the rights of way of two (2) streets or of an alley and a street, shall have a
curve with a minimum radius of twenty (20) feet joining the two (2) sidelines
of such rights of way.
   (e)    Setback Line.
      (1)    On secondary and minor streets. The minimum setback line shall be
thirty-five (35) feet measured from the property line and shall be required in
all subdivisions unless larger setbacks are required by zoning ordinances, plat
restrictions or other existing covenants or laws.
      (2)    On major thoroughfares. The minimum setback line shall be thirty-
five (35) feet on all major thoroughfares.
         (Ord. 13-24. Passed 6-15-24.)
   
1194.05 COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL SITES.
   These subdivision regulations may be modified by the Planning Commission for
subdivisions that are proposed for commercial or industrial use. Such
modifications shall be made and required by the Planning Commission as will
assure lot sizes and shapes, landscaping or buffering, signage, lighting,
street standards and arrangements, and off-street parking and loading areas
that are carefully designed to serve the industrial or commercial land uses
which are proposed or permitted. (Ord. 13-24. Passed 6-15-24.)
1194.06 LARGE-SCALE DEVELOPMENTS.
   Large-scale developments, planned business parks, planned unit developments,
multi-use and variable density or cluster developments not otherwise
anticipated by these rules and regulations, shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission for consideration. The Planning Commission shall review such
developments to ensure the adequacy of public open spaces and improvements,
traffic circulation, recreation, education, light, air and the overall needs of
the tract when fully developed and populated. The Planning Commission shall
ascertain that the proposed project will constitute a desirable and stable
development; that it will be in harmony with development in adjoining areas;
and that such covenants, restrictions, financial guarantees and other legal
assurances to guarantee the plan will be followed and fully achieved.
(Ord. 13-24. Passed 6-15-24.)
1194.07 PUBLIC SITES AND OPEN SPACES.
   (a)    Procedure for Allocating Open Space. The allocation of areas for
parks, playgrounds, school sites and other public open spaces shall be by one
(1) of the following methods:
      (1)    Dedication to the Village;
      (2)    Reservation of land for use of property owners by deed or
covenants.
   (b)    Conformance with the Village Open Space Plan. Conformance with the
Village plan for parks and other open public grounds shall be required where a
designated site shown on the Village plan is located in whole or in part within
a proposed subdivision. The Planning Commission may request the subdivider to
dedicate or reserve such area which lies within the subdivision, provided that
the amount of land to be dedicated for park purposes shall not exceed ten
percent (10%) of the total area of the subdivision.
   (c)    Large-scale Developments. For large-scale developments, the Planning
Commission may request the subdivider to dedicate or reserve sites for
playgrounds and parks whose character, extent and location will be suitable to
the needs created by such development, whether or not such sites are shown on
the Village open space plan. Such areas shall be in the judgment of the
Planning Commission, of reasonable size for the particular use. In general, the
subdivider shall be required to set aside ten percent (10%) of the gross area
of the subdivision for this purpose.
   (d)    Money Payments. In lieu of a provision of land for parks and
playgrounds, particularly where such public land will be too small for use, the
Planning Commission may request payment of money to the Village. This payment
must be not more than ten percent (10%) of the market value of the entire tract
prior to subdivision and cannot be used by the Village except to create,
improve, expand or maintain public recreational uses serving the neighborhood
created by or including the subdivision.
   (e)    Surface Water Areas.
      (1)    Easement along streams. Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located within the area being subdivided, the subdivider
shall provide a permanent easement dedicated to the proper authority for the
purpose of widening, deepening, relocating, improving or protecting the stream
for drainage or public use.
      (2)    Flooding and poor drainage. The right is reserved to disapprove
any subdivision which is subject to periodic flooding, or which contains
extremely poor drainage facilities. However, if the subdivider agrees to make
such improvements as will make the subdivision completely safe for residential
occupancy, the subdivision may be approved, subject, however, to the approval
of the Planning Commission, and the Village Engineer.
   (f)    Preservation of Outstanding Features. The preservation of outstanding
features such as scenic spots, historic sites, watercourses, or exceptionally
fine groves of trees shall be shown due regard. Dedication to and acceptance by
a public agency is usually the best means of assuring their preservation. (Ord.
13-24. Passed 6-15-24.)
1194.08 VARIANCES.
   Where topography and other physical conditions make full compliance with the
subdivision design standards of this chapter an undue hardship upon the owner,
the Planning Commission may refer the problem of compliance to the Village
Engineer for recommendations as to possible variances. (Ord. 13-24. Passed 6-
15-24.)

1301.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted by the Municipality, the Ohio Building Code (OBC)
and related codes as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards,
Department of Industrial Relations, effective July 1, 2009, and as identified
and published in Division 4101:1 et seq. of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC).
1301.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units. Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance. Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use. Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization. To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be liberally
construed in order to promote its purpose. When the Building Official finds
that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the provisions of
this Code, it shall be approved. Materials, equipment and devices approved by
the Building Official pursuant to Section 114 of the Ohio Building Code shall
be constructed and installed in accordance with such approval.

1311.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization Village of Elmore. ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3,
of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt
land use and control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the council of the Village of Elmore, State
of Ohio, does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The Village of Elmore has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Elmore as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas
of special flood hazard annexed by Village of Elmore.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map, Ottawa County, Ohio and Incorporated
Areas and Flood Insurance Study, Ottawa County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas,
both effective May 18, 2015.
      (2)   Other studies and I or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard,
include:
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Elmore as required by Section
1311.04(c).
Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at 340 Clinton, Village of Elmore, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Elmore, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 03-15. Passed 4-27-15.)
1311.02 DEFINITIONS.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these regulations
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (1 00) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE):  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operation or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM):  An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone Band Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:  
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Village of Elmore's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term

of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3781.06 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01 , a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Elmore Flood
Insurance Rate Map effective April 1, 1982 and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.

professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of Construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.

   (jj)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1311.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the
Village of Elmore, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Elmore have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Elmore Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village of
Elmore boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
Village of Elmore suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the Village of Elmore has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1311.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, flood way data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. to 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Elmore specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1311.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 03-15. Passed 4-27-15.)
1311.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Council of the Village of Elmore shall appoint an Appeals Board
consisting of the members of the Planning Commission. The members shall serve
five year terms after which time they shall be reappointed or replaced by the
Village Council. Each member shall serve until his/her successor is appointed.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
the Village hall.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 1 0 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing.  
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others.
            2.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate ofrise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsections (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Ottawa County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(Ord. 03-15. Passed 4-27-15.)

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1311.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines

or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a minor misdemeanor. Any
person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as provided
by the laws of the Village of Elmore. Each day such violation continues shall
be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the

1331.08 FIRE DAMAGED STRUCTURES. 
   (a)   The owner, lessee, occupant or person in charge of any building or

safeguard against and/or remove any hazardous conditions resulting from the
fire and to correct and eliminate all unsightly conditions and conditions which
present hazards of additional fires or menaces to health. If the premises are
not to be immediately restored and rehabilitated for occupancy, necessary steps
shall be taken to remove and prevent the occurrence of conditions creating
hazards to safety, health and recurring fires.
   (b)   The Village Superintendent or any deputy designated by him is hereby
authorized at any and all reasonable times and upon complaint or information,

1331.09 FIRE LOSS CLAIMS.
No insurance company doing business in the State of Ohio shall pay a claim of
named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the Village of
Elmore where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under
all insurance policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000) and equals or
exceeds limitations unless there is compliance with the following procedures:
   (a)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
insurance company or insurance companies equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%)
of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies in accordance with
Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Fiscal
Officer in the aggregate amount of one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each
twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), and each fraction of that amount of a claim,
or, if at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named insured or
insureds and the insurance company or companies the named insured or insureds
have submitted a contractor’s signed estimate of the costs of removing,
repairing, or securing the building or other structure, shall transfer from the
insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate.
      (1)   Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies insuring the building or structure. Policy proceeds remaining after
the transfer to the Village may be disbursed in accord with the policy terms.
      (2)   The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure after the amount of the fund in excess of the estimate to the named
insured or insureds.
   (b)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the Village as authorized by this section,
the Fiscal Officer shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used
solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing
incurred by the Village pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
   (c)   When transferring the fund as required by subsection (a) of this
section, an insurance company shall provide the Village with the name and
address of the named insured or insureds whereupon the Village shall contact
the named insured or insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by
the Village and notify them that the following procedures will be followed:
      (1)   The fund shall be returned by the Fiscal Officer to the named
insured or insureds when repairs, or removal, or securing of the building or
other structure have been completed and the required proof is received by the
Fiscal Officer, provided that the Village has not incurred any costs for
repairs, removal or securing. If the Village has incurred any costs for such
repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure, such costs
shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds remain, the Village shall be
construed to limit the ability of the Village to recover any deficiency under
Ohio R.C. 715.261.
      (2)   Nothing in this section or Ohio R.C. 3929.86(C) and (D), as adopted
herein, shall be construed to prohibit the Village and the named insured or
insureds from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to
the named insured or insureds, if some other reasonable disposition of the
damaged property has been negotiated.

Passed 1-24-05.)
1341.04 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD.
   (a)   The Design Review Board shall annually select one of its members to
serve as chairperson and one as vice chairperson. The Fiscal Officer and the
Village Superintendent shall provide such staff assistance as is necessary and
available. All municipal departments and agencies shall cooperate in expediting
the work of the Design Review Board.
   (b)   The Design Review Board shall adopt rules and regulations consistent
with this chapter, governing its procedures and transactions. The Design Review
Board shall meet as required to carry out the review of applications for
Certificates of Appropriateness, and such other related work as may be accepted
through request of Council or undertaken on its own motion. Meetings shall be
held at least once each month when there are applications to be considered and
not less than once a year. Special meetings may be held at the call of the
chairperson of the Design Review Board.
   (c)   Within the boundaries of any Preservation District, the Design Review
Board shall review any proposed new construction and alterations to property
herein defined. The Board’s approval of such new construction and alteration
shall be secured before any owner or property may commence work thereon. In
reviewing proposed alterations to property, the Design Review Board shall at a
minimum use as evaluative criteria, the ten federal standards established by
the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, as follows:
      (1)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property, which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure or
site and its environment, or to use a property for its original intended
purpose.
      (2)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
      (3)   All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
      (4)   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time, are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and
its environment. These changes that may have acquired significance shall be
recognized and respected.
      (5)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship, which characterize a building, structure or site shall be
treated with sensitivity.
      (6)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features, should be substantiated by historic, physical or
pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of
different elements from other building or structure.
      (7)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
      (8)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by or adjacent to, any project.
      (9)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, character of the
property, neighborhood and environment.
      (10)   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
   (d)   The Design Review Board shall also utilize the U.S. Secretary of the
Interior’s Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings in their review and
deliberations.
   (e)   The Design Review Board may amend and/or impose more refined design
review criteria with Council approval based on the Preservation District’s
predominate architecture, historical significance, and its cultural/
archaeological attributes.
(Ord. 15-04. Passed 6-28-04.)
1341.05 TRIGGERING MECHANISM FOR DESIGN REVIEW.
   Once a property owner applies for a building or zoning permit for an
alteration within the Preservation District, the permit application will be
deemed as an application to the Design Review Board. All property owners within
the Preservation District must receive Design Review Board approval prior to
building permit issuance.
(Ord. 15-04. Passed 6-28-04.)
1341.06 LIMITATIONS ON ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS, CERTIFICATE
OF OCCUPANCY AND DEMOLITION PERMITS.
No alteration of any structure of significant exterior architectural feature
thereof in any designated Preservation District shall be undertaken prior to
obtaining a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Zoning Inspector and a
Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued by the Zoning Inspector for the
construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition of any area, place,
site, building, structure, object or work of art within a designated
Preservation District unless the application for such permit is approved by the
Design Review Board through the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness in
the manner described herein.
(Ord. 15-04. Passed 6-28-04.)
1341.07 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   When the owner of a property within a Preservation District proposes
new construction or alteration in any portion of a structure within the
District he/she shall first apply for (through the Zoning Inspector) and secure
a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Design Review Board. The application
for a Certificate shall be made with the Zoning Inspector, together with such
plans, specifications and other material as the Design Review Board may from
time to time prescribe.
   (b)   Within forty-five (45) days of filing, the Design Review Board shall
consider the applications, plans and specifications.
   (c)   If the proposed alteration is determined by the Design Review Board,
to have no adverse effect on the Preservation District, and does not violate
the spirit and purpose of these regulations, then the Board Secretary shall
issue the Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (d)   If the Design Review Board determines that the proposed alteration
will have an adverse effect on the Preservation District, and does violate the
spirit and purposes of these regulations, then the Board shall deny issuance of
the Certificate of Appropriateness.
   (e)   In the event that the Design Review Board determines within the forty-
five (45) day review period that a Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be
issued, it shall forthwith state in its records reasons for such determination
and may include recommendations respecting the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration, or demolition of any area, place, building,
structure, site, object or work of art. The Secretary of the Board shall
forthwith notify the applicant and the Zoning Inspector of such determination
and transmit to him/her a certified copy of the reasons, if any, for denial and
recommendations of the Board.
   (f)   Upon denying a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Board shall impose
a waiting period of at least thirty (30) days, but not to exceed six (6) months
from the date of disapproval, during which time the Board shall negotiate with
the owner of the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable
to both. The first meeting between the Board and the applicant shall be held
within thirty (30) days from the date of disapproval. If a compromise proposal
is accepted by both parties, the Board may henceforth issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness.
   (g)   In the case of a denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness for
demolition:
      (1)   The Board and applicant shall undertake meaningful and continuing
discussion during the waiting period in order to find a means of preserving the
property. The Board and applicant shall investigate the feasibility of all
means of preserving the listed property. If the Board and applicant do not
agree on a means of preserving the structure at the initial meeting, then they
must continue to undertake meaningful and continuing discussions for the
purpose of finding a method of saving the structure, and such good faith
meeting shall be held at least every forty-five (45) days after the initial
meeting.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith, at the
time specified, then the Board’s denial of the application shall stand.
      (3)   If, after holding such good faith meeting in the waiting period
specified by the Board, the Board determines that failure to issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment
to the public welfare and without substantial deviation from the purposes of
this chapter, then and in such event, the Secretary of the Board shall issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness for such proposed construction, reconstruction
or alteration.
      (4)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period by
the Board, no alternative solution to incompatible construction, reconstruction
or alteration is reached, then the applicant may appeal the decision to
Council. Council may affirm or reverse the Board’s decision. If Council affirms
the decision the denial of Certificate of Appropriateness will stand. (Ord. 15-
04. Passed 6-28-04.)
1341.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this chapter or the application thereof is held invalid,
such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this
chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application
and to this end the provisions of this chapter are hereby declared severable.
(Ord. 15-04. Passed 6-28-04.)
1341.09 MINIMUM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT.

District shall provide sufficient maintenance and upkeep for such structure to
