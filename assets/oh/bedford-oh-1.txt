EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

CHARTER OF THE CITY OF BEDFORD, OHIO
EDITOR'S NOTE: Words in one gender include the other gender.
(
Art. XIII, Sec. 7)
PREAMBLE
   We, the people of the Village of Bedford in the County of Cuyahoga and State
of Ohio, in order to secure for ourselves the benefits of local self-government
under the Constitution of the State of Ohio, do ordain and establish this
Charter for the government of the Village of Bedford.
ARTICLE I
NAME AND POWERS
SECTION I-1. GENERAL POWERS.
   The inhabitants of the Village of Bedford, as its limits now are or
hereafter may be, shall be a body politic and corporate by name The Village of
Bedford, and as such shall have perpetual succession. If and when the Village
of Bedford shall, under the Constitution and general law, become a city, it
shall be known as the City of Bedford, and wherever in this Charter the word
"Village" appears, it shall then be construed to read “City”, and the
provisions of this Charter shall apply whether the Municipality is a Village or
a City. It shall have all powers of local self-government which now are, or
hereafter may be granted to municipalities by the Constitution or laws of the
State of Ohio, either expressly or by implication, as fully as though every
such power were expressly enumerated herein. The enumeration of or reference to
particular powers by this Charter shall not be construed to be exclusive.
SECTION I-2. CHANGE OF BOUNDARIES AND ANNEXATION.
   The City of Bedford shall have the power and authority to change its
boundaries and annex other territory contiguous to it in the manner authorized
by the general laws of Ohio, but no corporate boundary of the City shall be
changed, nor shall the City be annexed to any other municipality, without the
consent of a majority of its electors voting on such question. Such question
shall be submitted to the electors only at a regular election in such manner as
Council shall by resolution or ordinance prescribe. (11-5-91)
ARTICLE II
COUNCIL
SECTION II-1(a). POWERS, NUMBER AND TERM.
   Except as otherwise provided in this Charter all powers of the Municipality
shall be vested in a Council of seven (7) members.
   Beginning with the general election to be held in November, 2001, and
thereafter when Councilpersons are to be elected they shall be elected by
wards, one from each, by the electors of the ward in which they reside, there
being six wards, and one shall be elected at large, by the electors of the
entire Municipality and he shall be the Mayor.
   The terms of the members of Council and the Mayor shall begin on the first
day of January next following their election, and, except as further provided
in this section, they shall serve for a term of four years, or until their
successors are chosen and qualified.
   Notwithstanding the foregoing regarding members of Council and the Mayor
serving a term of four years, each Councilperson elected from Wards 2, 4 and 6
in each case at the general election to be held in November, 2001 and in
accordance with this
Section 1(a) of Article II of this Charter shall serve for an initial term of
two years, or until their successors are chosen and qualified, and thereafter
each Councilperson elected from Wards 2, 4 and 6 shall serve for a term of four
years, or until their successors are chosen and qualified.
(11-7-00)
SECTION II-1(b). WARDS.
   The City of Bedford shall be divided into six (6) wards numbered 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 and 6.
(11-2-82)
EDITOR'S NOTE: Council, under provisions of
Section 1 (c) of this Charter, redistricted the six wards of the City in
Resolution 1831-
81, passed April 20, 1981.
SECTION II-1(c). EQUALIZATION OF WARDS.
   It shall be the duty of Council to review the voter strength of each ward
using official federal census figures every ten years based on population as
the basis of the estimate, in the interest of equalizing voter strength in all
wards, and Council shall have the power, by Resolution to make such boundary
changes as they deem necessary or required with the provision that such
Resolution may not be passed in less than Three (3) Readings and may not
shorten the term of any Councilperson.
(5-2-61; 11-2-82; 11-8-22)
SECTION II-2. QUALIFICATIONS.
   Each member of Council, for at least two (2) years immediately prior to the
election or appointment, shall have been a resident of the Municipality, and
shall also have been a resident of his ward one (1) year prior to the election
or appointment. During such one (1) year period prior to such election or
appointment and during his term in office he shall continue to be a resident of
the ward from which he was elected or appointed, and shall have had and
continue to have the qualifications of an elector thereof. He shall not hold
any other public office except that of Notary Public or member of the State
Militia.
(5-3-60; 11-2-82; 11-8-22)
SECTION II-3. REMOVAL.
   The Council shall be the judge of the qualifications of its own members as
defined in
Article II, Section 2. The Council shall also be the judge of the conduct of
its own members. It may expel or remove any member for gross misconduct or
malfeasance or nonfeasance in or disqualification for office, or for conviction
of a crime including moral turpitude while in office, or upon conviction for
violation of the oath of office, or persistent failure to abide by the rules of
Council, or absence without justifiable excuse from four (4) consecutive
regular meetings of Council; provided, however, that such expulsion or removal
shall be upon concurrence of five (5) or more members of Council and after
public hearing upon the charge or charges brought; and provided, further that
the accused member shall have been notified in writing of any charge or charges
at least fifteen (15) days in advance of such public hearing, and provided,
further, that the member of Council shall have been given an opportunity to be
heard, present evidence, and examine witnesses appearing in support of such
charge or charges. The decision of Council in expelling or removing a member of
Council after compliance with this section shall be final and thereupon the
office of any such removed or expelled member of Council shall be vacant.
(11-2-82)
SECTION II-4. VACANCIES.
   In the event that Council shall determine that a vacancy exists in the
office of any member of Council, other than the Mayor, the Council shall by a
majority of its remaining members appoint a qualified interim successor to the
office of the vacant member of the Council within sixty (60) days. Council
shall announce the vacancy within ten (10) days of occurrence. If the vacancy
is determined during the last year of the vacated officer's term, then the
person appointed to fill the vacancy as the interim successor shall serve for
the remainder of the unexpired term; otherwise, an election shall be held at
the next regular municipal or general election to be held more than ninety (90)
days after the determination of the vacancy, at which election a qualified
person shall be elected to fill the unexpired term of office, and the person
elected at that election shall take office five days after the final
certification of his or her election by the election authorities or as soon
thereafter as may be practical. In the event that three or fewer persons
continue as members of the Council, then those officers designated in Section 8
of this Article II shall serve as temporary members of the Council for the
purpose of selecting the interim successors, and such officers shall cease to
serve on the Council upon the qualification of the interim successors. Such
officers serving as temporary members of the Council shall have all powers,
duties and functions of a member of the Council during their temporary tenure
on the Council. The provisions in the last paragraph of Section 8 of this
Article II providing that such officers designated as temporary at large
council members shall serve "until an election can be held as is otherwise set
forth in this Charter" shall be inapplicable and considered to have been
repealed on and after January 1, 1992. A vacancy in the office of Mayor shall
be filled in the manner set forth in Section 8 of Article II of this Charter.
(11-2-71; 11-2-82; 11-5-91; 11-8-22)
SECTION II-5. SALARIES.
   The Mayor and members of Council shall receive such compensation as the
Council shall establish by ordinance, provided that the salary of the Mayor and
Council shall not be increased during their term in office.
(11-7-72; 11-2-82)
SECTION II-6. QUORUM, ATTENDANCE, RULES.
   Four (4) members of Council shall constitute a quorum to do business, but a
majority of the members present may adjourn from time to time to compel the
attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as may be
prescribed by ordinance. Should any member of Council be absent from as many as
four (4) consecutive regular meetings, he shall thereby forfeit his seat in
Council, unless such absence be authorized and excused by Council.
   Council shall determine its own rules and order of business, provide for
special meetings and keep a journal of its proceedings.
(11-2-82)
SECTION II-7. MEETINGS.
   At 8:00 p.m., on the second day of January following a regular Municipal
election, or if such day be Sunday, in the day following, Council shall meet at
the usual place for holding such meetings for the purpose of organization.
Thereafter, Council shall meet at such times as may be prescribed by ordinance
or resolution, except that it shall hold regular at least twice during each
calendar month, except June, July and August, when one (1) regular meeting only
is required.
   All regular meetings, work sessions and special meetings of the Council at
which any legislative action is discussed or taken, shall be open to the
public. Any resident of Bedford shall be entitled to speak at such meetings of
the Council. Such right shall not be unreasonably abridged by any rules and
regulations which Council may adopt.
(11-2-71; 11-2-82; 11-2-10)
SECTION II-8. MAYOR AND VICE-MAYOR.
   Council shall, at the time of organizing and every two years (2 yrs.)
thereafter, elect one (1) of its members who shall have the title of Vice-
Mayor.
   The Mayor shall preside at all meetings of Council and shall have a voice
and a vote in its proceedings, but no veto. Except as the same are otherwise
disposed of or provided for herein, he shall exercise all the powers and
discharge all the duties imposed upon mayors of municipalities by the general
laws of the State of Ohio, which are not inconsistent with the provisions of
this Charter, but nothing herein provided shall be construed as conferring upon
him any administrative functions herein conferred upon other officers. Upon the
written request of the Mayor to a director or department head, said director or
department head shall furnish such information requested, in writing, and a
copy of such information shall be forwarded to the City Manager. The Mayor
shall be an ex-officio member of all appointed or elected boards or commissions
and shall serve on such boards and commissions in an advisory capacity without
a vote.
   The Mayor shall be recognized as the official head of the Municipality for
all ceremonial purposes. In time of public danger or emergency he shall assist
the City Manager-Safety Director in maintaining order and enforcing the law. In
the case of the absence or incapacity of the Mayor, the Vice-Mayor shall have
all the powers herein conferred upon the Mayor. In the absence or incapacity of
the Mayor and the Vice-Mayor, a majority of Council may appoint an acting
Mayor. In the event of the death or resignation of the Mayor, the Vice-Mayor
shall become Mayor. If the Vice-Mayor declines to be Mayor, or is unable to
serve, the Council may elect one (1) of its members Mayor. In the event the
office of Vice-Mayor becomes vacant, Council shall elect one (1) of its members
Vice-Mayor, no later than the next regular meeting for the unexpired term.
   In the event that a catastrophic event occurs and three (3) or less
Councilpersons are able to continue to serve on the Council then, in the
following order, the Chairman of the Planning Commission, the Chairman of the
Board of Zoning Appeals, the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission, the
Chairman of the Board of Building Standards and Appeals, or in the absence of
such a Chairman, a member of such board or commission nominated by the
remaining members as acting chairman, shall become temporarily appointed as
councilman-at-large until an election can be held as is otherwise set forth in
this Charter.
(11-2-71; 11-2-82)
SECTION II-9. APPOINTEES.
   Council shall appoint a City Manager, a Director of Finance, a Director of
Law and a Clerk of Council. The Clerk of Council shall be responsible for all
official records of the Municipality and such other duties as the Council shall
determine.
   Council may create and establish any other offices and positions which it
may deem necessary in connection with the administration of the Municipal
affairs, not otherwise provided for herein.
   Neither Council nor any of its members or committees shall dictate the
appointment of any person to office or employment by the Manager or by the
Director of Law in the case of the appointment of the Assistant Director of
Law, nor in any manner interfere with or prevent (i) the Manager from
exercising his own judgment in the appointment of officers and employees in the
administrative service or (ii) the Director of Law from exercising his own
judgment in the appointment of the Assistant Director of Law in the
administrative service within the Department of Law. Except for the purpose of
inquiry Council shall deal with the administrative service, solely through the
Manager. No member of Council shall give orders to the subordinates of the
Manager or Council appointees.
   The Council shall have the power to make all appointments to all City boards
or commissions established by this Charter or by ordinance. Council shall have
the power to make appointments for the unexpired term, if any vacancies occur,
for any reason, on any appointive City board or commission. The Council will
suspend any appointed member of any board or commission after four (4)
consecutive absences "without justifiable excuse" or for other just cause. Such
suspended member shall have the right, if he so requests, to have a public
hearing before Council, within thirty (30) days after such suspension, and may
be removed from office only after an affirmative vote of four (4) members of
Council.
(11-2-71; 11-2-82; Ord. 5-7-02.)
SECTION II-10. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   Council may by general ordinance provide for legislative procedure; the form
and method of enactment of ordinances; a simplified procedure for levying
assessments; the method and manner of giving public notice of the passage of
ordinances or resolutions of a general or permanent nature; the advertisement
and sale of bonds and notes; and the advertisement and awarding of public
contracts. Such general ordinances, when once adopted, shall not be repealed or
amended except by vote of five (5) members of Council or by the people.
SECTION II-11. CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
   No member of Council, nor the City Manager, nor any other officer or
employee, of the Municipality shall be directly or indirectly interested in any
contract, job, work, or service with or for the Municipality; nor in the
profits or emoluments thereof; nor in the expenditure of any money on the part
of the Municipality; and any contract with the Municipality in which any
officer or employee is or becomes interested may be declared void by Council.
Nor shall the Mayor or members of Council, or directors of departments during
their terms of office, nor any other employee of the Municipality, during his
employment by the Municipality, practice law or give legal advice or be
associated with another in the practice of law in any matter or controversy in
wich the Municipality is or may become a party, except on behalf of the
Municipality as an officer or employee. Any willful violation of this section
shall constitute malfeasance in office, and any such officer or employee found
guilty thereof under the terms of this Charter or under the provisions of the
general law, shall forthwith forfeit his office, and the office shall be filled
in accordance with the provisions of this Charter as to vacancies.
   No elected or appointed officer or employee of the City, for one year (1
yr.) after termination thereof, may himself be the representative of any
person, firm or corporation to the City of Bedford on any subject matter where
he acted in his official capacity during his term of office or employment. But
Council, for good and just cause, may waive any violations of this section
after hearing. Council may provide a procedure for complaints, hearings and
penalties.
(11-2-71; 11-2-82)
SECTION II-12. CONFLICT OF INTEREST (BOARDS, COMMISSIONS, COMMITTEES).
   No member of any board, commission or committee created by Charter,
ordinance or resolution shall have any financial interest, direct or indirect
or by reason of ownership of stock in any corporation (except as permitted by
the laws of Ohio) in any matter pending before the board, commission or
committee of which he is a member. In the event that such a conflict arises,
the affected member shall abstain from discussion and voting on the issue or
matter in which he has such an interest. The affected member shall not be
required to resign from the board, commission, or committee of which he is a
member. Any willful violation of this section shall constitute malfeasance in
office and any member of a board, commission or committee found guilty thereof
shall thereby forfeit his office or position.
(11-2-82)
ARTICLE III
CITY MANAGER
SECTION III-1. APPOINTMENT.
   A City Manager shall be appointed by Council to serve at the will of
Council, a vote of the majority of all the members of Council being required
for his appointment.
   He may be removed from office by the vote of the majority of all the members
of Council. At least thirty (30) days before such removal shall become
effective, Council shall by a majority vote of its members adopt a preliminary
resolution stating the reasons for his removal. The City Manager may reply in
writing and may request a public hearing, which shall be held not earlier than
twenty (20) days or later than thirty (30) days after the filing of such
request, but pending and during such hearing Council may suspend him from
office. After such public hearing, if one be requested, and after full
consideration, Council may by majority vote of all its members adopt a final
resolution of removal. The action of Council in suspending or removing the City
Manager shall be final, it being the intention of this Charter to vest all
authority and fix all responsibility for such suspension and removal in
Council. Until the City Manager is chosen, or in the event of his disability or
suspension, Council may designate someone to perform the duties of City Manager
during such period.
(5-2-61)
   
SECTION III-2. QUALIFICATIONS.
   The City Manager need not be a resident of the Municipality at the time of
his appointment, but shall reside therein during his tenure of office. The City
Manager shall be chosen by the Council solely on the basis of his executive and
administrative qualifications as judged by the adequacy of his technical
training and his successful experience in administration.
(11-2-82)
SECTION III-3. POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The City Manager shall be the chief administrative officer of the
Municipality, and shall be responsible to Council for the proper administration
of all affairs of the Municipality and the enforcement of all the laws and
ordinances, except as herein otherwise provided; and to that end he shall have
authority to appoint and remove all other administrative officers and
employees, except as otherwise provided herein. He shall attend all meetings of
Council, with the right to participate in its discussions, but without the
right of vote; and he shall attend meetings of any committee of Council when so
required by such committee. He shall prepare and submit to Council the annual
budget, after receiving estimates made by the directors of the several
departments, and shall perform such other duties as may be prescribed by this
Charter or by the ordinances or resolutions of Council.
   Excepting the Department of Finance, the Department of Law, and excepting
the Department of Public Health, if and when the Department of Public Health is
created by Council as hereinafter provided, the City Manager shall be the
Director of Public Safety and director of each and every department of the
Government until otherwise provided by Council.
   The Manager shall be the purchasing agent for the Municipality and as such
purchasing agent shall make all purchases and contracts for the purchase of
supplies, materials and equipment required by the Municipality and every
department thereof. When an expenditure within any department, other than the
compensation of persons employed therein, exceeds the amount set forth in Ohio
Revised Code Section 731.14, or any successor statute thereto, such
expenditures shall first be authorized and directed by ordinance of Council.
When so authorized and directed, the Manager shall make a written contract with
the lowest responsive and responsible bidder after advertisement in the manner
provided by general law or ordinance.
(11-2-71; 11-2-82; 11-7-00)
ARTICLE IV
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS AND DEPARTMENTS
SECTION IV-1. DEPARTMENTS.
   The following administrative departments are hereby established; Department

for the organization thereof, and, by vote of five members may create new
departments, combine or abolish existing departments, and establish temporary
departments for special work.
(11-7-00)
SECTION IV-2. DIRECTORS.
   There shall be a director of each department, who shall have the supervision
and control thereof and who, with the exception of the Director of Law and the
Director of Finance, shall be appointed by and shall be immediately responsible
to the City Manager for the administration of his department. The Director of
Law and the Director of Finance shall be appointed by Council and shall be
immediately responsible to Council for the discharge of their respective
duties. The Director of Finance shall be responsible for the collection and
custody of all the funds of the Municipality from whatever source derived.
   The Director of Law shall be an attorney at law admitted to practice in the
State of Ohio. He shall be the legal advisory of and attorney and counsel for
the Municipality and for all officers and departments thereof in matters
relating to their official duties. He shall prepare all contracts bonds and
other instruments in writing in which the Municipality is concerned and shall
endorse on each his approval of the form and correctness thereof. When required
by resolution of Council, he shall prosecute or defend, for and in behalf of
the Municipality, all complaints, suits and controversies in which the
Municipality is a party, and such other suits, matters and controversies as he
shall, by resolution or ordinance, be directed to prosecute or defend. He
shall, when so requested, give his opinion or advice in writing to Council, the
Manager, the Director of any department, or to any officer or commission not
included within a department upon any question of law involving their
respective powers or duties. He shall have the authority to appoint and remove
the Assistant Director of Law who shall serve at his pleasure.
   Upon being satisfied that funds of the Municipality or public moneys in the
hands of the Director of Finance or belonging to the Municipality are about to
be or have been misapplied, or that any public moneys have been illegally drawn
or withheld from the treasury, or that a contract in contravention to law has
been or is about to be entered into, or has been or is being executed, or that
a contract was procured by fraud or corruption, or that any property, real or
personal, belonging to the Municipality, is being illegally used or occupied,
or is being used or occupied in violation of contract, or that the terms of a
contract made by or on behalf of the Municipality are being or have been
violated, or that money is due the Municipality, the Director of Law shall
apply by civil action, in the name of the Municipality, to a court of competent
jurisdiction to restrain such contemplated misapplication of funds, or the
completion of such illegal contract not fully completed or to recover for the
use of the Municipality all public moneys so misapplied or illegally drawn or
withheld from the treasury, or to recover for the benefit of the Municipality
damages resulting from the execution of such illegal contract, or to recover
for the benefit of the Municipality such real or personal property so used or
occupied, or to recover, for the benefit of the Municipality, damages arising
from the nonperformance of the terms of such contract, or to otherwise enforce
it, or to recover such money due the Municipality.
   If the Director of Law fails, upon the written request of a taxpayer of the
Municipality, to make the application or institute the civil action
contemplated in the preceding paragraph, such taxpayer may make such
application or institute such civil action in the name of the Municipality; or,
in any case wherein the Director of Law is authorized to make such application,
bring any suit or institute such proceedings against any Municipal officer or
person holding or having held a Municipal office, for misconduct in office,
neglect of duty prescribed by law, to recover money illegally drawn or
illegally withheld from the treasury, to recover damages resulting from the
execution of such illegal contract, and upon the written request of a taxpayer
of the Municipality, to bring such suit or institute such proceedings, shall
fail, neglect or refuse so to do, or where for any reason the Director of Law
cannot bring such action, or where the Director of Law has received and
unlawfully withheld moneys belonging to the Municipality, or has received or
drawn out of the treasury, public moneys which he is not lawfully entitled to
demand and receive, a taxpayer, upon securing the costs, may bring such suit,
or institute such proceedings, in the name of the Municipality, and such action
shall be for the benefit of the Municipality as if brought by the Director of
Law.
   If the court hearing such case is satisfied that such taxpayer is entitled
to the relief prayed for in his petition, and judgment is ordered in his favor,
he shall be allowed his costs, including a reasonable compensation to his
attorney.
   If and when the Council shall, under the power herein granted that body,
establish a Department of Public Health, the Director of Public Health shall be
appointed by the City Manager and be responsible to him for the discharge of
his duties. He shall be a physician who shall have been duly admitted to
practice in the State of Ohio.
   Nothing in this article contained shall be construed as preventing the same
person from being director of more than one (1) department.
(5-7-02)
SECTION IV-3. SALARIES AND BONDS.
   Council shall fix by ordinance the salary, rate or amount of compensation of
all officers and employees of the Municipality, except as otherwise provided in
this Charter. Council may require any officer or employee to give a bond for
the faithful performance of his duties, in such an amount as it may determine,
and it may provide that the premium therefor shall be paid by the Municipality.
SECTION IV-4. APPOINTMENTS OF DIRECTORS OF LAW, FINANCE AND CLERK OF COUNCIL.
   A Director of Law and a Director of Finance and a Clerk of Council shall be
appointed by Council to serve at the will of Council, a vote of the majority of
all the members of Council being required for their appointment.
   They may be removed from office by the vote of the majority of all the
members of Council. At least thirty (30) days before such removal shall become
effective, Council shall, by a majority vote of its members adopt a preliminary
resolution stating the reasons for the removal. The Director of Law or Director
of Finance or the Clerk of Council may reply in writing and may request a
public hearing, which shall be held not earlier than twenty (20) days or later
than thirty (30) days after the filing of such request, but pending and during
such hearing, Council may suspend such Director or Clerk from office. After
such public hearing, if one is requested, and after full consideration, Council
may by a majority vote of all its members, adopt a resolution of removal. The
action of Council in suspending or removing the Director of Law or Director of
Finance or the Clerk of Council shall be final, it being the intention of this
Charter to vest all authority and fix all responsibility for such suspension
and removal in Council. Until the Director of Law or Director of Finance or the
Clerk of Council is chosen, or in the event of their disability or suspension,
Council may designate an "acting director" to perform the duties of the
Director of Law or Director of Finance or "acting clerk of council" during such
period.

INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM AND RECALL
SECTION VI-1. INITIATIVE.
   The people reserve unto themselves the right to propose, by initiative
petition, any legislative measure, including the repeal of ordinances adopted
by Council, approved by referendum vote or initiated by the people. Such
initiative petition must contain the signatures of not less than fifteen per
centum (15%) of the registered electors of the Municipality.
   When there shall have been filed a petition signed by the aforestated
required number of electors proposing an ordinance or other measure, the Clerk
shall certify the same to Council at the next regular meeting, and Council
shall at once read and refer the same to an appropriate committee which may be
the committee of the whole; provision may be made by such committee of Council
for public hearings upon the proposed legislation before the committee to which
it is referred, thereafter the committee shall report the proposed measure to
Council with the recommendations thereon not later than the second regular
meeting of Council following that at which the proposed measure was submitted
to Council.
   Upon receiving the proposed measure from the committee, Council shall at
once proceed to consider the same and shall take final action thereon within
thirty (30) days from the date of such committee's report. If Council rejects
the proposed measure, or passes it in a form different from that set forth in
the petition, the committee of the petitioners may require that it be submitted
to a vote of the electors in its original form or that it be submitted to a
vote of the electors with any proposed change, addition or amendment which was
presented in writing, either at a public hearing before the committee to which
such proposed measure was referred, or during the consideration thereof by
council, and shall certify such fact to the Clerk within ten (10) days after
the final action on such proposed measure by Council, who shall forthwith
certify the same to Council, which shall call an election.
   No measure initiated by the people and adopted by popular vote shall be
repealed by Council, or so amended by it as to destroy the effectiveness
thereof, within two years (2 yrs.) after it takes effect.
SECTION VI-2. REFERENDUM.
   Any ordinance or other measure passed by Council shall be subject to
referendum, except as hereinafter provided. No ordinance or other measure shall
go into effect until thirty (30) days after it shall have been passed by
Council, except as hereinafter provided; but nothing herein contained shall
prevent the Municipality, after the passage of any ordinance or other measure,
from proceeding at once to give any notice or make any tender or publication
required by such a measure, by this Charter, by general law or by general
ordinance.
   When there shall have been filed a petition signed by not less than fifteen
per centum (15%) of the electors of the Municipality within thirty (30) days
after any ordinance or other measure shall have been passed by Council,
ordering that such ordinance or other measure be submitted to the electors of
the Municipality for their approval or rejection, the Clerk shall, at the next
regular meeting of Council, certify such petition to Council. Council shall
thereupon proceed to reconsider such ordinance or other measure. If upon such
reconsideration the ordinance or other measure be not entirely repealed,
Council shall provide for submitting it to a vote of the electors as herein
elsewhere provided. No such ordinance or measure shall go into effect until
approved by a majority of those voting on the same.
   Whenever Council is by law or provisions of general ordinance required to
pass more than one ordinance or other measure to complete the legislation
necessary to make and pay for any public improvement, the provisions of this
section shall apply only to the first ordinance or other measure required to be
passed and not to any subsequent ordinances or other measures relating thereto.
   Whenever the electors shall have authorized the issuance of bonds,
subsequent ordinances or other measures relating to the issuance of such bonds
shall not be subject to the provisions of this section.
   Ordinances or other measures providing for appropriations for current
expenses, and emergency ordinances or measures necessary for the immediate
preservation of the public peace, health or safety, shall go into immediate
effect and shall not be subject to the provisions of this section.
   Such emergency ordinances or measures must upon an aye and nay vote receive
the vote of five (5) members of Council and the reasons for such necessity
shall be set forth in one section of the ordinance or other measure.
SECTION VI-3. RECALL.
   (a)   The people reserve unto themselves the right to recall and remove from
office any member of Council or the Mayor, after he shall have served six
months (6 mos.) of his term. The process to effect such recall or removal shall
be as follows:
   A petition demanding that the question of removal of such officer or
officers be submitted to the electors, shall clearly state in the petition in
not more than two hundred (200) words, the reasons or grounds for such removal.
A petition for the recall of the Mayor shall contain the signatures of twenty-
five per centum (25%) of the voters voting at the last regular general election
of Municipal officers. A petition for the recall of a Councilperson in a ward
shall contain the signatures of twenty-five per centum (25%) of the voters
voting in that ward in the last regular general election of Municipal officers.
   When there shall have been filed a petition signed by the aforestated
required number of electors, the Clerk shall certify the same to Council at the
next regular meeting and shall furnish a copy thereof to the member or members
of Council or the Mayor whose removal is so sought, and the Council shall call
an election upon the question of such removal as herein elsewhere provided,
unless within five (5) days after such certification the member or members of
Council, or the Mayor, tender his or their written resignation to the Clerk.
   (b)   If a majority of the votes cast at such election on the question of
removal of any member of Council or the Mayor is affirmative, the person whose
removal is so sought shall thereupon be deemed removed from office upon the
certification of the official canvass of that election to Council, and a
vacancy caused by such recall shall be filled by the remainder of the Council
according to the provisions of
Article II of this Charter.
   If however, an election is held for the recall of more than three (3)
members of Council, candidates to succeed them for their unexpired terms shall
be voted upon at the same election and shall be nominated by petitions dated
and verified in the manner required for petitions presenting names of
candidates for regular Municipal elections and similar in form to such
petitions and filed with the election authorities at least seventy-five (75)
days prior to such recall election, but no such nominating petition shall be
signed or circulated until such recall petition has been certified to Council,
and any signatures antedating such time shall not be counted. (5-2-61)
SECTION VI-4. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   Any initiative or referendum petition, or one for a recall, may be presented
in separate parts. Each part of any initiative petition shall contain a full
and correct copy of the title and text of the proposed ordinance or other
measure, and each part of any referendum petition shall contain the number and
a full and correct copy of the title of the ordinance or other measure sought
to be referred, but need not contain the full text of such ordinance or other
measure.
   Each signer of a petition shall be a registered voter of the City and shall
sign his name in ink or indelible pencil and shall place on the petition his
name and place of residence by street and number, the date of the signing, and
his voting precinct. Each part of any such petition shall contain the affidavit
of the person soliciting the signatures to the same, which affidavit shall
contain a statement of the number of signers of such part of such petition and
shall state that to the best of the affiant's knowledge and belief each of the
signatures contained on such part is the genuine signature of the person whose
name it purports to be, and that he believes such persons are registered
electors of the City and that they signed such petition with knowledge of the
contents thereof. Each part of such petition also shall have printed thereon
the names and addresses of at least three registered electors who shall be
officially regarded as filing the petition and shall constitute a committee of
the petitioners for the purpose herein elsewhere named.
   All such petitions shall be filed with the Clerk of Council not later than
ninety (90) days from the date of the first signature affixed to such petition
and all parts of any such petition shall be assembled by the Clerk as one
instrument.
   Within ten (10) days after the filing of a petition the Clerk shall
ascertain whether the same is signed by the required number of qualified
electors, and whether all signatures were affixed within the period of ninety
(90) days prior to the filing thereof. Upon the completion of his examination
the Clerk shall endorse upon the petition a certificate of the result thereof.
Any signer of such petition may withdraw his support to the same, and his
signature shall not be counted or considered if he gives written notice to the
Clerk of his desire for such withdrawal at any time before final certification.
   If the Clerk's certificate shows that the petition is insufficient he shall
at once notify each member of the committee of the petitioners herein elsewhere
provided for, and the petition may be amended at any time within fifteen (15)
days from the date of the Clerk's certificate of examination by filing with the
Clerk an additional petition in one or more parts in the same manner as
provided for the original petition. In the event that it shall be determined by
judicial proceedings that the certificate of the Clerk as to the sufficiency of
the petition is erroneous, a similar period of time shall be granted for
additional petitions after the final determination of such question.
   Upon the filing of any such additional petitions, the Clerk shall within ten
(10) days thereafter examine the petition as thus amended and attach thereto
his certificate of the result, and the petition shall thereafter be treated in
the same manner as it would have been treated after the original certification.
The final determination of the insufficiency of a petition shall not prevent
the filing of a new petition for the same purpose.
   The sufficiency of the number of signers to any initiative, referendum or
recall petition, shall be determined on the basis of the number of registered
voters at the last general election for Municipal officers.
   The filing of an initiative, referendum or recall petition by the Clerk of
Council within the times herein elsewhere provided shall be computed from the
date of the attaching of the final certificate of the Clerk to such petition.
   Whenever it becomes the duty of Council to call an election by reason of the
filing of an initiative or referendum petition, or one for recall, Council
shall call an election for the submission of such question, or recall, at the
next regular primary or general election occurring not less than forty (90)
days nor more than ninety (120) days thereafter. If no such regular primary or
general election is to be held within such time, Council shall provide for
calling a special election not less than forty (90) days nor more than ninety
(120) days thereafter. In either event, Council shall certify its action to the
Board of Elections.
(11-2-71; 11-5-91)
SECTION VI-5. OFFICIAL PUBLICITY.
   The Clerk of Council shall prepare and publish the official publicity
required by the Charter amendment, initiated or referred ordinance or recall of
an elected official by publication in newspapers in general circulation in the
City in accordance with Article XVIII, Sections 8 and 9 and State law. Council
may publish such additional information as may be necessary to inform the
public prior to such election.
(11-2-71)
 
ARTICLE VII
FINANCES
SECTION VII-1. BUDGET.
   The finances of the Municipality shall always be conducted upon the budget
system. The City Manager, with the assistance of the Director of Finance, shall
furnish to Council at such time prior to the fifteenth (15th) day of June of
each year (or at such other date at least thirty days prior to such date as may
from time to time be fixed by general law for the certifying of the budget of
the Municipality to the Budget Commissioners of the County or other similar
officials having charge of taxation matters), as may be required by Council, an
annual budget setting forth in itemized form an estimate stating the amount of
money needed for the various departments in the Municipality, and for each
month thereof. Such annual budget shall set forth specifically such items as
may be required by general law or by ordinance of Council, and Council shall
thereupon and within such time as may be prescribed by general law approve or
revise such budget and submit the same to the County Budget Commissioners or
similar officials. On or before the first (1st) day of February the City
Manager shall submit to the Council an estimate of the expenditures and
revenues of the Municipal departments for the year. This estimate shall be
compiled from the detailed information obtained from the several departments,
on uniform blanks to be furnished by the City Manager and approved by Council
and the Director of Finance shall assist the City Manager in the preparation of
such information. Such information shall be furnished in detail for each
department, and in such form as Council may from time to time require; and
shall contain the recommendations of the City Manager as to the amounts to be
appropriated, with the reasons therefor, in such detail as Council may require.

(11-2-71)
SECTION VII-2. APPROPRIATION ORDINANCE.
   Council shall prepare and adopt an appropriation ordinance, in such manner
and at such time as may be provided by general law, using the City Manager's
estimate as a basis, and such appropriations shall not exceed the estimated
revenues of the Municipality.
SECTION VII-3. TRANSFER OF FUNDS.
   Upon request of the City Manager, Council may transfer any part of an
unencumbered balance of an appropriation to a purpose or object for which the
appropriation for the current year has proved insufficient, or may authorize a
transfer of money to be made between items appropriated to the same office or
department.
SECTION VII-4. UNENCUMBERED BALANCES.
   At the close of each fiscal year, the unencumbered balance of each
appropriation shall revert to the fund from which it was appropriated, and
shall be subject to future appropriation. Any accumulated revenue not
appropriated as hereinbefore provided, and any balances at any time remaining
after the purposes of the appropriation shall have been satisfied or abandoned,
may from time to time be appropriated by Council to such uses as will not
conflict with any uses for which such revenues specifically accrue. No money
shall be drawn from the treasury nor shall any obligation for the expenditure
of money be incurred, except pursuant to appropriations made by Council.
SECTION VII-5. PAYMENT OF CLAIMS.
   No warrant for the payment of any claim shall be issued by the Director of
Finance until such claim shall have been approved by the director of the
department for which indebtedness was incurred and by the City Manager. Such
officers and their sureties shall be liable to the Municipality for any loss or
damage sustained by the Municipality by reason of the corrupt approval of any
such claim against the Municipality. Whenever any claim shall be presented to
the Director of Finance, he shall have power to require evidence that the
amount of the claim is justly due; and for that purpose he may summon before
him any officer, agent or employee of any department of the Municipality, or
any other person, and examine him upon oath or affirmation relative thereto.
(11-2-82; 11-2-10)
SECTION VII-6. CERTIFICATION OF FUNDS.
   No contract, agreement or other obligation involving the expenditure of
money, shall be entered into, nor shall any ordinance, resolution or order for
the expenditure of money be passed or issued by the Council or be authorized by
any officer of the Municipality unless the Director of Finance shall have first
certified in writing to Council, or to the proper officer, as the case may be,
that the money required for such contract, agreement, obligation or expenditure
is in the treasury to the credit of the fund from which it is to be drawn, and
not appropriated for any other purpose, which certificate shall be filed and
immediately recorded. The sum so certified shall not thereafter be considered
unappropriated until the Municipality is discharged from the contract,
agreement or obligation; but the provisions of this section shall not be
construed as prohibiting the making of contracts for the furnishing of services
or of public utilities for a period extending beyond a single fiscal year when
such contracts are otherwise authorized by this Charter or by general law.
SECTION VII-7. MONEY IN THE FUNDS.
   All moneys actually in the treasury to the credit of the fund from which
they are to be drawn, and all moneys applicable to the payment of the
obligation or appropriation involved, that are anticipated to come into the
treasury before the maturity of such contract, agreement or obligation, from
taxes, assessments or license fees, or from sales of service, products or by-
products of any Municipal undertaking, and moneys to be derived from lawfully
authorized bonds, sold and in process of delivery, shall, for the purpose of
such certificate, be deemed to be in the treasury to the credit of the
appropriate fund, and shall be subject to such certification.
SECTION VII-8. BOND ISSUES.
   No bonds or notes of the Municipality shall at any time be issued for
current operating expenses or for acquisition of any property, asset or
improvement of an estimated life or usefulness of less than five years (5 yrs.)
but this prohibition shall not be construed as applying to money borrowed in
anticipation of the collection of special assessments, or for defraying the
expenses of an extraordinary epidemic of disease, or emergency expenses made
necessary by sudden casualty which could not reasonably have been foreseen or
for paying final judgments upon non-contractual obligations.
SECTION VII-9. MATURITIES OF BONDS.
   The maturities of all bonds shall not extend beyond the estimated life of
the property, asset or improvement, as certified to Council by the Director of
Finance, which certificate shall be on file with Council prior to the passage
of any bond ordinance.
(11-5-91)
SECTION VII-10. TEMPORARY LOANS.
   In anticipation of the collection of current revenues in any fiscal year,
the Municipality may borrow money and issue certificates of indebtedness
therefor, signed as municipal bonds are signed, but no such loans shall be made
to exceed the amount estimated to be actually received from taxes or other
current revenues, for such fiscal year, after deducting all advances, nor shall
any such loan be made in anticipation of the February tax settlement before
January 1 of the year of such tax settlement. The sum so anticipated shall be
deemed appropriated for the payment of such certificates at maturity. The
certificates shall not run for a longer period than six months (6 mos.) nor
bear a greater rate of interest than prevailing interest rates and current
market conditions dictate, and shall not be sold for less than the par value
thereof with accrued interest.
(11-2-82)
EDITOR'S NOTE: Article VII, Section 11, Sinking Fund,
was repealed November 2, 1971.
SECTION VII-11. MONTHLY STATEMENT BY DIRECTOR OF FINANCE.
   The Director of Finance shall prepare for submission to Council, not later
than the tenth (l0th) day of each month, a summary statement of revenues and
expenses for the preceding month, detailed as to appropriations and funds in
such manner as to show the exact financial condition of the Municipality and of
each department and office thereof as of the last day of the previous month.
SECTION VII-12. LIMITATION OF THE RATE OF TAXATION.
   The aggregate amount of taxes that may be levied by the taxing authority of
the Municipality without a vote of the people, on any taxable property assessed
and listed for taxation according to value, for all the purposes of the
Municipality, shall not in any one year (1 yr.) exceed ten (10) mills for each
one dollar ($1.00) of assessed valuation. Of said total maximum levy, an amount
shall annually be levied sufficient to pay the interest and retirement charges
on all notes and bonds of the Municipality heretofore or hereafter authorized
to be issued without the authority of the electors, which levy shall be placed
before and in preference to all other levies and for the full amount thereof.
Of the remaining portion of said total maximum levy, an amount shall annually
be levied sufficient to provide the amounts required by law for police pension
and the firemen's indemnity fund; and the balance thereof may annually be
levied for the purpose of paying the current operating expenses of the
Municipality.
(5-2-61; 11-2-82)
SECTION VII-13. OTHER TAXES.
   The limitation of
Section 12 of this Article upon the power of Council to levy taxes shall not
operate as a limitation upon the power of Council to levy taxes upon such other
subjects and for such other purposes as may be lawful under the Constitution
and laws of the State of Ohio, except that Council shall not raise the income
tax in excess of one percent (1%) without a majority vote of the electors.
(11-2-71)
SECTION VII-14. ADDITIONAL LEVIES.
   The authority of Council to submit additional levies to a vote of the people
under the authority of the Constitution or laws of the State of Ohio shall not
be deemed impaired or abridged by reason of any provision of this Charter.
(5-4-54)
SECTION VII-15. TAX LEVY FOR FIRE DEPARTMENT.
   In addition to the power of Council to levy taxes pursuant to the provisions
of
Section 12 of Article VII, the Council may also levy annually, without a vote
of the people, outside of the constitutional and statutory ten-mill limitation
and outside any limitations provided by this Charter, a tax upon all real and
personal property listed and assessed for taxation upon the tax lists and
duplicates beginning with the year 1994 and each year thereafter a tax not to
exceed 2.8 mills for the purpose of paying the costs of capital improvements
and current expenses of the Municipality’s fire department and providing
ambulance, paramedic or other emergency medical services.
(11-8-94)
SECTION VII-16. SAFETY FORCE LEVY.
   In addition to the power of Council to levy taxes pursuant to the provisions
of Section
 12 of this Article VII of the Bedford City Charter, the Council may also levy,
annually, without a vote of the people, outside of the constitutional and
statutory ten-mill limitation and outside any limitations provided by this
Charter, a tax upon all real and personal property listed and assessed for
taxation upon the tax lists and duplicates beginning with tax year 2009, first
collected in 2010 and each year thereafter a tax not to exceed 8.9 mills for
each dollar of assessed valuation for the purpose of paying the costs and
expenses of operating the City's Safety Forces.

ARTICLE VIII
FRANCHISES
SECTION VIII-1. GRANTS.
   Council may, by ordinance, grant permission to any individual, company or
corporation, to construct and operate a public utility in the streets and
public grounds of the Municipality. It may prescribe in the ordinance, the kind
and quality of the service or the product to be furnished, the rate or rates to
be charged therefor, and any terms and conditions conducive to the public
interest, and also the manner in which the streets and public grounds shall be
used and occupied. No such grant shall be made for a longer period than twenty-
five years (25 yrs.). No measure making a grant, renewal or extension of a
franchise or other special privilege, or regulating a rate to be charged for
its service by any public utility, shall ever be passed as an emergency
measure.
SECTION VIII-2. RENEWALS.
   Council may, by ordinance, renew any grant, subject, however, to the
restrictions in
Section 1, for the construction or operation of any utility, at its expiration,
upon such terms as may be conducive to the public interest. No such grant shall
be renewed earlier than two years (2 yrs.) prior to its expiration unless
Council shall, by a vote of at least five (5) of its members, first declare by
ordinance its intention of considering a renewal thereof, which ordinance shall
be passed at least sixty (60) days prior to the passage of the ordinance
granting such renewal.
   All such grants and renewals thereof may reserve to the Municipality the
right to purchase all the property of the utility in the streets and highways
and elsewhere, used in or useful for the purpose of the utility, at a price
either fixed in the ordinance or to be fixed in the manner provided by the
ordinance making the grant or renewal of the grant. Nothing in such ordinance
shall prevent the Municipality from acquiring the property of any such utility
by condemnation proceedings or in any other mode, but all such methods of
acquisition shall be alternative to the power to purchase reserved in the grant
or renewal as hereinbefore provided.
   No ordinance making such purchase shall be valid unless it shall expressly
provide therein that the price to be paid by the Municipality for the property
that may be acquired by it from such utility by purchase, condemnation or
otherwise, shall exclude all value of such grant or renewal.
   Upon the acquisition by the Municipality of the property of any utility by
purchase, condemnation or otherwise, all grants or renewals shall at once
terminate.
SECTION VIII-3. EXTENSION.
   Council may, by ordinance grant to any individual, company or corporation
operating a public utility, the right to extend the appliances and service of
such utility. All such extensions shall become a part of the aggregate property
of the utility and shall be subject to all of the obligations and reserved
rights applicable to the property of the utility by virtue of the ordinance
providing for its construction and operation.
   The right to use and maintain any such extension shall expire with the
original grant of the utility to which the extension was made or any renewal
thereof.
SECTION VIII-4. CONSENTS.
   No consent of the owner of property abutting on any highway or public ground
shall be required for the construction, extension, maintenance or operation of
any public utility by original grant or renewal, unless such public utility is
of such a character that its construction or operation is an additional burden
upon the rights of the property owners in such highways or public grounds.
SECTION VIII-5. REGULATIONS.
   All rights granted for the construction and operation of public utilities in
the Municipality shall be subject to the continuing right of Council to require
such reconstruction, relocation, change or discontinuance of the appliances
used by the utility in the streets, alleys, avenues and public grounds of the
Municipality as shall, in the opinion of Council, be necessary in the public
interest.
   In ordering any such reconstruction, relocation, change or discontinuance,
Council shall, by ordinance, provide for such alterations in the rates for
service and in the terms upon which purchase is authorized to be made by the
Municipality as shall be necessary or equitable to protect the owner of the
utility against loss of property value.
ARTICLE IX
PLANNING COMMISSION AND BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS
SECTION IX-1. ESTABLISHMENT.
   Council shall, within ninety days following January 1, 1932, establish by

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the Municipality,
any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or a
misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the failure to do
any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided, the
violation of any such provision shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding
five hundred dollars ($500.00), or by imprisonment not exceeding six months (6
mos.), or both. Any such violation shall constitute a separate offense on each
successive day continued.

104.01 CONTRACT PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Proper Authorization. No contract, or an amendment or a change order
to a contract, shall be enforceable against the City unless it has been duly
authorized, as provided for herein, and executed in the name of the City by the
City Manager and bears the signature of the Finance Director of the City, to
the extent required by the Ohio Revised Code, certifying the availability and
appropriation of funds for the contract or any amendment or change order to the

authority to investigate costs relative to any proposed public improvement or
any proposed purchase or lease of equipment, supplies, services or materials.
   (c)   Authorization for Design and/or Specifications. In the event the
investigation or a good faith estimate by the City Manager indicates that the
cost of a proposed project, purchase, lease or provision of services will
exceed the amount specified in section 9.17 of the Ohio Revised Code (ORC)
(starting at $75,000 on October 3, 2023 through December 31, 2024 thereafter

   (d)   Public Bidding. Except as provided in subsection (e), any contract
which: (I) provides for an expenditure in excess of the amount specified in
section 9.17 ORC (starting at $75,000 on October 3, 2023 through December 31,
2024 thereafter subject to any increases specified by section 9.17 ORC); and,
(ii) is for the construction of a public improvement or the purchase or lease
of equipment, supplies or materials, or the provision of a service to the City,
shall be authorized only upon a motion, adopted by a majority vote of the
members of Council, to award the contract to the lowest and best bidder after
advertising for a time and in a manner that the City determines shall be
effective in notifying a sufficient number of bidders as determined by the City
in its discretion. By way of example, and not as a limitation, the
advertisement may be in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, or
publication on the City's website, or both.
     (e) Exceptions to Public Bidding. Contracts whose costs are estimated to
exceed the amount specified in section 9.17 ORC (starting at $75,000 on October
3, 2023 through December 31, 202 thereafter subject to any increases specified
by section 9.17 ORC) and that meet the following conditions are not subject to
competitive bidding and may be approved by Council, in its discretion, by
motion and a majority vote of its members:
      (1)   Personal or professional services. Except as provided in Section
104.02 contracts that involve personal services requiring unique and special
skills, as determined by Council in its discretion, or professional services;
      (2)   Coop programs. Contracts authorized pursuant to the Ohio Department
of Administrative Services Cooperative Purchasing Program, or any other similar
program ("cooperative program"), or goods, materials or equipment which are
available under a cooperative program but are available to the City upon
equivalent or better conditions and specification, but at a lower price than is
available, under a cooperative program;
      (3)   Design build. The proposed purchase is a Design-Build Construction
project let under the procedures established by Council;
      (4)   Construction-manager-at-risk. The proposed purchase is a
Construction- Manager-at-Risk project let under the procedures established by
Council.
      (5)   Single source. The proposed purchase is for something that, as
determined at the sole-discretion of the Council, is only available from a
single source;
      (6)   No bids/rejected bids. If no bids are received after the
advertisements or other solicitations required by this Ordinance, or if all
bids are rejected, the City Manager shall either seek new, competitive bids, or
seek to obtain the goods and/or services for which funds have been appropriated
without a re- bidding, which is deemed to be in the best interest of the City;
      (7)   Used equipment. The proposed purchase is for used equipment;
      (8)   Utility. The proposed purchase is for utilities such as gas, water,
electricity, or telephone service for which funds have been appropriated;
notwithstanding other provisions of this section, Council shall authorize such
purchases pursuant to an ordinance.
      (9)   Intergovernmental purchases. The proposed purchase is from or with
another political subdivision, the Ohio State Government, or the United States
Government;
      (10)   Reverse auction. The proposed purchase is obtained through Reverse
Auction;
      (11)   Best interest waiver. Council may, at its sole discretion, waive
the public bidding requirement if it determines that doing so is in the best
interest of the City.
   (f)   City Manager's Discretionary Spending Authority. The City Manager may
expend up to fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), in accordance with the City's
current appropriations, for any public improvement, or the purchase or lease of
equipment, materials and supplies, or to obtain professional or personal
services or for any other lawful purpose. The City Manager shall notify Council
of such expenditure at the next meeting of Council.
   (g)    City Manager's Conditional Spending Authority. The City Manager may
make an expenditure which is between fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) and the
amount specified in section 9.17 ORC (starting at $75,000 on October 3, 2023
through December 31, 202 thereafter subject to any increases specified by
section 9.17 ORC) upon the prior approval of four members of Council, which
approval may be made in writing or by a motion and vote at any regular or
special meeting of Council. Authorization provided by Council in writing shall
only be effective if all members of Council are sent a written explanation of
the amount and purpose of the proposed expenditure, and the reason for the
necessity of action prior to the next meeting of Council. Further, all written
authorizations for such expenditures shall be announced at the next regular or
special meeting of Council by the City Manager, and such announcement shall
include a report of how the members of Council were notified in writing and the
reason why immediate action was necessary.
   (h)   Real Estate. The City Manager may purchase, sell or lease real
property valued below twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), provided that a
current appropriation supports any such purchase or lease of real estate and
provided that Council is notified of such purchase, sale or lease at the time
of the next Council meeting (including any work session). The Council may, by
ordinance, provide for the purchase, sale or lease of real property, valued at
or in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), with or without public
bidding, on such terms and for such value as Council, in the exercise of its
discretion, may deem reasonable and in the best interest of the City.
   (i)   Time Between Notice of Public Bidding and Bid Opening. There shall be
no minimum time requirements between the publishing of the notice of public
bidding and the opening of the bids.
   (j)   Estimate of Cost. The City shall disclose the estimated cost of the
project when it determines that doing so is in its best interest.
   (k)   Time for Award of Bids. In the notice of public bidding required for
the bid solicitation, the City shall establish the time limit after bid
submission for awarding a contract. Submitted bids may not be withdrawn during
this period. The City's failure to award and execute the contract within this
period invalidates the entire bid proceedings and all bids submitted, unless
the time for awarding and executing the contract is extended by mutual consent
of the City and the bidder whose bid the City accepts and with respect to whom
the City subsequently awards and executes a contract. Such an agreed extension
shall not entitle the contractor to delay costs.
   (l)    Withdrawal of Bids. Bidders may withdraw bids pursuant to Section
9.31 of the Ohio Revised Code; such a withdrawal shall not modify the City's
right to award to the next lowest and best bidder.
   (m)    Bids in Excess of Estimate. The City may award contracts regardless
of the amount of the bid as compared to the estimated cost.
   (n)   Notice to Proceed. The contractor is not entitled to a notice to
proceed with the work by the City or its representative upon execution of the
contract. The City shall either issue the notice to proceed at a time that it
determines is in its best interest, or it shall terminate the contract for its
convenience.
   (o)   Retainage. Retainage shall be withheld from payments to the contractor
at the rate set forth in the Owner/Contractor agreement. Retainage shall not be
held in an escrow account. Retainage shall be released at such times and in
such amounts as the City determines to be equitable.
   (p)   General Contractor Permitted. The City may advertise and award a
single contract for constructing and managing an entire public improvement
project.
   (q)   Extension of Bid Opening. The City may issue an addendum or addenda
modifying the plans and specifications for the project or the time for the bid
opening at any time prior to the bid opening. If an addendum is issued within
forty-eight hours before the bid opening, the bid opening shall be extended by
at least three days.
   (r)   Combined Statement of Material and Labor. The City at its discretion
may accept a combined statement of labor and materials from bidders.
   (s)   Bonus and Liquidated Damages for Time. The City may offer a bonus for
completion of a contract prior to a specified date or may exact liquidated
damages for each day of delay beyond a specified date, or both. The amounts of
the bonus and liquidated damages may be different. (Ord. 9590-18. Passed 4-16-

123.01 ORGANIZATION; PROCEDURE.
   At 8:00 p.m. on January 2 following each Municipal election, unless the
second is a Sunday or a holiday, on the following day, Council shall meet at
City Hall and organize and elect one (1) of its members as Vice Mayor, who
shall serve for a period of two years (2 yrs.) thereafter. If five (5) members
agree, the meeting may commence at 7:00 p.m. The Mayor shall preside at all
meetings of Council and shall have a voice and vote in all its proceedings, but
no veto. He shall preserve order and decorum, prevent personal reflection and
confine members in debate to the question. He may, in common with any other
member, call any member to order who shall violate any of the rules and shall,
when in the chair, decide all questions of order subject to the appeal of
Council on demand of two (2) members. On such appeal there shall be no debate,
but each member making the appeal may briefly state his reason for the same and
the presiding officer shall have the same right to a similar brief statement.
In the absence of the Mayor, the Vice Mayor shall discharge the duties and be
clothed with all the powers of the Mayor. In the absence of both the Mayor and
the Vice Mayor, the Councilmen present may choose one (1) of their members as
Mayor pro tempore, who, during such absence, shall discharge the duties and be
clothed with all the powers of the Mayor.

   Four (4) members shall constitute a quorum to do business and a less number
may adjourn from day to day and compel the attendance of absent members in such
manner and under such penalties as may be prescribed by ordinance. Should any
member of Council be absent from as many as four (4) consecutive regular
meetings, he shall thereby forfeit his seat in Council, unless such absence is
authorized and excused by Council.
(Ord. 1-32. Passed 1-2-32)
123.03 VOTING.
Every member shall vote on any question on the call of the ayes and nays unless

and nays are being taken shall be counted as voting in the affirmative.
(Ord. 1-32. Passed 1-2-32)
123.04 REMOVAL.
Council shall be the judge of the election and qualifications of its own
members. It may expel any member for gross misconduct or malfeasance in or
disqualification for office, or for conviction of a crime involving moral
turpitude while in office, violation of the
Charter or persistent failure to abide by the rules of Council. However, such
expulsion shall not take place without the concurrence of five (5) members nor
until the accused member shall have been notified of the charge against him and
given an opportunity to be heard.
(Ord. 1-32. Passed 1-2-32)

or officer or employee is or becomes interested may be void by Council. Nor
shall the Mayor or members of Council, or directors of departments, during
their terms of office, nor any other employee of the Municipality, during his
employment by the Municipality, practice law or give legal advice or be
associated with another in the practice of law in any manner, matter or
controversy in which the Municipality is or may become a party, except on
behalf of the Municipality as an officer or employee. Any willful violation of
this section shall constitute malfeasance in office, and any such officer or
employee found guilty thereof under the terms of the
Charter or under the provisions of the general law shall forthwith forfeit his
office, and the office shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of the
Charter as to vacancies.
   All complaints of conflict of interest shall be made in writing in affidavit

person so accused is an employee of the City, the City Manager shall cause a
copy of the complaint to be served upon the accused and a copy to the Civil

and take such disciplinary action as the case may require. If the accused is an
elected or appointed official of the City, the City Manager or Clerk of Council
shall cause facsimile copies of the complaint to be distributed to members of
Council and to the Law Director, with a copy to the accused. Council shall,
within thirty (30) days, conduct a preliminary hearing, in private, to
determine whether there exists a probable cause to believe that the charges
against the accused are true. If Council, by a three-fourths (3/4) margin,
shall decide that there exists probable cause to believe the charges are true
and are supported by reasonable and credible evidence, after giving the accused
a full opportunity to be heard in reply, shall take such action as the law
permits, depending upon the circumstances of the case, to enforce the
Charter and ordinances of the City and the laws of the State of Ohio relating
to conflict of interest. Council shall, at the next regular Council meeting
following such affirmative vote finding the probability of conflict of
interest, make such notation, recommendation, resolution or ordinances as they
shall desire at the Council meeting and have the same recorded upon the
minutes. If Council shall not find the probability of a conflict of interest by
such vote, then the accusation shall not be made public. During the pendency of
such proceedings and unless and until the matter be recorded upon the minutes
of Council during a regular meeting, no person shall cause to be made public
any of the charges, replies or information obtained for or against the accused
nor shall they invade the privacy of the accused pending a full and final
determination by Council, except as otherwise provided by State law.
   The willful and intentional violation of this section is hereby declared to
be unlawful and upon conviction, the accused shall be found guilty of a
misdemeanor. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the accused from being
prosecuted under any other provision of State law.

151.03 APPLICATION OF COMPENSATION PLAN.
   (a)   Entrance Salary Rates.
      (1)   Starting rate on initial employment. Original appointment to any
position shall be made within the beginning range. Upon recommendation of the
Department Head, the City Manager may approve initial compensation at a rate
within the beginning range when the needs of the service make such action
necessary, provided that any such exception is based on the outstanding and
unusual character of the employee's experience and ability over and above the
minimum qualifications specified for the class. Original appointment of
Department Heads, Finance Director or City Manager may be at a rate within the
beginning range depending upon the employee's experience and ability over and
above the minimum requirements for the position.
      (2)   Starting rate on return to duty.  When an employee returns to duty
in the same class or position after a separation from the City service of not
more than one year (1 year), which separation was not due to discreditable
circumstances, such employee shall receive the rate in the compensation
schedule corresponding to the rate received at the time of separation and shall
subsequently serve thereat for such period of time as is normally required for
advancement within the schedule
      (3)   Starting rate on return from military service.  Any employee who
leaves or has left the City service to enter the active service of the armed
forces of the United States, and who subsequently is reinstated to a position
previously held, shall be entitled to receive a compensation at the rate
applicable had not the service with the City been interrupted by service in the
armed forces.
      (4)   Starting rate in new position. Whenever an employee is assigned to
duty in a position not previously held and such change is not in the nature of
a promotion, the employee shall be entitled to the entrance rate in the
schedule established for such position or other rate within the applicable
schedule by reason of crediting in the new position with such prior service
that is found to meet the following conditions: the character and nature of the
duties of the position to which the employee was assigned are similar to those
of the new position; the service in the former position provided experience
valuable to the performance of the new position.
      (5)   Rate of pay on promotion. In any case where an employee is promoted
to a class with a higher compensation schedule, the entrance rate shall be the
employee's current rate of pay during the 60 day probationary period.
Subsequent advancement within the schedule will be on the same basis as
described in subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   Advancement within Compensation Schedule for Administrative, Technical
and Advanced Clerical Positions.
      (1)   At the completion of six months (6 months) and thereafter at yearly
intervals on January 1, a full-time employee shall be eligible for advancement
to a higher rate within the appropriate salary level of the position occupied
by the employee on the first (1st) day of the next succeeding pay period;
except that the above shall not be construed to limit the movement by an
employee at a rate deemed appropriate by the City Council upon recommendation
by the City Manager.
The City Manager may perform an evaluation at any time for employees whose
yearly evaluation does not result in an increased rate. Upon completion of an
acceptable evaluation, the City Manager may recommend to City Council
thereafter an increase in the rate of pay. The recommendation shall when
practical, be in writing and the advancement based on a written performance
evaluation of the employee.
      (2)   Advancement at the salary level shall be in increments of 4 percent
or less and no employee shall be eligible for advancement unless recommended
for an increase by the Department Head concerned or the City Manager, except in
those instances of employees who report to the City Council. Department Heads
may progress at a rate approved by City Council upon recommendation of the City
Manager. Council shall establish the rates of pay for the City Manager, Finance
Director, Law Director, Assistant Law Director and Clerk of Council by a letter
signed by the Mayor and filed with the Finance Director.
      (3)   Any permanent part-time employee, regularly employed on a
continuing work schedule, shall be evaluated by January 1 of each year
succeeding the employee's first date of employment to be eligible for
advancement within the schedule; except that the above shall not be construed
to limit the City Manager to move an employee through the compensation schedule
at a rate deemed appropriate. Advancement will be on the first day of the next
succeeding pay period.
      (4)   The City Manager, with City Council approval, may grant an increase
of up to 4 percent of the yearly rate of pay for achievement by an employee of
exceptional performance. The duration of the increase shall not exceed one
year. At the discretion of the City Manager, the top performance rate may be
given in one sum at a time deemed appropriate by the City Manager.
      (5)   Employees in Levels I through VIII may receive an inflationary rate
increase upon consultation by the City Manager with the City Council as to the
maximum amount of percentage that may be granted for inflation. Employees in
Levels IX and X and employees reporting to the Building Commissioner shall
receive the annual inflationary rate increase granted other clerical positions
as a result of collective bargaining agreements.
(Ord. 8923-12. Passed 2-21-12; Ord. 018-24. Passed 3-18-24.)
   (c)   Requirements as to Continuity of Service. Service requirements for
advancement within compensation schedules and for other purposes as specified
in this Chapter shall have the implication of continuous service, which means
employment in the City service without break or interruption. Leaves of absence
with pay and leaves without pay of less than thirty days shall not interrupt
continuous service or be deducted therefrom. Absences on leave without pay in
excess of thirty days, except for extended service with the armed services of
the United States, shall be deducted in computing total service but shall not
serve to interrupt continuous service. In case of repeated one-day absence
without leave, the City Manager may consider the service of the employee
interrupted and shall have the record of the employee show the same.

such taxpayer and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax; provided that in the case of commercial property, the owner shall be

income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a municipal income
tax return. The taxpayer shall make the request by filing a copy of the
taxpayer’s request for a federal filing extension with the individual or office
charged with the administration of the municipal income tax. The request for
extension shall be filed not later than the last day for filing the municipal
income tax return as prescribed by Section
167.02 hereof. The Administrator shall grant such a request for extension filed
before January 1, 2004 for a period not less than the period of the federal
extension request. For taxable years beginning after 2003, the extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the last day of the month
following the month to which the due date of the federal income tax return has
been extended. The Administrator may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension
only if the taxpayer fails to timely file the request, fails to file a copy of
the request for the federal extension, owes the City any delinquent income tax
or any penalty, interest, assessment, or other charge for the late payment or
nonpayment of income tax, or has failed to file any required income tax return,
report, or other related document for a prior tax period. The granting of an
extension for filing a City income tax return does not extend the last date for
paying the tax without penalty unless the Administrator grants an extension of
that date with separate written evidence of the extension of such payment date.
No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and
the final tax paid not later than the last day of the extended period.
   (b)   Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this Section
167.04, on and after January 1, 2005, any taxpayer that is subject to the
City’s municipal income tax on the net profit from a business or profession and
has received an extension to file the federal income tax return shall not be
required to notify the Administrator of the federal extension and shall not be
required to file any municipal income tax return until the last day of the
month to which the due date for filing the federal return has been extended,
provided that, on or before the date for filing the municipal income tax
return, the person notifies the tax commissioner of the federal extension
through the
   (c)   Ohio business gateway. An extension of time to file is not an
extension of the time to pay any tax due.
   (d)   In addition to the procedures set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
this section regarding a taxpayer’s written request for or electronic
notification concerning an extension of the date for filing a municipal income
tax return, the Administrator is authorized to implement in his sole discretion
procedures, including, but not limited to, written rules and regulations, that
would permit a taxpayer to request by telephone an extension of the date for
filing a municipal income tax return. If the Administrator implements said
procedures, any taxpayer that has requested by telephone or in writing an
extension of the federal filing deadline may request by telephone an extension
of the date for filing a municipal income tax return; and the provisions
contained in the preceding paragraph (a) regarding (A) the taxpayer’s having
requested an extension of the filing date for such taxpayer’s federal income
tax return, (B) the period within which such extensions must be requested, (C)
the period for which the extension shall be granted by the Administrator and
(D) the reasons for which the Administrator may deny a taxpayer’s request for
extension shall all likewise be applicable to a taxpayer’s telephonic request
for an extension of the date for filing a municipal income tax return.

accordance with Rules and Regulations prescribed by the Administrator.

stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in the case any person
operates a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the
City constituting a portion only of its total business, the Administrator shall
require such additional information as he may deem necessary to ascertain
whether net profits are properly allocated to the City. If the Administrator
finds that net profits are not properly allocated to the City by reason of
transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity or by some other method, he
shall make such allocation as he deems appropriate to produce a fair and proper
allocation of net profits to the City.
   (c)   On and after January 1, 2003, if the City at the time imposes a tax on
the income or net profits of corporations, the Administrator shall accept for
filing a consolidated income tax return from any affiliated group of
corporations subject to the City’s income tax if that affiliated group filed
for the same tax reporting period a consolidated return for federal income tax

173.01 UNPAID TAXES RECOVERABLE AS OTHER DEBTS.
All taxes imposed by this
Title shall be collectible, together with any interest and penalties thereon,
by suit, as other debts of like amount are recoverable. Except in the case of
fraud, of omission of a substantial portion of income subject to this tax or of
failure to file a return, an additional assessment shall not be made after

   (a)   Claims for refund of City income taxes paid in excess of the amount or

(Ord. 7464-02. Passed 5-6-02.)
 
   173.021 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSSES ON NON- QUALIFIED DEFERRED
COMPENSATION PLANS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” has the same meaning as
established at Section
161.121 of this Title Nine.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in subsection (a)(2)B. hereof, “qualifying
loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation, the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized for federal
income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as compensation
with respect to the taxpayer’s receipt of money and property attributable to
distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
the City or any other municipal corporation income tax imposed on the entire
amount of compensation, the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the
product of the amount resulting from the calculation described in subsection
(a)(2)A. hereof computed without regard to subsection (a)(2)B. hereof and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to the City or any other municipal corporation
and the denominator of which is the total amount of compensation, the payment
of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to the City with respect to any
portion of the total amount of compensation, the payment of which is deferred
pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different tax rates
applied for different taxable years, then the “qualifying tax rate” is a
weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall be
based upon the tax paid to the City each year with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (d) hereof, a refundable credit
shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by the City for each qualifying
loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable year. The amount of the credit
shall be equal to the product of the qualifying loss and the qualifying tax
rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this Section from
the City and each additional municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid
municipal income tax with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan in one or more taxable years.

corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (4)   With respect to a refund under this Section paid by the city, in no

years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.

for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the City by the
taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this Section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

(Ord. 8497-09. Passed 10-5-09.)

    (a)   In the event that, in spite of reasonable efforts by the
Administrator to secure from a taxpayer payment of all or a portion of such
taxpayer’s delinquent taxes, penalties and interest, such delinquent taxes,
penalties and interest, or any portion thereof, remain unpaid after a period of
at least thirty-six months commencing on, and including, the date on which such
taxes first became delinquent, then, provided that the aggregate of such
delinquent taxes, penalties and interest due from such taxpayer at the end of
such thirty-six month period are less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) and
that such taxpayer has made no payment during the period following such thirty-
six month period up to and including the date of the Administrator’s written
request to the Board of Review pursuant to this paragraph (a), the
Administrator may, by written request to the Board of Review any time after the
end of such thirty-six month period, ask the approval of the Board of Review
that such delinquent taxes, penalties and interest be written-off the records
of the City and that their collection no longer be pursued.
   (b)   In the event of a request from the Administrator pursuant to paragraph
(a) of this Section, such request from the Administrator shall describe in
summary form, in addition to all pertinent information regarding the amount of
such delinquent taxes, penalties and interest, the reasonable efforts taken by
the Administrator to attempt to collect such delinquent taxes, penalties and
interest. If, after all other conditions of this Section
173.04 have been satisfied, the Board of Review approves the Administrator’s
request regarding the write-off of such taxes, penalties and interest, the
Administrator, by journal entry with evidence of the Board’s approval affixed
thereto, shall write-off such taxes, penalties and interest from the income tax
records of the City, and thereupon such taxes, penalties and interest shall no
longer be due and payable to the City.
   (c)   In addition to the request to write-off delinquent taxes, penalties
and interest authorized in the preceding paragraph (a), if the delinquent
taxes, penalties and interest, or any portion thereof, due to the City from a
taxpayer are, or are declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be,
uncollectible as a matter of law due to a statute of limitations or otherwise,
the Administrator may, at any time after such delinquent taxes, penalties and
interest are, or have been declared to be, uncollectible as a matter of law, in
a written direction, cause such delinquent taxes, penalties and interest to be
written-off the records of the City and their collection to no longer be
pursued. The Administrator shall give notice to the Board of Review of any
action taken pursuant to this paragraph (c) within ten (10) business days after
taking such action. Such notice shall describe in summary form, in addition to
the amount of such delinquent taxes, penalties and interest being written-off,
the reason such delinquent taxes, penalties and interest are uncollectible as a
matter of law.

175.01 TAX CREDIT.
   (a)   When a resident of the City is subject to a municipal income tax in
another municipality on the same income taxable under this
Title, such resident may claim a credit of the amount of income tax paid to the
other municipality, but not in excess of one hundred percent (100%) of the
first 1.50% of the income tax liability under this
Title. When a resident of the City works in a joint economic development zone
created under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created
under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Revised Code, such resident may
claim a credit of the amount of income tax paid to the joint economic
development zone or joint economic development district, as applicable, but not
in excess of one hundred percent (100%) of the first 1.50% of the income tax
liability under this
Title. This credit shall be calculated separately for each income source. This
provision shall be effective on all taxable income earned on and after January
1, 2001.
(Ord. 7464-02. Passed 5-6-02.)
   (b)   A claim for credit or refund under this section shall be made in such
manner as the Administrator may by Regulation provide. In the event such City
resident fails, neglects or refuses to file an annual return or declaration on
the form prescribed by the Administrator, he shall not be entitled to such
credit or refund and shall be considered in violation of this
Title for failure to file a return.
 
   (c)   In the event a City resident is entitled to a reciprocity credit under
the ordinance of another municipality or is entitled to credit for taxes paid
another municipality or is entitled to credit for taxes paid to either
municipality, such City resident is required to file a return or form in such
manner as the Administrator designated by the City may prescribe.
Assignment of any claim for refund to which a City resident may be entitled
from another municipality shall be tentatively accepted as payment of that
portion of City income tax represented by such assignment. Provided, however,
if satisfactory evidence is offered that the taxpayer is entitled to the claim
covered by the assignment, such taxpayer shall not be deprived of credit
therefor because of fault or neglect on the part of either municipality.
In the event such City resident fails, neglects or refuses to file such return
or form as is prescribed by the Administrator, he shall not be entitled to such
credit and shall be considered in violation of this
Title for failure to file a return and make payment of taxes due hereunder.

payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "Municipal

and (B) the employer of such nonresidential taxpayer maintains a place of
business within the City from which the nonresident taxpayer could do such work

demonstrating that the decision of a nonresident taxpayer to do such work or to
perform or render services from such nonresidents taxpayers residence either
(1) is not at the discretion of such taxpayer and is a condition of employment
for such nonresident taxpayer or (2) is caused by reason of permanent
disability or child care or eldercare, the Tax Administrator shall treat the
work done or services performed or rendered by the nonresident taxpayer from
such taxpayer's residence as work done or services performed or rendered within
the City.

            (i)   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in section
178.051 of this Chapter.

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent

         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick

(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
178.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of section
178.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum

corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the

personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.

   178.06 INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
 
   178.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, not further reduced by any "Pre-2017

      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer.
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
178.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.

include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

apportionment factors or claims zero, the factor is not to be included in the
calculation. (Ord. 9567-18. Passed 2-20-18.)
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the

         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
178.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
178.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:

under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the

corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
   A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions

to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit
that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount other than the
amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount
related to the stock option not exempted (stock options are not exempted for
calculation of City of Bedford Tax) from taxation. This division applies solely
for the purpose of making an adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's net
profit that was apportioned to a municipal corporation under this section.

      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return

computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,

for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
178.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit

the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
178.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
178.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in

following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid

      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.

may claim a credit of the amount of income tax paid to the other municipality,
but not in excess of one hundred percent (100%) of the first 2.25% of the
income tax liability under this Title and no more credit is allowed for
refunds, than the amount that is paid in taxes to the Resident City.

"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different

is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation. (Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)

178.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
178.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.

the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any other
documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments made
in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
178.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
178.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
178.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
178.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in section
178.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in section
178.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person.
            (Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   178.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C) (2)
(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C) (2) (a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C) (2) (a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)   For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   178.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax.
   (F)   Business entities may file centralized municipal net profits tax
refunds and collection through the Gateway of Ohio pursuant to HB 49
requirements, pending outcome of lawsuit and court ruling. (Ord. 9567-18.

178.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return. (Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   178.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B) (2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
section
178.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of section
178.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C) (2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section
178.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
178.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
178.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
178.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in

   (H)   Order of application of any payments for accounts administered by the
Municipality.
      (1)   On accounts administered by the Municipality, upon payment by
taxpayer towards any taxes, collection costs, collection fees, (including
attorney fees), penalties and interest, these payment(s) will be applied first
to the oldest tax year account balance, and shall be applied to the order of
application of the payment(s) as follows:
         First apply payment to any Municipality's post-judgment collection
costs and fees, including attorney's fees, then apply remaining payment(s) to
penalties and interest, and finally to the delinquent principal tax balance.

178.11 AUDIT.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, as defined in Section
178.03(3) of this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer
a written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right
to obtain a refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of
an audit, the Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

178.12 ROUNDING.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)

records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax

Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
   (I)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding

      (Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   178.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (D)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement. (Ord. 9317-15. Passed
11-16-15.)
   178.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   178.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to section
178.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
section
178.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to section
178.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B) (1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in section
178.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
178.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
178.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   178.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   178.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a Request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
178.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
178.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B) (1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
   178.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
   The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A) (4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   A member of the Local Board of Tax Review may not receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for services on this board.
      (9)   A member of the Local Board of Tax Review may be appointed to serve
on another such board simultaneously.
    These appointments both by the appointing authority and City Council, must
be in the form of a resolution passed by Council.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 9317-15. Passed 11-16-15.)
178.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
178.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
178.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section

person having the right to the possession of the property. The chief, upon
complaint of a repair garage or place of storage, may order into storage any
motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk motor vehicle, that has been left

this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that division.
The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location designated
by the chief not more than two hours after the time it is removed from the
private property, unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor
vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or
other event that is not within the power of the towing service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to

the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.

was removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the
person from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it
has been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under division (a)
(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the
towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle shall give the
owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.

include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),

more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender

      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
         If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the
violation and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars
($100.00), the court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the
additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender
instead may elect to attend the distracted driving safety course described in
subsection (b)(1) of this section. If the offender elects the course option and
attends and successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued
written evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The
offender shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for
the violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted

thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or

from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:

the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to

intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed

fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician,
chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and (d)(4)C. of this section,
“National Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or (d)(4)B.2. of this section and if the testimony or
evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   Laboratory Report.
      (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   Limitation of Liability.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. § 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or R.C. § 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
         (R.C. § 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions. For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.” Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control.” Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   Tests at request of law enforcement agent. The chemical test or
tests under division (g)(2) of this section shall be administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the
person was operating or in physical control of a vehicle in violation of a
division, section or ordinance identified in division (g)(2) of this section.
The law enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate
which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to R.C. §§
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
            (R.C. § 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
            “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
state law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
            “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
            (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) “If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
            “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical
test taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person’s initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
      (9)   Duties of officer.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person’s refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s license or permit or it is not in the
person’s vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. §
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer’s sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first-class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest, provided
the report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is
sworn to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48
hours after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy
of the sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on
the charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197
relative to any suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the
arrest covered by the report.
            (R.C. § 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person’s
driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B),
or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control of a
vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or
R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the charge resulting from
the arrest shall be held within five days of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance granted by
the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the issues specified in that
section.
         (R.C. § 4511.191(D))
   (h)   Penalty for Driving Under the Influence.
      (1)   Whoever violates any provisions of divisions (a)(1)A. through (a)
(1)I. or (a)(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever
violates division (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle
while under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for
either offense under R.C. Chapter 2929, except as otherwise authorized or
required by divisions (h)(1)A. through (h)(1)E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)B., (h)(1)C., (h)
(1)D. or (h)(1)E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the first degree and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the
penalties and sanctions provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(a)(i) to (G)(1)(a)
(iv).
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of division (a) of this
section, or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the penalties and
sanctions provided in R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) to (G)(1)(b)(v).
         C.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two violations of division (a) of this
section or other equivalent offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court
shall sentence the offender to all of the penalties and sanctions provided in

this section or other equivalent offenses or an offender who, within 20 years
of the offense, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to five or
more violations of that nature, or an offender who previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to a specification of the type described in R.C.
§ 2941.1413, is guilty of a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state
law.
         E.   An offender who previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) that was a felony, regardless of
when the violation and the conviction or guilty plea occurred, is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver’s or occupational driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 as a result of the
conviction or guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in R.C. §
4511.191(F)(2).
      (3)   A.   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under R.C. §
4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (G)(1)(b)(ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (G)(1)(c)(ii) and if,
within 60 days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. §
4511.19(G)(3) that includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring,
with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by R.C.
§ 4511.19(G)(1), the court may sentence the offender as provided in R.C. §

      (4)   If an offender’s driver’s or occupational driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (h) of
this section or R.C. § 4511.19(G) and if R.C. § 4510.13 permits the court to
grant limited driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving
privileges in accordance with that section. If division (A)(7) of that section
requires the court impose as a condition of the privileges that the offender
must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under R.C. § 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in R.C. § 4503.231(B).

driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended
under this section or R.C. § 4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of
the person’s trial or sentence, the appeal itself does not stay the operation
of the suspension.

section does not apply to a person who operates a vehicle while the person has
a concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a

this section. If the meaning of a term defined in R.C. § 4510.01 conflicts with

officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:

court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (o)(3)A. of this section.

the school zone speed limit is in effect.
         B.   As used in this section, “school” means all of the following:
            1.    Any school chartered under Ohio R.C. 3301.16;

portion of a State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet

established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities and
it is unlawful for any person to exceed any of the speed limitations in

shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with R.C. § 4511.98,
the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall impose
upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the violation

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for purposes of enforcing this section

either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for

   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected or believed to have
occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 2935.01.
   (l)   (1)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section that
took effect on July 16, 2015, apply to a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03
committed on and after July 16, 2015, and apply to a violation of either of
those sections committed prior to July 16, 2015, if prosecution for that
violation was not barred under this section as it existed on July 16, 2015.
      (2)   The amendment to division (a)(2) of this section that took effect
on April 4, 2023, applies to a conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or
complicity in committing a violation of R.C. § 2903.01 or R.C. § 2903.02 if the
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity is committed on or after April 4, 2023, and

committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it
existed on the day prior to April 4, 2023.
(R.C. § 2901.13)
   (m)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24; Ord. 4128-74. Passed 1-7-74)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
R.C. § 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor, including a minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any
financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions authorized under this
division (a) and, if the offender is being sentenced for a criminal offense as
defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall sentence the offender to make restitution
pursuant to this division (a) and R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its
discretion or as required by this division (a), imposes one or more financial
sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this
division (a) include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Restitution.
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this division (a) in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
(ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5)
of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to
law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,

   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.

545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

      (3)   This section does not apply to obstruction of a public street, road

act.

greater, for the missed appointment, except where the delay is occasioned by an
Act of God, strike, national emergency or any other circumstance beyond the
control of the Provider.
      (7)   If Provider fails to correct a service problem [other than a
service interruption which is governed by paragraphs (8) and (9) of this

charge for the affected tier or premium channel to the subscriber for each
twenty-four (24) hours or fraction thereof after the first twenty four (24)
hours during which a subscriber is with reduced service. The credit shall be
made automatically by Provider without requiring subscriber request. Provider

this Section, inform the Commission regarding the disposition of all credits
provided by Grantee to subscribers pursuant to this paragraph (7).

      (2)   If a Provider representative is running late for an appointment
with a subscriber and will not be able to keep the appointment as scheduled,
the subscriber shall be contacted. The appointment shall be rescheduled, as
necessary, at a time which is convenient to the customer. Should a Provider's
representative miss an installation appointment, or fail to provide the
subscriber the advance notice of a cancellation required in this paragraph, the

$20.00, whichever is greater, for the missed appointment, except where the
delay is occasioned by an Act of God, strike, national emergency or any other
circumstance beyond the control of the Provider.
      (3)   If a customer requests a nonstandard customer installation, the

estimate, not to be exceeded without the customer's written consent, and an

      (1)   The City hereby adopts and shall follow the rules relating to cable
rate regulation promulgated by the FCC at 47 C.F.R., Part 76.900, Subpart N.
Prior to approving or disapproving any rates, the City shall provide an
opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties.
      (2)   Within thirty days after receipt of a notice from the City of the
City's certification by the FCC to regulate rates, the Provider shall have
thirty days to respond with rate and benchmark information to justify its
initial benchmark rate and any subsequent increases that took place leading to
the rate current at the time of the City's certification utilizing the
appropriate official FCC form(s).
      (3)   Provider shall file all rate justifications subsequent to the
City's certification within the time frames provided by FCC regulations for the
given type of FCC filing or cost-of-service showing submitted by the Provider.

determined to be within the FCC's standards, may take effect pursuant to the
time frames provided for in the FCC's regulations.
      (5)   The City shall conduct its evaluation of whether the proposed rate
at issue is appropriate pursuant to FCC regulations and may avail itself of
whatever additional periods of time that are permitted by the FCC and that are
necessary to complete that evaluation.
      (6)   The City shall, in all cases, issue a written decision to approve
the proposed rates and charges, disapprove the proposed rates and charges or to
continue its review pursuant to FCC regulations.
      (7)   If any rate and/or charge are in excess of the FCC's standards, the
City may order that such rate and/or charge be reduced and the City may order a
refund of the amounts collected in excess of the permitted rate pursuant to
applicable FCC regulations.
      (8)   After the City determines the initial rate, or current rate at the
time of the City's certification, is appropriate pursuant to FCC regulations,
the Provider shall, in conjunction with each change in the rate and charges
applicable to basic cable service, conform to the standards of the FCC. Before
any rate change is effective, the Provider shall notify the City of its
proposed rate change pursuant to FCC regulations.
      (9)   To the extent specifically permitted by federal law and applicable
FCC rules, the Provider may appeal to the FCC for a review of the decision of
the City.
   (c)   Reimbursement of Costs. 
      (1)   The City may utilize a rate consultant to advise it on proposed
rate changes and to assist it in the procedures and the standards for review
adopted by the FCC. A rate consultant may be any person who has sufficient
background and experience, in the sole opinion of the City, to properly
evaluate and analyze rates and charges.
      (2)   All costs for the review of initial rates or rate changes shall be
paid by the Provider upon demand of the City, unless contrary to applicable
rules of the FCC governing these procedures or unless otherwise specifically
preempted by State or Federal law. The costs shall include, but not be limited
to, rate consultants, attorney's fees and the reasonable value of services (as
determined by the City) rendered by the City or any City employees, agents, or
representatives of the City.

or any ordinance of this City regulating the use and maintenance of private
swimming pools. The holder of any license which has been revoked may appeal
such revocation to Council by filing, in writing, with the Clerk of Council, a
request for a hearing thereon, which shall be heard at the next regular Council

   731.01 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   "Taximeter" means a mechanical instrument or device by which the
charge for hire of a taxicab is mechanically calculated, either for distance
traveled or for waiting time or both, and upon which such charges shall be
indicated by means of figures.
   (b)   "Taxicab" means any motor-driven vehicle engaged in the business of
carrying passengers for hire or fare, or offered for hire or fare to the public

(Ord. 744-46. Passed 3-21-46.)
731.02 JURISDICTION; ENFORCEMENT.
   The licensing and inspection of taxicabs, the inspecting and sealing of
taximeters, the examining of applicants for licenses to drive such taxicabs,
the licensing of drivers and the enforcing of the provisions of this Chapter
shall be under the direction of the City Manager, or his designated
representative hereafter, "City Manager".
(Ord. 744-46, massed 3-21-46.)
   731.03 NUMBER OF TAXICABS TO BE LICENSED.
   It is determined that the number of licenses to be issued for the operation
of taxicabs to sufficiently and adequately serve the need of the public for
such service within the City is eleven (11) as of June 1, 1964, and until the
further order of Council.
(Ord. 2793-64. Passed 6-1-64.)
731.04 DETERMINING PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY.
   No license for the operation of taxicabs in excess of the limitation
prescribed by Section
731.03 shall be issued unless and until Council shall by resolution declare
that public convenience and necessity require the issuance of additional
taxicab licenses in the number set forth in such resolution. Upon the passage
of such resolution, the City Manager shall be authorized to issue the specified
additional number of taxicab licenses.
   Before the adoption of such resolution, Council shall provide for such
public hearings, notice of the date of which shall be given to all existing
licensees, as may be necessary to determine whether public convenience and
necessity require the issuance of such licenses and the number of public
vehicles in respect to which licenses should be issued. In determining whether
public convenience and necessity require the issuance of any such licenses,
Council shall take consideration:
   (a)   The number of public vehicles then licensed;
   (b)   Whether the requirements of public convenience and necessity can be
met and complied with only by the issuance of such license or of any additional
license;
   (c)   The resulting effect upon the business of existing licenses and upon
the existing agencies of mass transportation;
   (d)   The effect on traffic congestion and safety of the public using the
streets;
   (e)   The effect upon working conditions and wages or other compensation
paid to drivers of public vehicles of existing licensees;
   (f)   The financial responsibility of the applicant;
   (g)   The character of the applicant;
   (h)   Any other factors which Council may deem relevant.
   In the event Council shall determine that public convenience and necessity
require the issuance of any additional license, holders of existing licenses
shall be given the opportunity to furnish any additional service in respect to
which the claim is asserted that the licensing of additional public vehicles is
required, and Council shall not authorize the issuance of any additional
license unless existing licensees shall, within a time stipulated in the
resolution, fail to provide the required additional service.
(Ord. 2077-59. Passed 6-1-59.)
731.05 EXCEPTION TO FINDING OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY.
   No finding of public convenience and necessity shall be required for the
issuance of licenses within the limitation of Section
731.03. The holders of licenses granted within the foregoing limitation shall
be entitled, without such finding of convenience and necessity, to retain and
to secure renewals thereof upon the payment of the annual license fee, provided
that the same have not been revoked or suspended for the failure to comply with
any other requirement of this Chapter or other regulation of the City.
(Ord. 2077-59. Passed 6-1-59.)
   731.06 VEHICLE LICENSE REQUIRED; APPLICATION.
   No taxicab shall operate for hire upon the streets of the City without

license is desired, the length of time the vehicle has been in use, the number
of persons it is capable of carrying, the motor power thereof and such other
information as the City Manager may deem necessary, together with a policy or

(Ord. 744-46. Passed 3-21-46.)
731.07 VEHICLE INSPECTION.
   When licenses or renewals of existing licenses are issued for taxicabs which
may have been disabled, disqualified, sold, or may otherwise not be available
at the time of the granting of the licenses, no such vehicle which may
thereafter be acquired for use in connection with any such licenses shall be
placed in operation until it has been thoroughly and carefully inspected and
examined and found to be in a thoroughly safe condition for the transportation
of passengers. It shall be clean, fit, of good appearance and well painted and
waxed. The City Manager shall thereafter make, or cause to be made, inspections
of such vehicle at intervals of not more than ninety (90) days during the
operation of such vehicle.
   The City Manager shall refuse to permit the operation of any such vehicle
or, if already placed in operation, revoke or suspend the operation of any
vehicle found by him to be unfit or unsuited for public patronage. He shall
examine any taximeter attached to any taxicab which may be placed in operation.
   The City Manager is authorized and empowered to establish reasonable rules
and regulations for the inspection of taxicabs and their appurtenances,
construction and condition or fitness.
(Ord. 744-46. Passed 3-21-46.)

taxicab for which a license is sought, acceptable to and approved by the City
Manager and the Director of Law, indemnifying the applicant in the sum of at
least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for injury to one person, one hundred
thousand dollars ($100,000) for injury to more than one person, and twenty-five
thousand dollars ($25,000) property damage in any one accident through the
operation of the taxicab of the applicant. The policy shall further contain a
clause obligating the surety company to give ten (10) days' written notice to
the City Manager before cancellation of the policy; the license shall expire
upon the lapse or termination of the policy of insurance.
   Such policy of insurance shall contain a provision for a continuing
liability thereunder to the full amount thereof, notwithstanding any recovery
thereon. If at any time in the judgment of the City Manager such policy is not
sufficient for any cause, the City Manager may require the owner of such
taxicab to replace such policy with another approved by the City Manager and
the Director of Law.
(Ord. 5641-86. Passed 5-19-86)
731.09 LICENSE CARD; ISSUANCE; DISPLAY.

   The card shall contain the official license number of the taxicab, together
with the date of inspection of same and a statement to the effect that, in case
of any complaints, the City Manager shall be notified, giving the license
number of the taxicab. Such card shall be signed by the City Manager, and shall
contain blank spaces upon which an entry shall be made of the date of every
inspection of the vehicle by the inspector. The license card shall be of a
distinctly different color each year and, in case of taxicabs driven by
mechanical power, the license number assigned thereunder shall in each case be
the same as that assigned to the vehicle number of such vehicle, which shall be
conspicuously displayed within the taxicab as prescribed by the City Manager.
(Ord. 744-46. Passed 3-21-46.)
731.10 LICENSE FEES.
   The following license fees shall be paid for each taxicab, fifty dollars
($50.00) per year (April 1 to March 31 of the following year). In case of
licenses issued on or after October 1 of each year, only one-half (½) of the
above fees shall be paid.
(Ord. 5641-86. Passed 5-19-86.)
731.11 TRANSFER OF LICENSE.
   In case a taxicab licensed under the provisions of this Chapter is sold or
otherwise removed from service as a taxicab in this City during the calendar
year for which a license has been issued for its use, the City Manager may,
upon application of the owner, permit the transfer of such taxicab license to a
motor vehicle replacing the one so sold or removed from service without any
additional fee being paid for such transfer. However, this provision shall not
apply to any taxicab license which has been revoked for cause during such
calendar year.
(Ord. 813-47. Passed 3-6-47.)
731.12 PERIODIC INSPECTION.
   The City Manager shall maintain constant vigilance over all taxicabs to see
that they are kept in a condition of continued fitness for public use. To this
end, the City Manager, through his inspectors, shall inspect all taxicabs from
time to time, as hereinbefore provided for, or on the complaint of any citizen,
as often as may be necessary. Reports in writing of all inspections shall
promptly be made to the City Manager.
(Ord. 744-46. Passed 3-21-46.)
731.13 SUSPENSION; REVOCATION.
   The City Manager shall, upon his own initiative and upon recommendation of
the Chief of Police, revoke or suspend any license granted under this Chapter
if the vehicle is used for immoral or illegal purposes or if the vehicle is not

reason that the vehicle has been used for immoral or illegal business or
purpose shall never be reissued, and licenses revoked because of the condition
and appearance of the vehicle shall not be reissued until the vehicle and its
appearance are put in fit condition for use by the public.

license or local operating license. If the State of Ohio determines that a new

Ohio Administrative Code, then the ownership change will not be permitted by
the City without a new local provisional license and a new local operating
license.

   (q)   Suspension of licenses.
      (1)   Suspension of licenses shall only be accomplished through the
procedures outlined in this subsection. Suspension shall be accomplished after

of such hearing, by certified mail and regular mail. The licensee shall have
the right to appear at such a hearing, to be represented by counsel, and to
examine and cross-examine witnesses.
      (2)   Suspension may take place without a prior hearing if the Local
Licensing Authority finds clear and convincing evidence that the continued
distribution of medical marijuana presents a danger of immediate and serious
harm to others. Notice of the suspension shall be made as provided in this
Section and a hearing on the merits of the suspension will take place within
five days of the suspension.
      (3)   The suspension will remain in effect, unless lifted by the Local
Licensing Authority, pending the results of the hearing. If the Local Licensing
Authority does not issue an order within ninety (90) days after the hearing,
the suspension shall be lifted on the ninety-first (91st) day following the
hearing.

of such hearing, by certified mail and regular mail. The licensee shall have
the right to appear at such a hearing, to be represented by counsel, and to
examine and cross-examine witnesses.
      (2)   If a medical marijuana dispensary's local provisional license or
local operating license is revoked, the medical marijuana dispensary will
coordinate with the City of Bedford and the Ohio Department of Commerce in the
closing of the facility as provided for in the Ohio Administrative Code.
 
   (s)   In the event of a decision or ruling adverse to a licensee or license
applicant regarding a denial, revocation, or suspension of a license, the
licensee or license applicant shall have the right to appeal such decision and
ruling to a court of competent jurisdiction, under authority of and pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. A notice of appeal in
such action shall be filed with the Office of the Mayor, as well as with the

   (c)   The permittee shall take appropriate measures to assure that during
the performance of the excavation work, traffic conditions as near normal as
possible are maintained at all times so as to minimize inconvenience to the
occupants of the adjoining property and to the general public.
   (d)   When traffic conditions permit, the Director may, by written approval,
permit the closing of streets and alleys to all traffic for a period of time
prescribed by him, if, in his opinion, it is necessary. The written approval of

   901.13 LOCATION OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL.
   (a)   All material excavated from trenches and piles adjacent to the trench
or in any street, shall be piled and maintained in such manner so as not to
endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets and
so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets
and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too
narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as
might be the case in a narrow alley, the Director shall have the authority to
require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a storage site and
then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling. It shall be the
permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission and make all
necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal sites.
   (b)   All trench and tunnel excavations and construction shall conform to
the safety requirements for shoring, bracing and ladders in trenches, in
accordance with State Trench and Tunnel Construction Safety Orders, as they now
or may hereafter exist.
   (c)   All material excavated shall be laid compactly along the side of the
trench and kept trimmed so as to cause as little inconvenience as reasonably
possible to vehicular and pedestrian traffic or as specified by the Director.
Whenever necessary, in order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate the
dirt nuisance, toe boards or bins may be required by the Director to prevent
the spreading of dirt into traffic lanes.
(Ord. 3428-69. Passed 8-18-69.)
901.14 CLEAN-UP OPERATIONS.

of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris resulting from such work.
All clean-up operations at the location of such excavation shall be
accomplished at the expense of the permittee and shall be completed to the
satisfaction of the Director. From time to time, as may be ordered by the
Director, and in any event immediately after completion of such work, the
permittee shall, at his own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and unused
materials of any kind resulting from such work and upon failure to do so within
twenty-four hours after having been notified to do so by the Director, the work
may be done by the Director and the cost thereof charged to the permittee. The
permittee shall also be liable for the cost thereof under the surety bond.
(Ord. 3428-69. Passed 8-18-69.)
901.15 PROTECTION OF WATERCOURSES.
   (a)   The permittee shall maintain all gutters free and unobstructed for the
full depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one foot in width from the
face of such curb at the gutter line. Whenever a gutter crosses an intersecting
street, an adequate waterway shall be provided and be at all times maintained.
   (b)   The permittee shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water,
muck, silt, slickings or other runoff pumped from excavations or resulting from
slicking or other operations and shall be responsible for any damage resulting
from his failure to so provide.

will be required by the Director to confine pavement damage to the limits of
the trench.
   (b)   Saw cutting of Portland cement concrete may be required by the
Director when the nature of the work or the condition of the street warrants.
When required, the depth of the cut shall not be less than one inch in depth.
However, depths greater than one inch may be required by the Director when the
circumstances warrant. Saw cutting may be required by the Director outside of
the limits of the excavation over caveouts, over breaks and small floating
sections.
   (c)   Heavy duty pavement breakers may be prohibited by the Director when
the use endangers existing substructures or other property.
   (d)   Sections of sidewalks shall be removed to the nearest score line or
joint.
   (e)   Unstable pavement shall be removed over cave-outs and over breaks and
the subgrade shall be treated as the main trench.
   (f)   Pavement edges shall be trimmed to a vertical face and neatly aligned
with the center line of the trench.
   (g)   Cutouts outside of the trench lines must be normal or parallel to the
trench line.
   (h)   Boring or other methods to prevent cutting of new pavement may be
required by the Director.
   (i)   The permittee shall not be required to repair pavement damage existing
prior to excavation unless his cut results in small floating sections that may
be unstable, in which case the permittee shall remove and pave the area.
(Ord. 3428-69. Passed 8-18-69.)
901.17 BACKFILLING.
   All backfilling shall be done with a clean cohesionless soil, such as sand
or gravel, free from lumps and stone or, if approved by the Director, other
material of equivalent compacting qualities. Broken pavement, large stones,
roots and other debris shall not be used in the backfill. Such backfill shall
be done in a manner that will permit the restoration of the surface to a
density condition not less than that existing prior to excavation, unless
otherwise specified. Backfill is required to be placed in lifts no greater than
three feet in depth if a Hydro Hammer or other heavy compactor is to be used.
Where hand compaction is to be done, the depth of the lift is limited to four
inches. In the latter case, the number of men backfilling shall not exceed the
number engaged in compacting. The Director may require soil tests to be
furnished by a recognized soil-testing laboratory or registered professional
engineer specializing in soil mechanics when, in his opinion, backfill for any
excavation is not being adequately compacted. In order for the resurfacing to
be permitted, such tests must show that the backfill material meets the minimum
requirements as prescribed by the Director. All expenses of such tests shall be
borne by the permittee.
(Ord. 3428-69. Passed 8-18-69.)
901.18 RESTORATION OF SURFACE.
   (a)   Permanent resurfacing of street excavations shall be made by the
permittee.
   (b)   The roadway surface cut shall be replaced in kind, according to the
current construction and material specifications of the State of Ohio
Department of Highways and those City specifications currently on file in the
office of the Director. However, the minimum specification for all flexible
pavement replacement shall be a three-inch lift of bituminous asphaltic
concrete laid over a minimum six inch granular base.
(Ord. 3428-69. Passed 8-18-69.)
901.19 LENGTH OF OPEN TRENCH.
   The maximum length of open trench permissible at any time shall be in
accordance with existing ordinances or regulations or as may be specified by
the Director. No greater length shall be open for pavement removal, excavation,
construction, backfilling, patching and all other operations without the
written permission of the Director.
(Ord. 3428-69. Passed 8-18-69.)
901.20 PROMPT COMPLETION OF WORK.
   After an excavation is commenced, the permittee shall prosecute with
diligence and expedition all excavation work covered by the excavation permit
and shall promptly complete such work and restore the street to its original
condition or as near as may be, so as not to obstruct the public place or
travel thereon more than is reasonably necessary.
(Ord. 3428-69. Passed 8-18-69.)
901.21 EMERGENCY COMPLETION.
   When traffic conditions, the safety or convenience of the traveling public
or the public interest require that the excavation work be performed as
emergency work, the Director shall have full power to order, at the time the
permit is granted, that a crew of men and adequate facilities be employed by
the permittee twenty-four hours (24 hrs.) a day, to the end that such
excavation work may be completed as soon as possible.
(Ord. 3428-69. Passed 8-18-69.)
901.22 EMERGENCY ACTION BEFORE PERMIT.
   Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the making of such
excavations as may be necessary for the preservation of life or property, for
the location of trouble in conduit or pipe or for making repairs, provided that
the person making such excavation shall apply to the Director for such a permit
on the first working day after such work is commenced.
(Ord. 3428-69. Passed 8-18-69.)
901.23 NOISE, DUST AND DEBRIS NUISANCES.
   Each permittee shall conduct and carry out excavation work in such manner as
to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and annoyance to the general public and
occupants of neighboring property. The permittee shall take appropriate
measures to reduce to the fullest extent practicable, in the performance of the
excavation work, noise, dust and unsightly debris. Between the hours of 9:00
p.m. and 7:00 a.m. he shall not use, except with the express written permission
of the Director or in case of an emergency, as herein otherwise provided, by
tool, appliance or equipment producing noise of sufficient volume to disturb
the sleep or repose of occupants of the neighboring property.

official or employee any liability or responsibility for damages to any person
injured by the performance of any excavation work for which an excavation
permit is issued hereunder; nor shall the City or any official or employee
thereof be deemed to have assumed any such liability or responsibility by

been installed shall be obtained according to the following rules:
   (a)   Where a sidewalk is to be constructed throughout the width of an
existing lot or sublot or other parcel of land regardless of the length of the
newly constructed walk, it shall be constructed as to its width to conform
exactly to the width of the existing walks at the termini thereof, provided the
widths of existing walks at each terminus of the newly constructed walk are the
same and are at least five feet wide at these terminal points.
   (b)   Where a sidewalk is to be constructed throughout the width of an
existing lot or sublot or other parcel of land and the existing sidewalks at
either terminus of such newly constructed walk are of different widths, the
newly constructed sidewalk shall be built to conform to the wider existing
walk, but in any event it shall be built not less than five feet in width and
shall taper gradually to any narrower walk at either terminus, beginning not
less than fifteen feet from such terminus and having the reduction of width on
the curb side.
   (c)   Where a sidewalk is to be constructed throughout the width of an
existing lot, sublot or other parcel of land and the walk is to be less than

existing lot, sublot or other parcel of land and the walk is to be less than
sixty feet in length and the existing sidewalks at each terminus of the newly
constructed walk are of different widths, the newly constructed sidewalk shall
be constructed in width to conform to the width of the wider of the two
existing sidewalks and shall taper gradually to the narrower walk at its
terminus, beginning not less than fifteen feet from such terminus and with the
reduction in width taking place entirely on the curb side of the newly
constructed sidewalks.
      (Ord. 5641-86. Passed 5-19-86.)
903.11 MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS.
   All sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete and shall meet the following
minimum specifications:
   (a)   Cement. The cement used in concrete shall be Portland cement of well
known brand and shall be subject to test by the Director in accordance with
Standard Methods of Sampling and Testing (Designation C 77-37) of the American
Society for Testing Materials.
   (b)   Grading. Excavation of subgrade shall include removal of all earth,
loam, shale, rock, roots, briars and undergrowth. All spongy material shall be
removed. Fills are to be made with cinders or other material acceptable to the
Director.
   (c)   Forms. Concrete shall be thoroughly mixed before being deposited in
clean steel or wooden forms adequately braced to prevent distortion from the
specified dimensions. All forms shall be of a size sufficient to produce a walk
of a minimum thickness or depth of four inches, except at driveways where the
thickness shall be six inches.
   (d)   Placing Concrete. 
      (1)   The concrete shall be thoroughly tamped and consolidated so that
none of the stone appears on the surface. The forms must be kept clean and
shall be coated with a suitable oil before filling with concrete.
      (2)   Foundation beds shall be sprinkled immediately prior to depositing
the concrete.
      (3)   Concrete when mixed shall be rapidly deposited in the forms and any
concrete not in final position within thirty minutes after completion of the
mixing shall be discarded. Under no circumstances shall concrete be used that
has partially set and the remixing of such materials is prohibited. The
concrete shall be deposited between bulkheads of a uniform thickness and to the
full depth and width of the walk; irregular or sloping surfaces shall be
avoided. The concrete, after being placed, shall be thoroughly compacted and
brought to the proper pitch and grade with a templet or straight edge.
      (4)   Immediately prior to the finishing of the surface, the walk shall
be cut into slabs not longer than six feet on any one side. The joints shall be
formed by a cutting tool or other means satisfactory to the Engineer. The
markings in the surface of the walk at these joints shall not be less than one-
fourth the thickness of the slab deep. All edges shall be rounded with an
approved edging tool to a radius of one-fourth of an inch.
   (e)   Surface Finish. The finishing of the walk shall immediately follow the
placing and compacting of the concrete. Unless otherwise ordered by the
Director, a finish produced by rubbing with wood floats will be required. The
surface shall be free from depressions or inequalities. The application of dry
cement to hasten drying of the surface is prohibited.
   (f)   Curing and Protecting. In rainy weather, the concrete shall be
protected as soon as it is finished. In hot or dry weather, the contractor
shall keep the concrete wet. Sprinkling shall be begun as soon as the concrete
is set sufficiently to prevent pitting and shall be continued at such intervals
as weather conditions may require or the Engineer may direct. All exposed
surfaces shall be sealed with a curing membrane applied at a minimum rate of
one gallon for each one hundred fifty square feet of surface treated. All
concrete shall be protected from freezing.
   (g)   Expansion Joints. Prepared strips of bitumen and fiber or mineral
aggregate shall be placed in concrete walks at intervals of at least twenty
feet, also at ends where the walk abuts curbing or other lateral walks and
along the building line where the walk is laid full width from the curb to the
building or other structures. Similar joints shall be placed around water meter
covers, gas boxes, hydrants, lamp standards or other fixed objects projecting
through the walk. All strips shall be one-fourth of an inch in thickness,
except for transverse joints when the temperature is below seventy degrees
Fahrenheit, in which event the strips shall be one-half of an inch in
thickness. The top of the strip shall be cut off flush with the top of the
concrete.
      (Ord. 5641-86. Passed 5-19-86.)
903.12 CLEANING AND REPAIR OF SIDEWALKS.
   No property owner shall fail to clean and keep in good repair the sidewalks
abutting his property. The Director may, by written notice order the repair of
any sidewalks. In the event that the property owner fails to repair such
sidewalks, within thirty days after receipt of such notice, the Director may
cause such sidewalks to be repaired, and the costs thereof shall be billed to
the property owner. Upon failure of the property owner to pay such bill within
thirty days after billing, Council, by ordinance, shall cause the costs to be
certified to the County Auditor, who shall place such costs upon the tax
duplicate to be collected together with penalties allowed by law as other taxes
are collected, and to be credited to the City.
(Ord. 2919-65. Passed 7-6-65.)
903.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any of the provisions of this Chapter is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree and shall be fined in an amount not exceeding
two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) or imprisoned for a period not
exceeding thirty days. Each day a violation continues or is permitted to
continue shall constitute a separate offense.

(Ord. 5641-86. Passed 5-19-86.)
905.21 TREE CUTTING.
   (a)   Intent.
      (1)   It is the intent of the Council of the City of Bedford to preserve
the City's woodland areas, stabilize sloped grades, reduce surface runoff,
erosion and downstream flooding, retain areas of rainfall percolation into the
water table, ameliorate climatic and weather extremes, support wildlife and
preserve the vegetational aesthetics.
      (2)   To this end this Council proposes, when development requires the
removal or reduction of trees and vegetation, to reduce the number of
potentially hazardous or otherwise undesirable trees and vegetation, and to
select more beneficial trees and vegetation as opposed to less beneficial, and
to promote a mixture of ages and species of vegetation where it naturally may
occur.
      (3)   It is not the intent of this Council to restrict or hinder
acceptable development within the City, but only to establish guidelines for
development compatible with long-term preservation of the woodland areas.
   (b)   Scope. In general, a permit for tree cutting shall be required for any
cutting of trees within the City except for the purposes and exceptions listed
in subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Permit Required.  
      (1)   Whenever a property owner contemplates cutting of a tree or trees
for the purpose of construction of subdivision improvements, construction of
new structures, alteration of existing structures, construction of additions to
existing structures, gaining access to property, conducting any earth activity,
obtaining a view, thinning of existing trees or vegetation, creating a pasture,
or in preparation for recreation or other use, the property owner must obtain a
permit from the City Building Commissioner.
      (2)   A property owner applying for a lot split or a subdivision where
tree cutting is a logical consequence of the application must also comply with
the requirements of this Chapter.
      (3)   Alternatively, a property owner may obtain a permit to cut a tree
or trees for up to ten (10) years in accordance with a master plan. Such master
plan shall be reviewed and approved by the owner and by an experienced arborist
in concert with the owner. Such master plan shall provide for long-term
woodland management and all cutting trees or vegetation shall be in strict
accordance with the permit requiring adherence to the master plan. The plan
shall be binding upon the owner(s) and his or her successors and assigns.
   (d)   Exceptions. In addition to any exceptions created in other sections of
this Code, no tree cutting permit shall be required for removal of trees under
the following conditions:
      (1)   Trees not less than 9" in caliper (diameter) (measured 54" above
the ground) may be cut without a permit; however, where multiple trees of less
than 9" in caliper (diameter) are to be cut for the purpose of creating a view,
a plan and permit are required.
      (2)   Property owners may not cut more than two (2) trees per year larger
than 9" in caliper (diameter) without a permit.
      (3)   Meadow maintenance under a long-term permit already issued may be
done without a new permit.
      (4)   Dead and diseased trees, and damaged trees which threaten life or
property, or which cannot be revived (e.g., blown off vertical), may be removed
without a permit; however, a tree-cutting contractor for such work must be
licensed.
   (e)   Acceptable Tree Removal Areas. The City Building Commissioner may
grant a tree removal permit only in the following areas:
      (1)   Within the area to be occupied by a permanent structure together
with 15 feet on all sides, subject to the City approval of the location of the
structure.
      (2)   Within an area occupied by access roads, parking areas, accessory
buildings, sidewalks, utility installation and similar necessary development
(subject to City approval of the location of said improvements).
   (f)   Prohibitions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of subsection (d)
hereof, logging of trees for economic gain is prohibited.
   (g)   Plan Required. The property owner, to obtain a permit, must submit a
plan consistent with the requirements of this Chapter that meets the approval
of the City. The Building Commissioner will apply the principles of maintaining
the woodland and/or meadow nature of the City of Bedford cited in this
section’s intent in deciding whether the plan is satisfactory or must be
altered in order to obtain a permit.
   (h)   Requirements of Plan. The plan filed with the City pursuant to
subsection (g) hereof shall include:
      (1)   The location of all trees 9" or larger in caliper (diameter)
(measured 54" above ground), within the area to be modified from its natural
state and 25' beyond in each direction, or to the property line, whichever is
less;
      (2)   An indication of which trees remain and which will be removed.
Trees to be removed will be marked on site with red ribbon;
      (3)   A general description of all other types of vegetation in the same
area;
      (4)   Existing and proposed topography;
      (5)   The nature and location of all improvements;
      (6)   The name and address of contractor.
   (i)   Tree Survey; Site Inspection. Within two weeks of submittal of the
plan, the Building Commissioner will approve, approve with modifications, or
disapprove the plan; if approved, the Building Commissioner shall issue a
permit authorizing selective cutting of timber but only after the City
representative and the owner or his representative shall together inspect the
area to be selectively cut, to red ribbon the specific trees to be cut. Only
trees so ribboned shall be cut. Each unauthorized cutting of an unmarked tree
shall constitute a separate violation of this section and shall constitute
grounds for the immediate revocation of the permit.
   (j)   Tree Protection; Damage. The owner or his representative shall take
all reasonable actions necessary to protect all remaining trees on the property
during construction. To obtain a permit, a plan to protect other trees on the
construction site must be submitted and approved.
   (k)   Licensing. All contractors for tree-cutting (other than the property
owner) must obtain a license from the City before tree-cutting begins. Tree-
cutting by a licensed contractor must be in compliance with an approved tree-
cutting permit, or fall within the exceptions in subsection (d) hereof. The
license fee is $5.00 and is good for one year.
   (l)   Schedule of Fees; Deposit. At the time of the filing of an application
for a tree cutting permit, the owner or his authorized representative shall
file the following fee:
      (1)   A non-refundable fee of five dollars ($5.00) for each tree over 9"
caliper to be removed.
      (2)   A deposit of one hundred dollars ($100.00) or such larger or lesser
amount as may be determined by the Building Commissioner based on his estimate
of cost to be incurred by the City and the City Arborist in reviewing the
application for a permit and to insure the payment by the applicant of expenses
incurred by the City in processing the application and pertinent papers
connected therewith. The cost and expense of any investigation which may be
necessary by the Building Commissioner, City Arborist or such other
professionals and such other City officials to determine whether the proposed
application is in accordance with the law, the cost of any and all notices
required and all other necessary expenses shall be paid by the owner. The
actual expenses shall be paid by the owner upon demand of the Finance Director.
The unexpended balance of the deposit shall be refunded to the applicant upon
completion of all administrative proceedings involved in connection therewith.
No filing fee shall be refunded or returned; no permits shall be issued until
any amounts required to be paid by the applicant have been paid.
      (3)   Alternatively, in lieu of all other fees or deposits, a non-
refundable fee of five dollars ($5.00) shall be required for a master plan
permit issued pursuant to subsection (c)(3) hereof.
      (4)   The fee required by subsection (l)(1) of this section may be
waived, at the discretion of the Building Commissioner, in those circumstances
when the Building Commissioner believes that the tree cutting is part of a
long-term meadow management or tree management plan consistent with the intent
of this Chapter.
   (m)   Appeal. Any person aggrieved by any of the provisions of this section,
final determination of the Building Commissioner or City Arborist may appeal to
the Planning Commission. Such appeal shall be taken within 20 days after the
date of the decision by filing with the Building Commissioner and City Clerk a
Notice of Appeal specifying the grounds therefore. The Building Commissioner
shall forthwith transmit to the Planning Commission all papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed was taken. The Planning Commission may
reverse or modify the decision appealed only on the grounds of hardship shown
by the appellant and that such a decision will not adversely affect the health,
safety, welfare and comfort of the City of Bedford or its citizens.
   (n)   Residential Lot Exception. This section shall not apply to residential
lots which are improved with a home (one and two family) and are fully
developed.
   (o)   Penalty. Any person convicted of violating any provision of this
section shall be found to be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree for
each offense. Each day on which a violation of this section is found to have
existed shall be deemed a separate offense.
(Ord. 6756-95. Passed 12-4-95.)
905.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this chapter for which no other penalty is
provided shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or
imprisoned not more than six months, or both, for each offense.

shall be in addition to any rate adjustments made by the City of Cleveland,
Division of Water.
   (c)   No later than December 15th of every year, the Director of Finance
shall determine the applicable water rates in accordance with the provisions of
this section. After the rate is determined and approved by Council, it shall
become effective January 1st of the subsequent year.
   (d)   The new water rate as determined by the Director of Finance shall be
kept on file with the Clerk of Council for public inspection.
   (e)   The minimum monthly water service charge (“base rate”) shall be paid
by each and every customer supplied with water by the City of Bedford.
   Commencing on January 1, 2024 and continuing through December 31, 2024, City
Council is hereby waiving the annual three percent (3%) increase in water rates
and is confirming the base rate for customer having meters of the following

industries shall as a minimum meet the national pretreatment standards or best
practical control technology currently available for incompatible pollutants as
published in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 128 or its
latest revision unless the City is committed, by its NPDES permit, or
constructural commitments to remove a specified percentage of the incompatible
pollutant. In those instances the applicable pretreatment standards may be
correspondingly reduced to levels determined by the Engineer, or his duly
authorized representative or State regulatory agencies.
   If the Engineer requires pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Engineer and State regulatory agencies and subject
to the requirements of all applicable codes, regulations, ordinances and laws.
(Ord. 5476-84. Passed 6-4-84.)
919.06 GREASE AND OIL INTERCEPTORS.
   For grease, oil and inorganic material such as sand, grit, etc.,
interceptors shall be provided when in the opinion of the Engineer, they are

the Engineer or his representative ready access at all reasonable times to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection of sampling or in the
performance of any of their duties. The Engineer shall have the right to set up
on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
metering or monitoring operations. Where a user has security measures in force
which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards
so that upon suitable identification, the City's personnel will be permitted to
enter without delay for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities.
(Ord. 5476-84. Passed 6-4-84.)
921.05 PRETREATMENT.
   Users shall make waste water acceptable under the limitations established
herein before discharging to any sanitary sewerage system. Any facilities
required to pretreat waste water to a level acceptable to the City shall be
provided and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Engineer for review, and shall be acceptable to the Engineer before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the City acting
through the Engineer under the provisions of this
Title. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the Engineer.
(Ord. 5476-84. Passed 6-4-84.)
921.06 PROTECTION FROM ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE.

materials or other wastes regulated by this
Title. Such facilities shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this
protection shall be submitted to the Engineer for review, and shall be
acceptable to the Engineer before construction of the facility. The review of
such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to provide the protection
necessary to meet the requirements of this section.
(Ord. 5476-84. Passed 6-4-84.)
921.07 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   All information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits, samplings, meterings, monitoring programs and
from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency
without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods which would be
detrimental to the user's competitive position. When requested by the user
furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade
secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the
public but shall be made available to other governmental agencies for
regulatory use pertaining to permits and grants. Waste water constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. Information
accepted by the City as confidential, shall not be transmitted to any
governmental agency or to the general public by the City for non-regulatory use
until and unless prior consent is given by the user.
(Ord. 5476-84. Passed 6-4-84.)

Engineer.
   (a)   If the user discharging industrial wastes into a sanitary sewerage
system procures any part, or all, of this water from sources other than the
City's water supply system, all or part of which is discharged into the
sanitary sewerage system, the user shall install and maintain at his expense
flow meters of a type approved by the Engineer for the purpose of determining
the volume of water obtained from those other sources.
   (b)   The user discharging industrial wastes into a sanitary sewerage system
may install and maintain at the user's expense metering devices for determining
the volume of waste being discharged to the public sewer, from which the
industrial waste surcharge would be computed. The measuring devices shall be of
a type acceptable to the Engineer.
   (c)   The Engineer may require the installation of devices for measuring the
volume of waste discharged if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from
the metered water consumption records.
   (d)   Any metering device for determining the volume of waste discharged to
the sanitary sewerage system shall be installed owned and maintained by the
user. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed
without the consent of the Engineer.
   (e)   Users without source meters. For users where, in the opinion of the
Engineer, it is unnecessary or impractical to install meters, the quantity of
waste may be based upon a rational determination of the waste water discharged
and may consider such factors as the number of fixtures, seating capacity,
population equivalent, annual production of goods and services or such other
determinants of water use necessary to estimate the waste water volume
discharged if such method is not in conflict with appropriate State or Federal
permit or grant conditions.
      (Ord. 5476-84. Passed 6-4-84.)
923.05 SAMPLING AND MONITORING.
   Industrial wastes discharged into the sanitary sewerage system shall be
subject to periodic inspection with a determination of character and
concentration of said wastes. The determination shall be made as often as may
be deemed necessary by the Engineer but in no case less than two twenty-four
hour composite samples per month. The user shall be responsible for the
collection.
   (a)   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of
the composition of the wastes. The sampling shall be accomplished by the use of
automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting composite samples in
proportion to flow.
   (b)   Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the Engineer or his
authorized representative at all times. Every care shall be exercised in the
collection of samples to insure their preservation in a state comparable to
that at the time the sample was taken.
      (Ord. 5476-84. Passed 6-4-84.)
923.06 ANALYSES.
   Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial wastes may be
used subject to mutual agreement between the Engineer and the user.
   (a)   Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial
wastes shall be made by the user responsible for the discharge, or his
qualified agent as approved by the Engineer. The results of the analyses, shall
be reported to the Engineer on a monthly basis on forms provided by the
Engineer. The Engineer shall make his own analyses on the wastes and these
determinations shall be binding as a basis for charges, except under
circumstances to the following paragraph.
   (b)   In case the analyses performed by the user and the Engineer result in
substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the industry to
collect samples at the same time the Engineer collects his own samples. The
results of the analyses on the samples collected by the Engineer and the user
shall be compared using the same testing procedures as outlined in the latest
edition of "Standard Methods". If a substantial difference in values still
exists, another set of samples shall be collected and analyzed at a State or
state approved laboratory selected by the Engineer.
      (Ord. 5476-84. Passed 6-4-84.)
923.07 TESTING STANDARDS AND METHODS.
   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes to which reference is made in this
Title shall be determined in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136 and the latest
edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater,"
published by the American Public Health Association, and shall be determined at
the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control
manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer
to the point which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried
on by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon
the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and
property.

CROSS REFERENCES
         Federal Act - see S.U. & P.S.
917.02(m)
   925.01 CLASSIFICATION OF USERS.
   (a)   All users shall be classified by assigning each one to a "user
classification" category according to the principal activity conducted on the
user's premises and based on the typical waste water constituents and
characteristics for that type of user as determined by the Engineer. The
purpose of such classification is to facilitate the regulation of waste water
constituents and characteristics, to provide an effective means of source
control, and to establish a system of user charges and fees which will insure
an equitable recovery of the sanitary sewerage system's construction, operation
and maintenance costs. Waste water constituents and characteristics may include
but not be limited to the following: Suspended Solids, BOD, COD, Oil and
Grease, and Chlorine Demand.
   (b)   User classifications are as follows:
      (1)   Vehicle Service: gas stations, auto dealerships, bus companies,
undercoating shops;
      (2)   Food Processing: grocery stores, caterers, provision businesses,
restaurants, convenient marts;
      (3)   Institutions: hospitals, schools, churches, social halls, clinics;
      (4)   Light Industrial: machine shops, electroplates;
      (5)   Heavy Industrial;
      (6)   Service and Retail Businesses.
         (Ord. 5641-86. Passed 5-19-86.)
925.02 TYPES OF CHARGES AND FEES.
   A user classification charge may be adopted for each user category based
upon the charges for the average waste water constituents and characteristics
for each user classification. The charges for each waste water constituent and
characteristic shall be established by the City and set forth in the City's
schedule of charges and fees included herein or adopted by the City. The City
may adopt a schedule of charges and fees which may include:
   (a)   User classification charges;
   (b)   Fees for permit applications;
   (c)   Appeal fees;
   (d)   Charges and fees based on waste water constituents and characteristics
to include industrial cost recovery provisions of the Federal Act.
      (Ord. 5476-84. Passed 6-4-84.)
925.03 DETERMINATION OF USER CHARGES.
   (a)   Users without Waste Water Discharge Permits. Each user, not required
to obtain a Waste Water Discharge Permit, shall pay the applicable user charge
as established by the City and set forth in the City's schedule of user charges
and fees. This charge shall be determined by multiplying the user
classification charge by the determined waste water volume. The City may elect
to set a fixed unit charge as set forth in the City's schedule of user charges
and fees for certain user classifications based on waste water constituents and
characteristics. For the purpose of determining waste water user charges the
minimum Standard Classification charge shall be based upon a maximum strength
of domestic waste water such as:
 
BOD              200 mg/l
COD              500 mg/l
Suspended Solids 220 mg/l
Oil and Grease   50 mg/l
 
   (b)   Users with Waste Water Discharge Permits. Users who are issued a Waste
Water Discharge Permit under the provisions of this
Title shall pay a user charge determined by multiplying the charge for each
waste water constituent and characteristic by volume of water discharged.
   (c)   All persons discharging industrial waste water into the public sewers
as determined under the provisions of this
Title shall be subject to surcharges determined monthly solely on the basis of
the following formula:
 
P = (A) x BOD5 + (B) x SS
 
P       =    monthly surcharge.
BOD5       =   pounds of biochemical oxygen demand per month in excess of maximum
allowable concentration in the waste water (per Section
925.03(a)).
SS       =    pounds of suspended solids per month in excess of maximum allowable
concentration in the waste water (per Section
925.03(a)).
A and B    =    refers to the total expenditures per pound of BOD5 ($0.14 per
pound) and suspended solids ($0.14) per pound), respectively, to collect, convey
and treat the waste water as determined by the City acting through the Engineer.

Title and together with such other waste water information and notices which
may be furnished by the City or its Engineer from time to time directed toward
more effective water pollution control. A notice shall be furnished and
permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board advising employees whom to call
in case of an accidental discharge in violation of this
Title.
   (c)   Preventive Measures. Any direct or indirect connection or entry point
for persistent or deleterious wastes to the user's plumbing or drainage system
should be eliminated. Where such action is impractical or unreasonable the user
shall appropriately label such entry points to warn against discharge of such
wastes in violation of this
Title.

modifications as it deems necessary, a detailed time schedule of specific
actions which the user shall take in order to prevent or correct a violation of
requirements.
(Ord. 5476-84. Passed 6-4-84.)
927.04 APPEALS.
   Any user, permit applicant, or permit holder affected by any decision,
action, or determination, including cease and desist orders, made by the City,
its Engineer, County Prosecutor or Courts, interpreting or implementing the
provisions of this
Title or in any permit issued herein, may file with the appropriate entity a
written request for reconsideration within ten days or the appropriate legal
period, of such decision, action, or determination, setting forth in detail the
facts supporting the user's request for reconsideration.
   If the ruling is one made by the Engineer and is unsatisfactory to the user
requesting reconsideration, he may within ten days after notification of the
Engineer's action, file a written appeal to the City Council. The written
appeal shall be attempted to be considered by Council within thirty days for

(Ord. 9755-20. Passed 2-18-20.)
   (b)   No building permits shall be issued by the Department of Building for
the construction of buildings within the City unless there are deposited with
the Building Commissioner such performance cash or surety bonds in the amounts
hereinafter set forth to insure to the City that all work shall be properly
completed and at the conclusion of the work, the refuse shall be properly
disposed of and any damage to sidewalks, curbing, public utilities or adjoining
property caused by such construction shall be properly repaired or replaced.
The value of said bond shall be equal to 100% of the total value of all work
being performed or all structures being constructed in the City of Bedford at
any one time. This bond shall be for the benefit of the City only, is not
assignable, and shall not create any third-party beneficiaries. This bond shall
be supplemental to that required in Section
1303.08. The term of such bond shall be the entire term of construction of the
project.
(Ord. 9106-13. Passed 9-3-13.)
   (c)   When each building or portion thereof for which a deposit has been
made under this section is completed, the owner or his agent shall notify the
Department of Building and request a final inspection of the work and refund of
the deposit. If the Building Commissioner finds that the work has been
completed satisfactorily, that no property has been damaged and that all refuse
has been properly disposed of, he shall issue an order to the Director of
Finance to return to the depositor the original deposit less the sum of ten
dollars ($10.00) which is to be retained by the City as a final inspection fee.
In the event that the Building Commissioner finds the work incomplete or that
property has been damaged or that the premises are left in an unclean
condition, he shall notify the owner or his agent and return of the deposit
shall be withheld until the matters complained of are corrected satisfactorily
and in the event the owner or his agent does not make the necessary corrections
within a reasonable time after notification by the Building Commissioner, the
Commissioner shall cause the same to be made and advise the Director of Finance
to deduct the cost thereof from the deposit made and to return the balance to
the depositor.
(Ord. 7215-00. Passed 3-6-00.)
1305.02 APPLICATION.
   An application for a permit, signed by the owner or his authorized agent,

dwelling or alteration amounting to twenty-five percent (25%) or more of
existing buildings shall be accompanied by two (2) sets of plans and
specifications. The plans shall include:
   (a)   Site plan, showing location on premises; minimum scale: fifty feet (50

work will conform to the provisions of this Building Code and all other
applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. Each set of plans and
specifications shall give the address of the work, name and address of the
owner and of the person who prepared them.
   (f)   The plans shall show the elevation and contour of the property as
existing before the improvement and after. The Building Commissioner shall set
the grade of the property and may require the assistance of engineering
services, to be furnished by the City, but paid for by the applicant. The
location and depth of the footers beneath the final grade shall be clearly
indicated on the plans.
      (Ord. 7215-00. Passed 3-6-00.)
1305.04 LANDSCAPING.
   (a)   The builders of all new structures in the City shall landscape the
front yard, rear yard, side yard and tree lawn of all new structures in order
to prevent the deterioration of property values in the neighborhood of such new
structures in the event such new structure remains unsold or unoccupied for a
period of time following completion. Such landscaping includes preparing a
lawn, by either seeding or sodding, and planting all necessary shrubbery, and
shall be accomplished within a period of sixty (60) days after completion of
the building, unless extended for good cause, such as weather conditions, or as
may be determined by the Building Commissioner.
   (b)   At the time of obtaining a building permit the builder shall include
in his performance bond an amount sufficient to guarantee such landscaping as
may be required by the Building Inspector considering the size of the lot and
the expected cost of such landscaping according to the plans filed by the
builder.
(Ord. 7215-00. Passed 3-6-00.)
1305.05 DESIGN DATA.
   Sufficient data to show the adequacy of the design shall be submitted when
required by the Building Inspector. The Building Commissioner may require and
accept an affidavit from a registered architect or registered professional
engineer, stating that the design conforms to the provisions of this Building
Code.
(Ord. 7215-00. Passed 3-6-00.)
1305.06 PLANS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES.
   (a)   All plans for the construction, alteration, repair or addition of any
building or structure, including one, two and three-family dwelling houses and
accessory structures, shall be submitted for review per the applicable sections
of the Ohio Basic Building Code and the Bedford Dwelling House Code. The
applicant shall pay the fee submitted by such Plans Examiner for inspection and
approval of such plans, or for any consultant deemed necessary by the Building
Commissioner.
   (b)   In order to assure the payment of fees as required in Section
1305.06(a), the Building Commissioner may require the applicant to deposit an
amount up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) with the City. The cost of the plan
review shall be deducted from this deposit and the balance refunded to the
applicant.
(Ord. 7215-00. Passed 3-6-00.)
1305.07 ISSUANCE OF PERMIT.
   (a)   Approval. If the Building Commissioner is satisfied that the work
described in an application for a permit and the plans and specifications filed
therewith conform to and comply with the requirements of this Building Code and
other pertinent laws and ordinances, upon payment of the required fee he shall
issue or authorize the issuance of a permit.
   (b)   Disapproval. If the application for a permit, and the plans and
specifications filed therewith, describe work which does not conform to the
requirements of this Building Code or other pertinent laws or ordinances, or
does not contain sufficient information, the Building Commissioner shall not
issue a permit but shall return the plans and specifications to the applicant
with his refusal to issue such permit. The Building Commissioner shall give in
writing such reasons for rejection as he deems sufficient.
(Ord. 7215-00. Passed 3-6-00.)
1305.08 COLLECTION OF CHARGES FOR PROPERTY NOT PREVIOUSLY ASSESSED.
   No building permit shall be issued in the City for the improvement of any
lot or land until the Building Commissioner responsible for issuing such
permits first investigates the City records to determine whether the property
to be improved abuts upon, or will make use of, any improvement in the City,
which was made by an assessment procedure. If he further determines that the
property to be improved has been assessed, the permit shall be issued upon all
other lawful requirements being met. If the property to be improved was not
assessed for the reason, the Building Commissioner shall advise the City
Manager who shall cause an investigation to determine the reason why the
property was not assessed and determine a tap-in charge to be placed against
the property to be improved equal to the assessment that would have been paid,
had the property been assessed, by using whatever factors were made, applied
and used against other similar abutting property owners in the improvement.
   The City Manager shall thereafter notify the applicant of his findings,
together with the proposed tap-in charge. No permit shall be issued until the
tap-in charge has been paid in full, in advance, to the City.
   The applicant, upon receipt of the abovementioned notice may either pay the
tap-in charge or file an appeal with Council. Council shall, within two regular
meetings, provide the applicant with a reasonable opportunity to be heard and
may affirm, modify or reverse the decision of the City Manager, by motion.
Council reserves the right to table such a request, pending the obtaining of
further information in the event Council desires to investigate the appeal
further.
   This section shall apply to all properties in the City, whether assessed in
the past or future.
(Ord. 7215-00. Passed 3-6-00.)
1305.09 BUILDING PLAN REVIEW BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   No permit shall be issued in any use district, for any structure other than
a one, two or three-family dwelling or accessory structure, until the building
plans have first been submitted to the Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission shall review, recommend and study the plans to determine whether the
plans are in conformity with all applicable State and municipal laws and to
determine whether the shape, appearance, size or design of the building will
have a substantial and adverse effect on property values or historical
significance in the area where the improvement is to be made. The Planning
Commission is authorized to use a licensed architect where necessary to be
selected by the City Manager, so that the Commission may approve, conditionally
approve or disapprove the building plans and any such order shall be in
writing. The applicant for the building plans may appeal any condition in a
conditional approval or disapproval to Council by making a written demand for a
hearing. He shall file such demand with the Clerk of Council or City Manager
but such notice of appeal must be made within ten (10) days after delivery of
the notice to the applicant or his authorized agent. Any such notice shall
advise the applicant that the notice of appeal must be made within ten (10)
days as hereinabove provided. Council may either approve, disapprove or modify
the decision of the Planning Commission or refer it back to the Commission or
any other Board or agency for further proceedings.
(Ord. 7215-00. Passed 3-6-00.)
1305.10 SITE PLAN APPROVAL; REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.

      (2)   Proposed circulations, including access streets, aisles and lanes,
parking spaces, loading areas, loading berths or docks, pedestrian walks and
all related facilities for the movement and storage of goods, vehicles and

of the City and shall comply with each and every code requirement applicable,
either of the City or State, unless specifically excepted by the proper
governmental agency.
      (2)   Adequate access and off-street parking and loading facilities shall
be provided for employees and visitors as required for each particular use.

1305.11 CONDITIONS OF PERMIT.
   A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work.
It shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside
any of the provisions of this Building Code or other applicable laws,
ordinances, rules or regulations, nor shall such issuance of a permit prevent
the Building Commissioner or Building Inspector from thereafter requiring a
correction of serious errors in plans or in construction, or of violations of
this Building Code or of other applicable laws, ordinances, rules or
regulations. The Building Commissioner or Building Inspector shall not incur
any personal liability or expense or impose any liability or expense upon the
City by virtue of his prior approval of any plan or specification later
determined by him or any other authority to be in contravention of this
Building Code or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules or regulations.
(Ord. 7215-00. Passed 3-6-00.)
1305.12 TIME LIMITATION.
   (a)   Any application for Planning Commission or Building Department
approval shall be considered null and void when there has been no re-submittal
or other activity for a ninety period. Any building permit shall become invalid
if the work authorized by it is not commenced within six months of the permit
issuance, or if the work is suspended or abandoned for a period of six months
during the term of construction, or if the work is not completed within a
period of one year of the permit issuance. One or more extensions of time may
be requested by showing reasonable cause, and granted by written permission of
the Building Inspector. Extensions may be granted for periods not exceeding one
year on the first extension and ninety days each on subsequent extensions.
   (b)   Work performed in conjunction with approved plans and specifications
and for which a building permit has been issued shall be diligently pursued and
completed in a timely manner. No exterior alterations or exterior portions of
new construction shall be left incomplete longer than the building season in
which it is begun. No project of any nature shall be undertaken if said project
is to continue longer than twelve calendar months from the date of issuance of
the permit unless such continuance is approved in writing by the Building
Commissioner prior to the start of construction. Should the term of any project
exceed the times as herein permitted, the Building Commissioner shall contact
the bonding company of the contractor responsible for the delay or take any
other action deemed necessary and instruct that entity to complete the work
immediately.
   (c)   No owner or contractor shall commence work on any project which
involves the exterior alteration of a property or premises unless the primary
contractor submits a performance bond in an amount equal to one hundred percent
(100%) of the value of the construction. New construction or new additions
shall be bonded at the rate of eighty dollars ($80.00) per square foot of new
or additional square footage of all space under roof, including basements and

1305.13 WORK WITHOUT PERMIT.
   Where work, for which a permit is required by this Building Code, is started

fully complying with the requirements of this Building Code or any other law of
the State of Ohio or ordinance of this City.

CERTIFICATE OF INSPECTION
 
1311.18 CERTIFICATE TO BE FURNISHED BY SELLER.
   (a)   No person shall sell or enter into an agreement to sell or convey by
land contract or otherwise, any interest in any dwelling, building or structure
as defined in the Zoning Code without furnishing the buyer, prior to such sale,
a current Certificate of Inspection setting forth the authorized use of the
dwelling, building or structure under the ordinances of the city and listing
any code violations; and, when code violations still remain outstanding at the
time of delivery of possession or transfer of title, an escrow shall be
established, and there shall be deposited in that escrow both a statement from
the buyer acknowledging receipt of the Certificate and an amount of money equal
to 100% of the value of the work required to bring into compliance with city
ordinances and codes all outstanding violations, performance bond, or an amount
authorized by the City Manager & the Building Commissioner. However, a
statement signed by both the seller and the buyer stating that the premises are
undeveloped and contain no dwelling, building or structure may be deposited in
escrow in lieu of documents and/or funds required herein.
   (b)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any real estate premises to
transfer legal or equitable ownership of that premises ("title") without having
obtained a pre-sale inspection of it under this code. This inspection will
enable the code official to work toward accomplishing the purposes of this code
by listing any repairs or other work necessary to eliminate any unsafe or
hazardous conditions, to comply with applicable requirements of the Building
Code, Fire Code, Zoning Code and other ordinances, and also to correct any
unlawful nuisance conditions in the form of violations of this Property
Maintenance Code. Such an inspection and list shall be part of the process of
issuing the required certificate of occupancy.
   (c)   Application for a pre-sale inspection shall be made on such form and
in such manner as may be prescribed from time to time by the code official. The
city may charge a fee for this service as provided for under Section
1311.22.
   (d)   Within 30 days after application was made for a pre-sale inspection,
the code official shall have completed the inspection, compiled a list of any
items to be brought into compliance with this code and applicable provisions of
the Building Code, Fire Code, Zoning Code and other ordinances, and shall have
issued a violation letter to the owner or lienholder of a premises. This period
of time may be extended by the code official if a delay is caused by any matter
beyond the reasonable control of that official.
   (e)   A certificate of inspection shall be valid for one year after the
violations have been corrected to the satisfaction of the code official or
until 60 days after the premises may be transferred to a new owner or tenant,
whichever occurs sooner.
   (f)   If the owner, occupant, or agent thereof does not consent to the
proposed inspection, the code official may appear before any judge in a court
of competent jurisdiction and seek an administrative search warrant to allow an
inspection. Any such application shall be made within ten (10) calendar days
after the nonconsent. The application for the warrant shall specify the basis
upon which the warrant is being sought and shall include a statement that the
inspection will be limited to a determination whether there are violations of
the code provisions identified in this section. The court may consider any of
the following factors along with such other matters as it deems pertinent in
its decision as to whether a warrant shall issue:
      (1)   Eyewitness account of violation;
      (2)   Citizen complaints;
      (3)   Tenant complaints;
      (4)   Plain view violations;
      (5)   Violations apparent from city records;
      (6)   Property deterioration;
      (7)   Age of property;
      (8)   Nature of alleged violation;
      (9)   Condition of similar properties in the area;
      (10)   Documented violations on similar properties in the area;
      (11)   Passage of time since last inspection;
      (12)   Previous violations on the property.
   (g)   If a warrant is issued, no owner, occupant, or agent thereof shall
fail or neglect, upon presentation of a warrant, to properly permit entry
therein by the code official or his/her duly authorized designee for the
purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this section and consistent
with the terms of the warrant. If the court declines to issue a warrant, or if
no warrant is sought, the inspection shall still take place but the scope
thereof shall be limited to such areas as are in plain view. A limited-scope
inspection conducted pursuant to this paragraph shall be considered an
"inspection" for purposes of Chapter
1311 and all other provisions of Title 3 pertaining to the pre-sale inspection
program set forth in this section. No criminal penalty shall attach, nor shall
any certificate of occupancy be denied, solely by reason of the owner's,
occupants, or agent's refusal to consent to a full inspection.
   (h)   A certificate of inspection signed by the code official shall be
evidence that the premises complies with the requirements of this code and all
other applicable ordinances, provided however, that if a limited-scope
inspection is conducted pursuant to subsection F above, the certificate of
occupancy shall note that fact and shall not constitute evidence of code
compliance as to any uninspected portions of the premises. If the inspection
disclosed aspects of the property not in compliance, the certificate shall be
merely a conditional certificate of inspection. The condition shall be that the
defective aspects of the premises must be brought into compliance with this
code within such reasonable length of time as may be set forth in the
certificate.
   (i)   Such a conditional certificate shall be deemed to be a notice under
Section
1311.18 that the premises and its owners are in violation of this code or other
applicable ordinances and that the unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful conditions
must be corrected. The certificate shall constitute a notice, as referred to in
Chapter
1311 and its subparts, and shall include all matters required by that section.
(Ord. 9411-16. Passed 8-1-16.)

NOTE: The City of Bedford is a historical district made up of dwellings and
other structures with a distinctive and unique architectural style. It is the
intent of Bedford City Council to preserve this architectural style and detail
of its existing housing stock. In the repair or alteration of a dwelling or
accessory structure, particularly for the purposes of satisfying the Point of
Sale requirements, existing architectural details, materials and styles shall
be preserved, repaired, matched or reproduced and not removed, altered,
destroyed or replaced with alternate materials.
   Such Certificate of Inspection shall not be valid beyond the last day of the
twelfth month following the date of issuance unless renewed prior thereto in
the same manner as required for issuance of the original Certificate.
   If corrections cannot be made by the seller prior to the transfer of the
title, an escrow account shall be established, into which an amount of money
shall be placed equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the value of the
uncompleted repairs or corrections. This amount shall be established by
procuring at least one estimate from a company capable of performing the work
and which is currently registered to work in the City of Bedford. These funds
shall be disbursed only after verification from the Building Official that the
work is complete. While all estimates must be reviewed by the Bedford Building
Department for completeness and adequacy prior to the transfer of title, the
Building Department assumes no responsibility that the amount of money held in
escrow will be sufficient to finance the necessary corrections. It shall also
be noted that the seller, their agents, or in specific cases when authorized by
the Building Official, the buyer, shall be held responsible for the abatement
of all violations regardless of the amount of money held in escrow. The
Building Official shall establish on the Certificate of Inspection a reasonable
time frame for the completion of the work. At the expiration date of the time
period set forth in the Certificate of Inspection, the Building Official or his
authorized representative shall inspect the work to determine compliance.
   When it is determined by the Division of Building that a dwelling, building
or structure is in compliance with the provisions of these Codified Ordinances
and all other applicable rules and regulations applicable thereto, the Building
Official shall issue a Certificate of Point of Sale Compliance for the
premises.

structure, used or designed or intended to be used as a single or a multi-

Certificates of Rental License issued by the Building Commissioner for such
unit(s) or structure, which certificate has not expired, been revoked or
otherwise become null and void, except licensed rooming houses.
   (b)   It shall be unlawful for the owner of any real estate premises to
change a tenant without having obtained an inspection of it under this code.
This inspection will enable the code official to work toward accomplishing the
purposes of this code by listing any repairs or other work necessary to
eliminate any unsafe or hazardous conditions, to comply with applicable
requirements of the Building Code, Fire Code, Zoning Code and other ordinances,
and also to correct any unlawful nuisance conditions in the form of violations
of this Property Maintenance Code. Such an inspection and list shall be part of
the process of issuing the required certificate of rental inspection.
   (c)   Notification for a Certificate of Rental Inspection shall be made on
such form and in such manner as may be prescribed from time to time by the code
official. The city may charge a fee for this service as provided for under
Section
1311.32.
   (d)   Within 30 days after Notification was received by the code official,
the code official shall have completed the inspection, compiled a list of any
items to be brought into compliance with this code and applicable provisions of
the Building Code, Fire Code, Zoning Code and other ordinances, and shall have
issued a violation letter to the owner or lienholder of a premises. This period
of time may be extended by the code official if a delay is caused by any matter
beyond the reasonable control of that official.
   (e)   A certificate of rental inspection shall be valid for two years after
the violations have been corrected to the satisfaction of the code official or
until 60 days after the premises may be transferred to a new owner or tenant,
whichever occurs sooner.
   (f)   If the owner, occupant, or agent thereof does not consent to the
proposed inspection, the code official may appear before any judge in a court
of competent jurisdiction and seek an administrative search warrant to allow an
inspection. Any such application shall be made within ten (10) calendar days
after the non-consent. The application for the warrant shall specify the basis
upon which the warrant is being sought and shall include a statement that the
inspection will be limited to a determination whether there are violations of
the code provisions identified in this section. The court may consider any of
the following factors along with such other matters as it deems pertinent in
its decision as to whether a warrant shall be issued:
      (1)   Eyewitness account of violation;
      (2)   Citizen complaints;
      (3)   Tenant complaints;
      (4)   Plain view violations;
      (5)   Violations apparent from city records;
      (6)   Property deterioration;
      (7)   Age of property;
      (8)   Nature of alleged violation;
      (9)   Condition of similar properties in the area;
      (10)   Documented violations on similar properties in the area;
      (11)   Passage of time since last inspection;
      (12) Previous violations on the property.

fail or neglect, upon presentation of a warrant, to properly permit entry
therein by the code official or his/her duly authorized designee for the
purpose of conducting a rental inspection and examination pursuant to this
section and consistent with the terms of the warrant. If the court declines to
issue a warrant, or if no warrant is sought, the rental inspection shall still
take place but the scope thereof shall be limited to such areas as are in plain
view. A limited-scope rental inspection conducted pursuant to this paragraph
shall be considered a an "rental inspection" for purposes of Chapter
1311 and all other provisions of the rental inspection program set forth in
this section.
      (1)   No criminal penalty, or any penalty or fine under Chapter
1311, shall attach, nor shall any certificate of rental inspection be denied,
solely by reason of the owner's, occupant's or agent's refusal to consent to a
full inspection.
   (h)   A certificate of rental inspection signed by the code official shall
be evidence that the premises complies with the requirements of this code and
all other applicable ordinances, provided however, that if a limited-scope
inspection is conducted pursuant to subsection (g) above, the certificate of
rental inspection shall note said fact and shall not constitute evidence of
code compliance as to any uninspected portions of the premises. If the
inspection disclosed aspects of the property not in compliance, the certificate
shall be merely a conditional certificate of rental inspection. The condition
shall be that the defective aspects of the premises must be brought into
compliance with this code within such reasonable length of time as may be set
forth in the certificate.
   (i)   Such a conditional certificate of rental inspection shall be deemed to
be a notice under Section
 1311.29 that the premises and its owners are in violation of this code or
other applicable ordinances and that the unsafe, hazardous, or unlawful
conditions must be corrected. The certificate shall constitute a notice, as
referred to in Chapter
1311 and its subparts, and shall include all matters required by that section.
(Ord. 9473-17. Passed 3-9-17.)
   (j)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Chapter, no certificate
shall be issued for any structure used or intended to be used for residential
occupancy located on a parcel which:
      (1)   has a certified delinquent property tax balance or other unpaid
liens that appear on the Cuyahoga County Real Property Tax duplicate unless the
property owner, agent, or person in charge of such structure provides
documentation of being on a Delinquent Payment Plan in good standing with the
Cuyahoga County Treasury; or
      (2)   has an unpaid balance for nuisance abatement costs imposed by the
City pursuant to Subsection
511.12 that has not been placed on the Cuyahoga County Real Property Tax
duplicate.
If such structure as described above is determined to be occupied by a tenant,
the Building Commissioner shall provide notice to such tenant of the rejection
of application for the issuance or renewal of a Certificate of Inspection.
Notice shall be by mail, hand delivery, or posting on the structure.
Notwithstanding the requirement of notice provided herein, failure of the
Building Commissioner to notify a tenant shall not preclude the enforcement of
any provision of this Chapter. (Ord. 9586-18. Passed 5-7-18.)

runoff.
(Ord. 5641-86. Passed 5-19-86.)
1323.10 PROTECTION AGAINST EROSION.
   All excavations and fills shall be performed so as to minimize soil erosion
and sedimentation.
   (a)   Backfilling. Backfilling and related work shall be so done and the
quality of the materials used shall be such as to prevent the movement of the
earth of adjoining properties or the subsequent caving-in of backfilled areas.
Backfilling shall not be done until retaining walls, foundation walls or other
construction against which backfill is placed are in suitable condition to
resist lateral pressure. No backfilling shall be done by methods which may
cause dislodgement of any retaining wall or other permanent structure.
   (b)   Nuisances to be Abated. No condition shall be created, or any existing
condition maintained, whereby there will be upon any lot or plot excavations,
depressions, pits, holes, gullies or similar depressions which may accumulate
and retain surface water and which may become a public hazard or nuisance. Any
such condition shall be promptly abated and protected by filling or by
providing positive drainage and, where necessary, by the erection of a
barricade, fence and warning lights.
   (c)   Grading or Filling. When a lot or plot is graded to a higher or lower
finished grade level than the established grade on an adjacent developed
property, the owner of such lot or plot shall provide a suitable retaining wall
or walls, or other approved protection, on his own property to protect the
adjacent property from caving of earth and as required to maintain the existing
established grade of such adjacent property.
   (d)   Action in the Event of Failure. In the event the person whose duty it
is, under the provisions of this Chapter, to make safe an excavation, to
prevent movement of adjoining earth or to maintain, support or protect
adjoining buildings or other structures shall neglect or fail to do so, the
Director of Public Service or the Building Inspector shall notify such person,
in writing, of his duties under the provisions of this Chapter. If such person
shall fail to perform the duty required by this Chapter within such reasonable
time after receipt of such notice as may be allowed by the Director of Public
Service or the Building Inspector, the Director of Public Service or the
Building Inspector may cause or order such work to be done as he may deem
necessary to make safe such excavation, property, building or other structure.
      (Ord. 1947-58. Passed 11-17-58)
1323.11 PROTECTION AND RELOCATION OF SEWERS AND DRAINAGE COURSES.
   (a)   If, in the opinion of the Director of Public Service, it is necessary
to adjust, relocate, add to, or otherwise modify the existing sewer system or
drainage course serving the area affected by an excavation or fill operation
area or protecting the existing sewer system or drainage course from damage, a
permit shall be issued in accordance with this Chapter only if the applicant
for the permit obtains a permit to provide, relocate, or modify the sewer
system or drainage course for the affected area pursuant to the regulations
under this Code.
   In places where existing sewerage is adequate, but in the opinion of the
Director of Public Service is of doubtful strength to carry additional loading,
the Commissioner shall issue a permit in accordance with this Chapter only if
the applicant for the permit provided written approval from the Director of
Public Service.
(Ord. 5641-86. Passed 5-19-86)
   (b)   When the surface of a lot or plot is excavated, filled or graded,
positive drainage shall be provided so that a nuisance will not be created.
Catch basins or properly connected under- drains shall be installed, or other
approved provisions made, where water may pocket, to preclude the accumulation
of surface water. Surface water shall not be drained onto adjacent properties
not in the same ownership without written permission from the owner of the
adjacent property, and existing natural ground drainage of the ground area
surrounding the lot or plot excavated, filled or graded shall not be impeded.
(Ord. 1947-58. Passed 11-17-58)

other structure, the safety of which may be affected by the excavation, shall
be granted permission to enter the premises where the excavation is to be made
and, at his own expense, shall maintain, support and protect his building or
other structure.
   (b)   Excavations More Than Nine Feet Below Grade Level. When an excavation
extends more than nine feet (9 ft.) below the grade level nearest the point of
excavation under consideration, the person causing the excavation to be made,
if granted permission to enter the adjoining premises, shall, at his own
expense, maintain, support and protect any existing building or other
structure, the safety of which may be affected by that part of the excavation
which extends to a depth greater than nine feet (9 ft.) below the grade level
nearest the point of excavation under consideration, whether or not the
existing building or other structure extends to a depth of nine feet (9 ft.) or
more below grade level. If the necessary permission is not granted to the
person causing such excavation to be made, it shall be the duty of the owner of
the building or other structure to provide such necessary support and
protection, and such owner shall, if necessary, be granted permission to enter
the premises where the excavation is to be made.
   (c)   Support of Party Walls. A party wall, the safety of which may be

1333.01 TITLE.
   This Chapter shall be known as "The Real Property Maintenance Code of the
City of Bedford," and may be referred to hereafter in this Chapter as "this
Code".
(Ord. 4421-75. Passed 2-16-76)
1333.02 FINDINGS; POLICY.
   Council and the Administration of the City are deeply concerned about
environmental problems developing within closely built-up urban areas. It is
the desire of Council, therefore, to provide for the residents of this City, a
clean, healthy, safe and protected environment in which to live. There have
been found to exist within the City premises and structures used for
residential and non-residential use which are substandard, and such conditions
as viewed exhibit exterior structural deterioration, lack of maintenance and
appearance of premises and land area, a disregard for proper maintenance of
business and industrial property areas in storage of equipment and supplies,
existence of fire hazards and unsightly, unsanitary conditions, which
constitute a menace and threat to the health, safety, morals, public welfare,
comfort and well-being of the people of the City.
   Council hereby declares that because of the lack of property maintenance of
the exterior of structures and premises, and permissive and progressive
property deterioration, certain properties within this City are creating
blighting conditions, initiating slums and fostering an unsanitary and
unsightly environment.
   Council believes that unless these blighting, deteriorating, unsanitary and
unsightly conditions, factors and characteristics are curtailed, removed and
prevented from occurring in the future, they will lead to the continuation,
extension and aggravation of urban blight. It is also the intent of this
Chapter to maintain a healthful and esthetically pleasing community.
(Ord. 4421-75. Passed 2-16-76)
1333.03 PURPOSES.
   The purpose of this Real Property Maintenance Code is to protect the public
health, safety and welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the
maintenance, appearance and conditions of all residential and nonresidential
premises; to fix certain responsibilities and duties upon owners and operators;
to authorize and establish procedures for the inspection of residential and
nonresidential premises; and to fix penalties for the violations of this Code.
This Code is hereby declared to be remedial and essential for the public
interest and it is intended that this Code be liberally construed to effectuate
the purposes stated herein.

after the enactment of this Code, and irrespective of any permits or licenses
which have been issued for the use or occupancy of the building or for the
installation or repair of equipment or facilities prior to the effective date
of this Code (Ordinance 4421-75, passed February 16, 1976). This Code
establishes minimum standards for the initial and continued occupancy and use
of all such buildings and does not replace or modify standards otherwise
established for the construction, repair, alteration or use of the building,
except as provided in subsection (b) hereof. Where there is mixed occupancy,
the residential or nonresidential use therein shall be nevertheless regulated
by and subject to the provisions of this Code.
   (b)   Conflict of Laws. In any case where the provisions of this Code impose
a higher standard than that set forth in any other ordinance of the City or
under the laws of the State, then the standards as set forth herein shall
prevail, but if the provisions of this Code impose a lower standard than the
standard set forth in any other ordinance of the City or laws of the State,
then the ordinance or law shall prevail.
   (c)   Enforcement of and Compliance With Other Ordinances. No license or
permit or other certification of compliance with this Code shall constitute a
defense against any violation or any other ordinance of the City applicable to
any structure or premises, nor shall any provision herein relieve any owner,
operator or occupant from complying with any such other provision, or any
official of the City from enforcing any such other provision.
   
   (d)   Exceptions. Owners of vacant property or lots are excused from
compliance with any provision of this Code relating to landscaping under

   (a)   When Inspections are to be Made; Residential and Nonresidential. All
buildings and premises subject to this Code are subject to inspections at all
reasonable times from time to time by the enforcing officer of the City. At the
time of such inspections, all exterior parts of the premises must be available
and accessible for such inspections, and the owner, operator and occupant are
required to provide the necessary arrangements to facilitate such inspections.
Such inspections shall be made during regular open hours of the business
occupying the premises unless there is reason to believe a violation exists of
a character which is an immediate threat to health or safety requiring
inspection and abatement without delay. No person shall refuse to grant the
Building Commissioner or his agent access to the property or otherwise impede
or prevent such Officer or his agent from conducting an inspection of the
premises.
   (b)   Conduct of Inspectors. Inspectors shall conduct themselves so as to
avoid intentional embarrassment or inconvenience to occupants.
   (c)   Where Access by Inspectors is Refused. In addition to the penalty
provided in Section
1333.99 for refusing to grant access for inspection or for impeding or
preventing inspection, the Building Commissioner may, upon affidavit, apply to
the Bedford Municipal Court for a search warrant setting forth factually the
actual conditions and circumstances that provide a reasonable basis for
believing that a nuisance or violation of this Code exists on the premises,
and, if the Court is satisfied as to the matter set forth in the affidavit, the
Court may authorize the issuance of a search warrant permitting access to and
inspection of that part of the premises on which the nuisance or violation
exists. A warrant for access may be issued by the Court upon affidavit of the
Building Commissioner establishing grounds therefor.
   (d)   Procedure Where Violation Discovered.
      (1)   Notice of violation. Where a violation of this Code or the
regulations promulgated pursuant to authority granted in this Code is found to
exist, a written notice from the Building Commissioner shall be served on the
person responsible for the correction thereof.
      (2)   Service of notice. Notice may be served personally or by prepaid
telegram or by mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the last known address
of the person to be served. Where it is ascertained that the owner does not
reside on the premises, the “last known address” shall be the address of the
owner as shown in the office of the County Auditor. If the last known address
cannot be ascertained, the notice may be posted on the outside front entrance
of the building. The Building Commissioner shall file and provide notice to any
owner or operator of any violation at any address other than the last known
address provided hereunder if such other address is filed with the Building
Commissioner personally or by certified mail addressed to the Building
Commissioner. Date of service of the notice shall be determined where service
is by mail as of the second (2nd) day following the day of mailing for notice
to addresses within the City, and as of the seventh (7th) day after the day of
mailing for notices to addresses outside the City. Where the day of service
would fall upon a Sunday or other day when mail is not ordinarily delivered,
then the day of service shall be the next regular delivery day. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Code, where premises are subject to registration
pursuant to Section
1333.12, and have been so registered, notice served upon the agent designated
therein shall constitute service upon the owner, operator and lessor of the
premises, jointly and severally. Where the owner, operator or lessor has failed
to register the premises as required under Section
1333.12, or if the present premises have been registered, and if the agent
designated therein cannot be found at the address given in the registration,
the owner, operator or lessor affected thereby may be served by posting notice
upon the premises in a conspicuous place as near as possible to the front
entrance thereof.
      (3)   Notice to become an order unless hearing before the Board of
Building Code Appeals requested. Within ten (10) days of the date of service of
a notice, the notice shall constitute a final order unless any person affected
by the notice requests a hearing thereon, before the Board of Building Code
Appeals, and serves a written request within the ten (10) day period in person
or by mail on the Chairman of the Board of Building Code Appeals. Such request
for a hearing before the Board shall set forth briefly the grounds or reasons
on which the request for a hearing is based and the factual matters contained
in the notice of violation which are to be disputed at the hearing. The
Chairman of the Board, upon receipt of the request, shall, within thirty (30 )
days therefrom and upon five (5) days notice to the party aggrieved, set the
matter down for hearing.
      (4)   Determination at hearing. At any hearing provided hereunder, the
Chairman of the Board of Building Code Appeals shall be vested with all the
powers provided by law to compel the attendance of witnesses and parties in
interest by issuance and service of subpoena, to require by subpoena the
production of books, records or other documents at any such hearing which may
be pertinent to matters to be determined by him and to enforce any such
subpoena or secure any order for the enforcement of any such subpoena as
provided by law. Determination shall be made within ten (10) days from the
completion of the hearing. The Board shall issue an order either incorporating
the determinations and directions contained in the notice, modifying the same
or withdrawing the notice of extending the time of the same.
      (5)   Extension of time. The Building Commissioner may extend the time
for correction or abatement of the violations for an additional period of time
not to exceed thirty (30) days except where major capital improvements or
renovations are involved, in which instance the time for completion may be
extended for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days beyond the expiration date
of the original notice or the final decision of the Board of Building Code
Appeals.
      (6)   Noncompliance with notice. Whenever the owner, agent, occupant or
operator of a structure or premises fails, neglects or refuses to comply with
any notice of the Building Commissioner that becomes a final order as provided
in paragraph (d)(3) hereof, the Building Commissioner may advise the Director
of Law or the Prosecutor of the circumstances and request the Director of Law
or the Prosecutor to institute an appropriate action at law to compel
compliance.

(Ord. 4421-75. Passed 2-16-76)
1333.10 POWERS AND DUTIES OF BUILDING COMMISSIONER.
   (a)   Adoption of Rules and Regulations by Building Commissioner. The
Building Commissioner is hereby authorized to promulgate such written rules and
regulations as may be necessary for the proper interpretation and
administration of the provisions of this Chapter, provided that such rules and
regulations do not conflict with this Chapter and conform to the general
standards prescribed by this Chapter. The Building Commissioner shall file
copies of such rules and regulations with the Clerk of Council, the City
Engineer, the Fire Chief, the Planning, Zoning, Building Codes and Legislation
Committee of Council and the Board of Building Code Appeals and shall make
available in the Building Commissioner's office a copy for inspection by
members of the public during regular business hours.
   (b)   Power to Vary or Modify Provisions of this Code. The Board of Building
Code Appeals shall have the power to withhold or extend strict enforcement of
the requirements of this Real Property Maintenance Code upon written
application therefor by an owner, operator or occupant, and after a public
hearing, provided that the Board of Building Code Appeals determines that the
following conditions exist:
      (1)   Health or safety hazard. Any variation or modification of a
structure or use approved by the Building Commissioner will not in any material
way alter the standards of this Code and cannot affect detrimentally the health
or safety of occupants or the health, safety or welfare of the occupants or
owners of adjacent premises or of the immediate neighborhood.
         A.    Strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on the owner or operator because it would compel expenditures on the
premises which would be substantially disproportionate to any benefit to
health, safety or welfare that might be derived therefrom.
         B.    The strict enforcement of the provisions of this Code would
require the installation or repair and improvements estimated to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) in cost.
      (2)   Acquisition of premises by public agency. The premises subject to
this Code are contemplated for acquisition or are within an area where
acquisition is contemplated by a public agency having the power of eminent
domain and there is a reasonable likelihood that the premises will be acquired
and razed or moved within a period of two years (2 yrs.), provided, however,
that any waiver of the provisions of this Code shall be canceled and the
Building Commissioner shall strictly enforce this Code if it is ascertained
subsequent to the granting of the waiver that the premises are in fact not to
be acquired for any public use or purpose.
      (3)   Notice. Notice of the time and place of the meeting of the Board of
Building Code Appeals, after an application has been filed under the provisions
of this Section, shall be sent to all property owners within a five hundred
foot (500 ft.) radius of the property for which the application is made. Notice
shall be sent by the Clerk of Commissions by regular mail.
      (4)   Record of variations or modifications granted. Where variations or
modifications are approved in any Section of this Code by the action of the
Board of Building Code Appeals or of any court of record, a written record
thereof, stating the name of the applicant, the address of the premises, the
variation or modification approved, the date of approval and the reasons
therefor, satisfying the provisions contained herein, shall be prepared by the
Building Commissioner and filed both under the Section or Sections of this Code
to which the variation or modification applies and under the address of the
premises, and such files shall be available for public inspection in the office
of the Building Commissioner during regular business hours.
   (c)   Annual Review of Code Provisions and Operations. The Building
Commissioner shall, in the month of May of each year, review with the Fire
Chief, the City Engineer and the Director of Law the procedures and operations
of this Real Property Maintenance Code and report to Council on or before
September 15:
      (1)   Any recommended amendment, addition or modification of the
provisions of this Code consonant with the field experience of the personnel
charged with enforcement;
      (2)   A summary of the time sequence of enforcement experience,
indicating the number of violations abated, the number of cases processed in
the Municipal Court, the number of inspections made and such other and further
pertinent information as will provide Council with an annual account of
progress in securing the standards required by this Code; and
      (3)   Any further recommendation as to how the Code and the procedures
and operations thereunder can be improved.
         (Ord. 4421-75. Passed 2-16-76)

   (a)   Application for Inspection. Whenever an owner, operator, occupant,
bona fide prospective purchaser, mortgagee or bona fide prospective occupant
applies to the Building Commissioner for an inspection in order to ascertain if
any Section of this Code has been violated, the Building Commissioner shall,
upon payment of the fee hereunder stated, cause an inspection to be made of the
premises and issue an informational certificate or report of the inspection to
the applicant, indicating therein any violation of this Real Property
Maintenance Code on the premises. The applicant for such inspection shall state
in writing his full name and address and the reasons and basis for which the
inspection is requested. The Building Commissioner may deny the application for
failure to comply with this requirement.
   (b)   Application for Status Resort.  Where, in lieu of an inspection, an
owner, operator, occupant, lessee, bona fide prospective purchaser mortgagee or
bona fide prospective occupant requests a status report as to whether or not
there are any known violations presently pending on the premises, upon payment
of the fee prescribed herein and the written request, a copy of any notice or
order on any violation then pending shall be sent to the applicant.
   (c)   Significance and Scope of Inspection or Status Report. No inspection
report issued under subsection (a) hereof or status report under subsection (b)
hereof shall be construed as providing a defense against any violation of this
Code or any other ordinance of the City which may be discovered thereafter
whether or not the condition or violation existed at the time of any such
inspection or status report. The inspection or status report is provided an a
convenience to the public and shall not constitute a limitation on the full
enforcement of this Code. The inspection or status report shall include only
such matters as are embraced in this Code.

provisions of the Codified Ordinances of the City applicable to the
construction, alteration, maintenance, repair, use or operation of commercial

occupancy permit subject to the correction of all violation within a specified
period of time. Such qualified permit shall be issued only upon an agreement
signed by the owner of the commercial structure or his agent, or other person
responsible for maintenance or repair of the structure, specifying a time
period for completion of such corrections, not to exceed ninety (90) days,
which period has been approved by the Building Commissioner. Failure to correct

residential areas or public recreation areas, no odor concentration of twenty
odor units shall be permitted for a period of fifteen minutes in any one hour
for three days per month.
   The odor unit is determined by the American Society for Testing Materials
method D1391-57, modified by techniques employed by the Department of Air

1341.09 STORAGE OF JUNK VEHICLES.
   (a)   As used in this section “junk motor vehicle” means any motor vehicle
which is three years or older; extensively damaged, such damage including but
not limited to any of the following: missing wheels, tires, motor or
transmission; apparently inoperable; or having a fair market value of four
hundred dollars ($400.00) or less, that is left uncovered in the open on
private property for more than seventy-two hours with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property, except if the person
is operating a junk yard or scrap metal processing facility licensed under
authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12, or regulated under the authority of
the Municipality; or if the property on which the motor vehicle is left is not
subject to licensure or regulation by any governmental authority, unless the
person having the right to the possession of the property can establish that
the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide commercial operation; or if the motor
vehicle is a collector’s vehicle, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F).
   (b)   No person shall be prevented from storing or keeping, or restricted in
the method of storing or keeping, any operable collector’s vehicle on private

housed in a garage or other suitable structure or shall be removed from the
property.
   (d)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the
open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of
thirty days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a
separate offense.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense, on a second offense, such person is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the fourth degree; on each subsequent offense such person is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

which the nuisance originated.

property or on public property caused by a private property owner or to
otherwise provide a service for which there is no general public benefit, the
cost of providing such service shall not be less than the actual City costs
involved, but in no case shall the cost be less than ten dollars ($10.00) per

any part thereof, that may be necessary to provide a clear and unobstructed
view of traffic from all directions at any street intersection, or abate any

      (1)   The owner, occupant or person having the charge or management of
any lot or parcel of land situated within the City, whether the same be vacant
or occupied, within three days of written notice including posting the
property, shall cut or destroy, or cause to be cut or destroyed, any noxious or
poisonous weeds or tall grasses growing upon such lot or parcel of land, and
prevent the same from blooming or going to seed, exceeding a height of five
inches, or spreading pollen which may be harmful to human health.

the cost of such cutting or destroying of noxious weeds or tall grasses, which
notice shall be accompanied by a statement of the amount of cost incurred. If

         A.   Detention or retention basins or subsurface storage areas.
         B.   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction.
         C.   Induced infiltration of increased storm water runoff into soil,
(where practical); for example, constructing special infiltration areas where
soils are suitable or providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency
overflow facilities. Soil limitations shall be determined by the current
edition of the Cuyahoga Soil and Water Conservation District survey by the Soil
Conservation Service, USDA.
      (5)   The runoff rate from the development area shall not be greater
after development than it was before development. The applicant shall provide
calculations to the City Building Commissioner, to be approved by the City
Engineer, proving no increase in the runoff rates from the two, five, ten,
twenty-five, fifty, and 100 year frequency storms.
      (6)   Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by further
restricting runoff rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the applicant
shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The runoff rate
from the critical storm and all shorter duration storms shall be restricted to
the one (1) year pre-development storm runoff rates.
      (7)   The design criteria shall be applied to each watershed within the
development area.
      (8)   A paved channel for low water flow is required across all detention
basins for each point source into the basin.
      (9)   Velocity dissipation shall be placed at the outfall structures of
all detention or retention basins and along the length of any outfall channel
as necessary to provide a non-erosive flow velocity from the structure to a
water course.
      (10)   Storm Water Management Detention Basins and facilities may be
designed to serve the dual purpose of a sediment trap during construction and
post construction.
      (11)   Storm sewer design for a ten year storm using the Rational Method
to estimate the storm runoff rate "Q". Use Cleveland Regional Rainfall
Intensity Frequency Duration Curves for this region.
      (12)   For sites which are currently developed and are scheduled to be
re- developed, the increase between pre-developed and post-developed runoff
shall be used for critical storm and volume storage calculations.
   (f)   Complete flood routing calculations will be required to confirm that
the proposed detention basin facility meets the above criteria. As a minimum,
the flood routing calculations shall include the following information:
      (1)   Overall Drainage Plan of the site showing existing and proposed
grading, existing and proposed runoff flow paths and drainage facilities,
contributing areas draining to the drainage system and predominant soil types.
      (2)   Plan View, typical cross-sections and pertinent details of the
proposed detention basin and its primary and emergency outlet control
structures.
      (3)   Detention Basin Reservoir Capacity vs. Reservoir Water Surface

the one year storm, the CRITICAL STORM and all storms exceeding the CRITICAL
STORM. The required inflow hydrographs shall include both pre development and
post-development conditions.
      (6)   The assumptions and/or calculations utilized in determining the
inflow hydrographs in accordance with the accepted hydrologic method.
      (7)   Hydraulic Gradient Calculations for the proposed storm drainage
system emptying into the detention basin based on the CRITICAL STORM design
year and other storm design year frequencies as may be required by the City
Engineer.
   (g)   There are additional Post Construction Management requirements for
construction areas of over five (5) acres of land as follows:
      (1)   Area smaller then five (5) acres shall be included when they are
part of a larger plan. The additional requirements shall be incorporated into
the permanent drainage system for the site. The detention basin must be sized
to treat Water Quality Volume (WQV) and comply with Ohio Water Quality
Standards in Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Chapter 3745-1.
      (2)   The Water Quality Volume shall be equivalent to the volume of
runoff from a 0.75 inch rainfall and shall be determined using the following
equation:
         WQV =CxPxA/12
      Where: WQV = water quality volume in acre-feet
      C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than 1 inch (see Table
2)
      P = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
      A = area draining into the basin in acres
 
TABLE 2
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Resident (>8 dwellings/acre)          0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
 
Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should be calculated
using a weighted average. For example, if 60% of the contributing drainage area
to the storm water treatment structure is Low Density Residential, 30% is High
Density Residential, and 10% is Open Space, the runoff coefficients calculated
as follows (0.6) (0.3) + (0.1) (0.2) = 0.35.
      (3)   An additional volume equal to 20% of the WQV shall be incorporated
into dry basin size for sediment storage. Additional methods to assure long
term water quality will be considered on a case by case basis.
      (4)   Whatever method is used the system shall be designed such that the
drain time is long enough to provide treatment, but short enough to provide
storage available for successive rainfall events as described in Table 3 below.
TABLE 3
Target Draw Down (Drain) Times for Structural
Post-Construction Treatment Control Practices
Detention System                            Drain Time
Infiltration                                24-48 hours
Vegetated Swale and Filter Strip            24 hours
Extended Detention Basin (Dry Basins)       48 hours
Retention Basins (Wet Basins)*              24 hours
Constructed Wetlands (above permanent pool) 24 hours
Media Filtration, Bioretention              40 hours
*Provide both a permanent pool and an extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized at 0.75 * WQV.
      (5)   For redevelopment projects (i.e., developments on previously
developed property), post-construction practices shall either ensure a 20
percent net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at
least 20 percent of the WQV, or a combination of the two.

      (Ord. 7665-04. Passed 1-17-05.)
1345.08 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR STORM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLAN.
   (a)   The minimum standards set forth below are general guidelines and shall
not limit the right of the City to impose, at any time, additional, more
stringent requirements, nor shall the criteria limit the right of the approving
authority to waive, in writing, individual requirements. Erosion and sediment
control (Storm Water Pollution Prevention) practices used to satisfy the
minimum standards set forth below shall meet the specifications in the latest
edition of Rainwater and Land Development:, Ohio's Standards for Stormwater
Management Land Development and Urban Stream Protection (available from Ohio
Department of Natural Resources, Division of Soil and Water Conservation) or
other local requirements, whichever is more stringent.
   (b)   In order to control soil erosion and sediment pollution of water
resources, the owner or the person responsible for the development area shall
include these minimum practices to maintain the level of conservation
established by the following standards:
      (1)   All soil erosion and sediment control practices shall be functional
throughout all phases of earth disturbing activity. Settling facilities,
perimeter controls, and other practices intended to trap sediment shall be
implemented as the first step of grading and within seven (7) days from the
start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the development area
is permanently restabilized.
      (2)   Clearing and Grubbing will be done in two (2) or more phases. The
first phase will include only those locations necessary to install the
perimeter soil erosion and sediment and storm water control practices. After
the perimeter controls are in place and functioning the remaining phase(s) of
Clearing and Grubbing may continue.
      (3)   Denuded areas shall have soil stabilization applied within no more
than seven (7) days if they are to remain dormant for more than forty-five (45)
days. Permanent or temporary soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded
areas within no more than seven (7) days after final grade is reached on any
portion of the site.
      (4)   Concentrated storm water runoff from denuded areas flowing at rates
that exceed the design capacity of sediment barriers shall pass through a
sediment settling facility.
         A.   The facility's storage capacity shall be no less than sixty-seven
(67) cubic yards per acre of total drainage area. Trapping efficiency should be
at least 75%.
         B.   Permanent Storm Water Management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment laden water. Velocity dissipation devices shall be placed at the
outfall channel as necessary to provide a nonerosive flow velocity from the
structure to a watercourse.
      (5)   Sheet and rill flow runoff from denuded areas shall be diverted to
a settling pond or treated by a geotextile silt fence or other approved
sediment barrier. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier shall not
exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier.
      (6)   All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove
sediment, unless the storm sewer system drains to a settling facility.
Geotextile fabric under grates is not acceptable.
      (7)   Working In or Crossing Streams:
         A.   Streams including bed and banks shall be restabilized immediately
after in channel work is completed, interrupted, or stopped. To the extent
practicable, construction vehicles shall be kept out of streams. Where in-
channel work is necessary, precautions shall be taken to stabilize the work
area during construction to minimize erosion.
         B.   If a live (wet) stream must be crossed by construction vehicles
regularly during construction, a temporary stream crossing shall be provided.
Temporary stream crossings shall have hydraulic capacity and/or overflow
capability to prevent upstream flooding.
      (8)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil and other solids and
pollutants from being transported onto surfaces where runoff is not checked by
sediment controls, or onto public roads. Minimize such tracking by installing
gravel construction entrances. Where such materials are transported onto a
public road surface, the roads shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each
day, or more frequently as required by the City Service Director. Said
materials shall be removed from paved surfaces by shoveling or sweeping. Street
washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or sweeping has removed most
sediment.
      (9)   Sloughing and Dumping.
         A.   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may readily slough,
slip, or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is
authorized by the City Engineer, and, when applicable, the US Army Corps of
Engineers, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion control structures.
         B.   Unstable soils prone to slipping or landsliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
done in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's recommendations to
correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
      (10)   Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and constructed in a manner
which will minimize erosion. Consideration shall be given to the length and
steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope drainage area, groundwater
conditions, and slope stabilization.
      (11)   Outfalls and constructed or modified channels shall be designed
and constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from a post
development, ten-year (or greater) frequency storm without eroding.
      (12)   A permanent vegetative cover shall be established on denuded areas
not otherwise permanently stabilized. Permanent vegetation shall not be
considered established until ground cover is achieved which, in the opinion of
the City Engineer, covers eighty percent (80%) or more of the soil surface and
provides adequate cover and is mature enough to control soil erosion
satisfactorily and to survive adverse weather conditions.
      (13)   A riparian zone of the minimum depth of 25 feet measured on a
flat, level line at right angles to the high-water mark of the stream or
wetland shall be maintained as virgin, undisturbed area along any existing
creek, stream, waterway or wetland area. Should a virgin area not be manageable
due to proposed grade changes or other proposed site work the City Engineer may
approve the design and installation of a landscaping plan intended to replace
the existing plant growth. The City Engineer shall be authorized to waive the
minimum 25-foot dimension in specific locations on a site where a hardship can
be shown to exist and where other acceptable, permanent means of filtering
runoff can be provided.
      (14)   All temporary erosion and sediment control practices shall be
disposed of within thirty days after final site stabilization is achieved or
after the temporary practices are no longer needed, unless otherwise authorized
by the City Building Commissioner upon a written recommendation of the City
Engineer. Trapped sediment shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further
erosion, or removed from the site.
      (15)   All erosion and sediment control practices shall be designed and
constructed to minimize maintenance requirements. They shall be maintained and
repaired as needed to assure continued performance of their intended function.
Sediment and erosion controls shall be inspected by the applicant or his
designee once every 7 days and within 24 hours of 0.5 inch or greater rainfall
amount. The applicant or his designee must keep a written log of these
inspections. This log should indicate the date of inspection, name of
inspector, weather conditions, observations, actions taken to correct any
problems and the date action was taken. Upon a request of the City Engineer the
owner shall submit these documents.
      (16)   During construction of underground utility lines, pipes etc.
Trench dewatering devices shall discharge in an approved manner that will not
adversely affect water resource or off-site property.
      (17)   If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permits, a copy of all the
required inspection sheets shall be submitted to the City Building Commissioner
within 2 working days of the date that the inspection was conducted.
         (Ord. 7665-04. Passed 1-17-05.)

properly maintain an installation or when the number of false alarms for any
installation equals ten in any twelve month period, the Chief of Police and/or

revoke his permit. Such notice shall be given not less than seven days prior to
revocation. Such notice shall state the right of the permit holder to appeal to
the City Manager. If an appeal is filed in writing, the City Manager shall hold
a hearing on the matter and shall render a decision on the basis of the facts
presented. The City Manager’s decision shall be final. In the event no appeal
is filed, the Chief of Police and/or the Chief of Fire shall transmit all

Chief of Police and/or the Chief of Fire shall take whatever steps are
necessary to disconnect the alarms.

paid to the City for each permit issued as provided herein, to cover

excuse the violation or permit it to continue, and all such persons shall be
required to correct or remedy such violations or defects within a reasonable
time. When not otherwise specified, each day that prohibited conditions are
maintained shall constitute a separate offense.
   (b)   The application of the above penalty shall not be held to prevent the

respect to the gravity of the violation, the good faith of the person being
charged, and the history of previous violations shall be given whenever a
penalty is assessed under this chapter.
      (5)   For purposes of this section, a serious violation shall be
considered to exist if there is a substantial probability that an occurrence
causing death or serious physical harm to persons could result from a condition
which exists, or from one or more practices, means, methods, operations or
processes which have been adopted or are in use, unless the person did not and
could not with the exercise of reasonable diligence, know of the presence of
the violation.
   (d)   Civil penalties imposed by this chapter shall be paid for deposit into
the General Revenue Fund of the City. Such penalties may be recovered in a
civil action in the name of the State brought in the Court of Common Pleas of

1907.01 PROCEDURE.
   In planning and developing a subdivision, the general principles and
requirements set forth in Chapter
1909 shall be observed and in every case the following procedure shall be
pursued:
   (a)   Sketch Plan. The developer or his engineer shall first submit the
proposed plat in sketch form to the Building Commissioner and the City Manager
to ascertain the location of proposed streets, parks or other planned
developments and their conformance with the City’s Master Plan.
    (b)   Preliminary Plat.
      (1)   The developer, after submitting the plat in sketch form to the City
Manager, shall prepare a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision and
construction plans for improvements adequate to determine that sewer, water and
street construction can be installed conforming with the requirements set forth
in Chapter
1913. The developer shall file with the Building Commissioner an application in
writing seeking the approval of the plat, accompanied by four (4) black or blue
line prints. The Building Commissioner, in conjunction with the City Engineer,
shall review the preliminary plat for conformance with City ordinances. The
application shall be submitted at least three weeks (3 weeks) prior to a
regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission.
      (2)   The Building Commissioner, in conjunction with the City Engineer,
will then check the preliminary plat as to its conformity with the Codified
Ordinances, Transportation Plan, Community Facilities Plan, other adopted parts
of the City Plan and the principles, standards and requirements set forth in
these Subdivision Regulations. The City Engineer will review the construction
plans for all proposed improvements.
      (3)   The Planning Commission, upon receipt from the Building
Commissioner and City Engineer of any recommendations and/or advice concerning
the above matters, will recommend to City Council the approval, approval with
modifications or disapproval of the preliminary plat. The Commission will note
on the plat any changes that are required, and will forward the plat to the
Clerk of Council with the date of recommendation endorsed thereon. Upon the
approval or disapproval of the plat by City Council, the Clerk of Council will
forward all copies of the plat to the Building Commissioner for distribution.
One copy of the drawing will be retained by both the Building Department and by
the City Engineer.
      (4)   The preliminary plat will be submitted to Council for acceptance or
rejection along with the recommendations of the Planning Commission, the
Building Commissioner and the City Engineer.
   (c)   Final Plat.
      (1)   The developer, after approval of the Preliminary Plat by City
Council, shall direct his design professional to prepare a final plat of the
subdivision. The Final Plat shall be a complete set of construction drawings
and shall include all elevations, sections, specifications and all other
information necessary to completely construct the project. The final plat shall
conform in every respect with the requirements specified in Section
1911.03. In the case of condominium construction, a final draft of the
condominium association agreement shall be submitted at this time for review by
the City Law Director. The developer shall submit the final plat (with
condominium agreement if applicable) not later than six months after approval
of the Preliminary Plat by City Council. Construction shall then begin within
one year from approval of the Final Plat. Failure to submit the Final Plat and
to begin construction within the specified time period will render null and
void any and all approvals by the Building Commissioner, the City Engineer and
City Council.
      (2)   The developer shall present five (5) black or blue line prints, and
an original copy of the final or record plat, with a formal request for
approval thereof.
      (3)   The Building Commissioner and the City Engineer will check the
final plat, and plans and specifications for improvements. If found
satisfactory, the original tracing will be returned to the developer with the
approval stamp of the City Engineer and the Building Commissioner.
      (4)   After receiving notification from the City Engineer that the
improvements are in order and being satisfied the final plat is in conformity
with the approved preliminary plat and these Subdivision Regulation, the
Building Commissioner shall approve the final plat and forward it to the City
Engineer for the appropriate action in recording the plat.
   (d)   Improvements. The developer, after approval of the Final Plat:
      (1)   May secure from the Building Commissioner the necessary permits to
proceed with the streets, curbs and other improvements;
         (Ord. 7435-01. Passed 2-18-02.)
      (2)   Shall, to insure the satisfactory installation in conformance with
approved plans and specifications and the City's regulations, post with the
Building Department a performance bond in a form approved by the Law Director
sufficient to cover the full cost of the work involved based upon an estimate
approved by the City Engineer. This bond shall be for the benefit of the City
only, is not assignable, and shall not create any third-party beneficiaries.
(Ord. 9105-13. Passed 9-3-13.)
      (3)   Shall agree to begin construction of the project within one year (1
yr.) of receiving approval of the Final Plat, and shall thereafter not cause
construction to cease for more than a six-month period at any time during the
construction. Failure to begin with and continue the construction as specified
will render null and void any and all approvals by the Building Commissioner,
the City Engineer and City Council.
   (e)   Maintenance Bond and Fees.
      (1)   Upon acceptance of the work, the developer shall post a maintenance

1909.01 CONFORMITY TO TRANSPORTATION, COMMUNITY FACILITIES AND CITY PLANS.
   In laying out a subdivision, the developer shall comply with the following
general principles and requirements:
   (a)   The layout shall conform to the Transportation Plan and other parts of
the adopted City Plan.
      (1)   Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a highway,
primary or secondary thoroughfare or parkway, so designated on the
Transportation Plan, such part of the public way shall be platted by the
developer in the location and at the width indicated on such Plan.
      (2)   Where a proposed park, playground or other recreational area,
proposed school site or other public ground, shown on the adopted Community
Facilities Plan or other part of the City Plan, is located in whole or in part
within the proposed subdivision, such proposed public ground or part, if not
dedicated to the City, or the Board of Education, shall be reserved and no
development take place on such land for a period of not less than ninety (90)
days to allow the Council or Board of Education the opportunity to consider and
take action toward acquisition of such public ground or part of by purchase or
other means.
   (b)   Where considered desirable by the developer and held appropriate by
the Planning Commission, open spaces suitably located and of adequate size for
parks, playgrounds or other recreational purposes for local or neighborhood use
shall be provided for in the design of the proposed subdivision, and, if not
dedicated to the public and accepted by the City or Board of Education, may be
reserved for the common use of all property owners in the proposed subdivision
by covenant in the deed.
      (Ord. 7435-01. Passed 2-18-02.)
1909.02 STREET AND BLOCK LAYOUT.
   (a)   The street layout of the subdivision shall be in general conformity
with a plan for the most advantageous development of adjoining areas and the
entire neighborhood.
      (1)   Where appropriate to the design, proposed streets shall be
continuous and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with
which they are to connect.
      (2)   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, such
extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of
the subdivision with existing layouts or the most advantageous future
development of adjacent tracts. Dead-end streets (courts) of reasonable length
will be approved where topography necessitates or where they are appropriate
for the type of development contemplated.
      (3)   Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right
angles as topography and other limiting factors of good design permit.
      (4)   Wherever there exists adjoining the tract to be subdivided a
dedicated or platted and recorded half-width street or alley, the other half-
width of such street or alley shall be platted.
      (5)   Alleys shall be platted in the rear of all lots to be used for
business, and in the rear of residential lots fronting on highways, primary and
secondary thoroughfares or parkways, unless service roads are provided in front
thereof, as means of safe access thereto.
   (b)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers of
lots of appropriate depth, unless, in the opinion of the Planning Commission,
prevented by exceptional topography or other physical conditions.
      (1)   The lengths of blocks shall be such as are appropriate, in the
opinion of the Planning Commission, for the locality and the type of
development contemplated, but shall not exceed one thousand eight hundred feet
(1,800 ft.) where the average size of lots does not exceed two (2) acres in
area.
      (2)   In any block over nine hundred feet (900 ft.) in length, the
Planning Commission may require that a crosswalk or pedestrian way, not less
than ten feet (10 ft.) wide, shall be provided near the center and entirely
across such block.

the Transportation Plan, and the differences, if any, between the cost of the
portion to be provided at the expense of the developer and that of the total
width designated by the Transportation Plan shall be borne by the City unless
it is determined by the Commission that such greater width will benefit the
developer in proportion to its costs. However, the cost of curb and gutter
shall be borne by the developer in any case. The pavement of a turning circle
at the end of the dead-end street shall have a minimum outside diameter of
eighty feet (80 ft.). A "T" or "Y" shaped paved space, when approved by the

(Ord. 7435-01. Passed 2-18-02.)
1909.08 MODIFICATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   The general principles of design and minimum requirements for the
laying out of subdivision, set forth in this chapter may be varied by the
Planning Commission in the case of a subdivision large enough to constitute a
more or less self-contained neighborhood which is to be developed in accordance
with a comprehensive plan safeguard by deed restrictions and agreements with
the City and which, in the judgment of the Commission make adequate provision
for all essential community requirements. However, no modification shall be
granted by the Commission which would conflict with the proposals of the
Transportation Plan, Community Facilities Plan or with the intent and purposes
of the general principles of design and minimum requirements.
   (b)   In any particular case where the developer can show that, by reason of
exceptional topography or other physical conditions, strict compliance with any
requirements of these Subdivision Regulations could cause practical difficulty
or exceptional and undue hardship, the Planning Commission may relax such
requirement to the extent deemed just and proper, so as to relieve such
difficulty or hardship; provided such relief may be granted without detriment
to the public good and without impairing the intent and purposes of these
Subdivision Regulations or the desirable general development of the
neighborhood and the community in accordance with the adopted City Plan and the
Planning and Zoning Code. Any modification thus granted shall be entered in the
minutes of the Commission setting forth the reasons which, in the opinion of
the Commission, justified modification.

            3.    That the proposed use is necessary to serve the surrounding
residential areas which cannot be served satisfactorily if the same use is
located in a nearby less restrictive district where it may be permitted by
right; and
            4.    That the location, design and operation of such use will not
discourage the appropriate development or impair the value of the surrounding
residential district.
         B.    Business, Office and Industrial Districts
            1.    That the proposed use is necessary to serve community needs
and that existing similar facilities located in a less restrictive or more
remote district, in which the use may be permitted by right, are inadequate;
            2.    That the proposed use is not closer than applicable
regulations indicate in the particular situation to schools, churches and other
places of assembly;
            3.    That the location, extent and intensity of the proposed use
shall be such that its operation will not be more objectionable to nearby
dwellings, by reason of noise, smoke, dust, odors, fumes, vibrations or glare,
than is normal or is permitted by the performance standards of the district;
            4.    The proposed use will form a harmonious part of a business,
office or industrial district, taking into account, convenience of access and
the relationship of one use to another;
            5.    That the hours of operation and concentration of vehicles in
connection with the proposed use will not be more hazardous or dangerous than
the normal traffic of the district.
         C.    Safeguards and Conditions. In addition to complying with the
general standards set forth in paragraphs A and B hereof, conditions
appropriate to each particular application may also be set forth in approving a
Conditional Use.
            (Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)

1919.01 ESTABLISHMENT; INTENT.
   A Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby established to assist in the
administration of this Zoning Code, particularly to decide and interpret
provisions which require impartial judgement of conflicting interests and to
grant variances from the strict letter of this Zoning Code when instances of
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship are determined by the Board.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1919.02 CREATION, MEMBERSHIP AND PROCEDURE.
   (a)   A Board of Appeals consisting of five (5) members shall be appointed
by Council in accordance with the provisions of the City
Charter. The appointing authority may remove any member of the Board for cause
and after public hearing.
   (b)   The Board shall elect its own Chairman and have the power to adopt
rules and regulations for its own government, not inconsistent with law or with
the provisions of this or any other City ordinance. Meetings shall be held at
the call of the Chairman and at such other times as the Board may determine.
The Chairman, or in his absence, the Acting Chairman, may administer oaths and
compel the attendance of witnesses.
   (c)   The Clerk of Council shall be the Secretary of the Board. Meetings of
the Board shall be open to the public. Minutes shall be kept of proceedings,
showing the action of the Board and the vote of each member upon each question,
or if absent or failing to vote, indicating that fact, and records shall be
made of the Board's examinations and other official actions, all of which shall
be filed immediately in the office of the Board as a public record. At the end
of each calendar year, the Secretary shall have an annual report of the work of
the Board.
   (d)   Three (3) members of the Board shall constitute a quorum. The Board
shall act by resolution, and the concurring vote of three (3) members shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the
Building Commissioner, or to decide in favor of an applicant any matter upon
which it is required to pass under this Planning and Zoning Code, hereinafter
the "Code".
   (e)   The Board may call on City departments for assistance in the
performance of its duties, and it shall be the duty of such departments to
render such assistance to the Board as may be reasonably required.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1919.03 APPEALS APPLICATIONS AND PROCEDURE.
   (a)   An application to the Board of Appeals, in cases in which it has
original jurisdiction under the provisions of this Code, may be taken by any
property owner, including a tenant, or by any governmental officer, department,
board or bureau. Such application shall be filed with the Secretary of the
Board, together with a filing fee as set by ordinance of Council, who shall
transmit the same, together with all the plans, specifications and other papers
pertaining to the application to the Board, 30 days prior to the desired
regularly scheduled Board of Appeals meeting.
   (b)   An appeal to the Board may be taken by any property owner, including a
tenant, or by any governmental officer, department, board or bureau affected by
any ruling of the Building Commissioner. Such appeal shall be taken within a
reasonable time, as prescribed by the rules of the Board, by filing with the
Building Commissioner a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The
Building Commissioner shall forthwith transmit to the Board such notice of
appeals, together with all the plans and papers constituting the record upon
which the action appealed from was taken.
   (c)   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an
application or of an appeal. It shall give at least fifteen (15) days notice of
the time and place of such hearing by insertion in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City, and shall also give notice delivered by first class
mail at least five (5) days before the time fixed for such hearing to the
applicant or appellant and to the Building Commissioner, and to the respective
owners of record of property within a radius of three hundred fifty feet (350
ft.) of the outer boundary to the property in question. Any party may appear at
such hearing in person or by agent or by attorney. The Board shall decide the
application or appeal within a reasonable time. The failure to receive such
notice shall not invalidate the proceedings.
   (d)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Building Commissioner certifies to the Board that by
reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in his opinion cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by an order which may, on due cause shown, be granted by
the Board on application, after notice to the Building Commissioner, or by a
court of record.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1919.04 POWER'S OF THE BOARD; REVIEW AND VARIANCES.
   Powers Generally. The Board shall have jurisdiction in matters and shall
have the specific and general powers provided in this Code.
   (a)   Special Exceptions and Interpretation of Map. The Board shall have the
power to hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of this Code,
requests or application for special exceptions or for interpretation of the
Zoning Map or for decisions upon other special questions upon which the Board
is authorized to pass.
      (1)   Special Exceptions. In addition to permitting the special
exceptions heretofore specified in this code, the Board shall have authority to
permit the following:
         A.    Nonconforming Uses. The substitution for a nonconforming use of
another nonconforming use, if no structural alterations except those required
by law or ordinance are made, provided, that any use so substituted shall be of
the same or a more restricted classification; and
         B.    Temporary Uses and Permits.
            1.    The temporary use of a building or premises in a district for
a purpose or use that does not conform to the regulations prescribed by this
Code, provided that such use is of a true temporary nature and does not involve
the erection of substantial buildings. Such permit shall be granted in the form
of temporary and revocable permit for not more than a twelve month (12 mo.)
period, subject to such conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety,
convenience and general welfare.
            2.    The temporary use of a building or premises in undeveloped
sections for a purpose that does not conform to the regulations prescribed by
this Code, provided that such structure or use is of a true temporary nature,
is promotive of or incidental to the development of such undeveloped sections,
and does not involve the erection of substantial buildings. Such permit shall
be granted in the form specified under subsection B. 1. hereof.
      (2)   Interpretation of Map. Where the street or lot layout actually on
the ground or as recorded, differs from the street or lot lines indicated on
the Zoning Map, the Board, after notice to the owners of the property and after
public hearing, shall interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the
intent and purposes of this Code for the particular section or district in
question.
   (b)   Administrative Review and Variances. The Board of Appeals also shall
have the power as follows:
      (1)   Administrative Review. To hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged by the appellant that there is error in any order, requirement,
decision, grant or refusal made by the Building Commissioner in the enforcement
of the provisions of this Code.
      (2)   Variances. To authorize on appeal in specific cases such variance
from the terms of this Code as will not be contrary to the public interest,
where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this Code will result in practical difficulty or, in the case of a use variance
unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this Code shall be observed and
substantial justice done, as follows:
         A.    The following factors shall be considered and weighed by the
Board in determining practical difficulty:
            1.    Whether there can be any beneficial use of the property
without the variance;
            2.    Whether the variance is substantial or is the minimum
necessary to make possible the reasonable use of the land or structures;
            3.    Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer substantial
detriment as a result of the variance;
            4.    Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage collection);
            5.   Whether the variance sought is for relief from a zoning
provision which was enacted after the creation of an existing condition or
circumstance to the property in question;
            6.    Whether special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land or structure involved and which are not applicable
generally to other lands or structures in the same Zoning District; examples of
such special conditions or circumstances are: exceptional irregularity,
narrowness, shallowness or steepness of the lot, or adjacency to nonconforming
and inharmonious uses, structures or conditions;
            7.    Whether the property owner's predicament feasiblely can be
obviated through some method other than a variance;
            8.    Whether the granting of the variance will create a
nonconforming lot;
            9.    Whether special conditions or circumstances exist as a result
of actions of the owner and/or applicant;
            10.    Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement
would be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
         B.    No such variance shall be granted to allow a use not permissible
under the terms of this Zoning Code in the zoning district in which the
property is located unless the board finds that the applicant will suffer
unnecessary hardship if strict compliance with the terms of the Code is
required and such hardship must be demonstrated by clear and convincing
evidence as to all of the following criteria:
            (Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
            1.    Where the literal application of the provisions of this
zoning code either do not substantially advance legitimate city interests, or
result in no economically viable use of the property for any purpose for which
the property is zoned and thereby creates unnecessary hardship(s) unique to the
property and not based on conditions created by the owner. (A theoretical loss
or limiting possibilities of economic advantage are general hardships, not
unnecessary hardships);
(Ord. 7497-02. Passed 9-3-02.)
            2.    Where other exceptional circumstances or conditions (such as
topographical or geological conditions, or type of adjoining development) are
unique to the property involved and do not apply to other property within the
same zone unless the same exceptional circumstances exist;
            3.    Where granting of a variance will not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements
in the neighborhood in which the property is located;
            4.    Where the granting of a variance will not be contrary to the
general purpose, intent and objectives of this Zoning Code and the Master Plan
of the City of Bedford; and
            5.    The variance sought is the minimum which will afford relief
to the applicant.
         C.    No grant or variance shall be authorized unless the Board
specifically finds that the condition or situation of the specific piece of
property for which the variance is sought is not of so typical or recurrent a
nature as to make reasonable practicable the formulation of a general
regulation, under an amendment of this Code, for such conditions or situations.
         D.    The Board shall have no power to authorize a variance for the
establishment of a nonconforming use where none previously existed.
         E.    In considering a request for a variance from the regulation
concerning signs, the Board shall give consideration and arrive at a finding on
the following:
            1.    Shape and area of lot in question;
            2.    Bulk and floor area of the main building or structure;
            3.    Setback of proposed sign from all property lines;
            4.    Zoning and use of surrounding parcels;
            5.    Unusual or exceptional topography; and
            6.    Compatibility with general intent of this Code to encourage
development without detracting from the use and enjoyment of surrounding
property.
   (c)   Time Limitations on Construction. All variance or other permits
granted by the Board shall lapse and become void unless the applicant or owner
obtains a building permit within six months (6 mos.) after the granting of the
variance or other permit and unless construction is begun within six months (6
mos.) thereafter. No variance or other permit shall become void without an
opportunity for a hearing by the Board. The Board may grant an extension of
time for good cause shown.
      (Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1919.05 BOARD ACTION BY RESOLUTION.
   (a)   In exercising its powers, the Board of Appeals may, in conformity with
the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code and of this Code, reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as, in the Board's opinion, ought to be made, and to than end all
the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
   (b)   All final actions of the Board shall be by resolution. Such resolution
shall contain:
      (1)   Name and address of the person making the appeal or application;
      (2)   Description of premises involved in the appeal or application, by
block and lot and by street address, and also the zoning district in which
located;
      (3)   Zoning provisions from which an appeal is made, or under which an
application is made;
      (4)   Physical conditions of the premises, or other premises affected,
and of the building or use proposed by the appellant or applicant which are
pertinent to a decision;
      (5)   For a variance, the opinion of the Board as to the degree of
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship; which compliance with provisions
of this Code would place upon the appellant or applicant;
      (6)   For an exception or matter of original jurisdiction, a statement
establishing the qualifications for permitting the requests, subject to such
limits as the Board may impose; and
      (7)   Statement of resolution that the appeal or application be granted,
and the date the action is entered.
         (Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1919.06 JUDICIAL REVIEW.
   All final administrative decisions of the Board of Appeals shall be subject
to judicial review by the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, Ohio.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)

1921.01 AUTHORITY OF COUNCIL; REQUIRED SUBMISSION OF PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO
PLANNING COMMISSION.
   In accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code and the City
Charter, the Council, either on petition of a property owner, on recommendation
of the Planning Commission, or on its own initiative, may amend or change by
ordinance the number, shape or area of districts established on the Zoning Map
as defined in
1923.02 or the regulations set forth in this Planning and Zoning Code,
hereafter the "Code". Except by a three-quarter vote of the full number of
elected voting members of the City specifically waiving the requirement under
special circumstances, no such amendment or change shall become effective
unless the ordinance proposing such amendment or change has first been
submitted to the Planning Commission for approval, disapproval or suggestions,
and the Commission has been allowed a reasonable time, not less than thirty
(30) days, for consideration and report. (Ord. 9661-19. Passed 1-22-19.)
1921.02 PUBLIC HEARING BY COMMISSION; NOTICE.
   (a)    Notice and Public Hearing. Unless waived by Council as stated in
Section
1921.01, before submitting its recommendations and report to Council, the
Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment,
supplement or change. It shall give not less than thirty (30) nor more than
forty-five (45) days notice of the time and place of such hearing by
publication in a newspaper published in the City and by mailing notices to all
property owners directly involved and to all property owners of record within a
radius of three hundred fifty feet (350 ft.) from the area proposed to be
altered. The failure to receive such notice shall not invalidate the
proceedings.
   (b)    The Planning Commission shall, upon completion of the public hearing,
decide upon a recommendation to transmit to Council relative to the proposed
amendment. Such recommendation shall be transmitted by the Secretary within
five (5) days of the Commission's action thereon. (Ord. 9661-19. Passed 1-22-
19.)
1921.03 ZONING CHANGE APPLICATION AND FEE.
   Any person desiring a change in zoning of property may make application
therefor. The application for a zoning change shall be written and accompanied
by a drawing showing the property in question including property improvements
and utilities and a filing fee. Filing fees shall be set by ordinance of
council and amended to reflect the City's costs.
(Ord, 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1921.04 PLANS ON FILE FOR PUBLIC EXAMINATION.
   During the thirty (30) days prior to the public hearing the text or copy of
the text of such ordinance or petition, together with the maps or plans or
copies thereof shall be on file, for public examination, in the office of the
Clerk of Council. No ordinance which differs from the recommendation made by
the Planning Commission shall take effect unless passed by not less than five
(5) affirmative votes of Council.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1921.05 COUNCIL ACTION ON AMENDMENT.
   (a)   Council shall, within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the
Commission's recommendation on the proposed amendment, take official action, in
the form of an ordinance thereon. A majority vote, involving not less than five
(5) members of Council, shall be required to override the recommendation of the
Planning Commission. In all cases not meeting this criteria, the official
action taken on the proposal shall be as recommended by Planning Commission.
   (b)   If protest against an amendment is presented, duly signed by the
owners of at least fifty-one percent of the land within the area proposed to be
altered, such amendment shall not be passed except by two-thirds vote of all
members of Council. If an amendment will transfer an area to a less restricted
district and a protest is presented, duly signed by the owners of at least
fifty-one percent of the land adjacent to and/or within 350 feet of such an
area proposed to be transferred, such amendment shall not be passed except by a
two-thirds vote of Council members.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1921.06 VALIDITY OF UNINTENTIONAL FAILURE TO NOTIFY.
   The failure to notify, as provided by this Chapter, shall not invalidate an
ordinance, provided such failure was not intentional, and the omission of the
name of any owner or occupant of property who may, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, be affected by such amendment, supplement or change,
unless such omission is intentional, shall not invalidate any ordinance passed
hereunder, it being the intention of this Chapter to provide, so far as may be
for notice to the persons substantially interested in the proposed change, that
an ordinance is pending before the Council, proposing to make a change in
zoning.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1921.07 REZONING: TIME LIMITATIONS ON CONSTRUCTION.
   The owner of rezoned property shall obtain a building permit within one year
(1 yr.) of the date of enactment of the rezoning ordinance and shall begin
construction under such permit no later than six months (6 mos.) after the
issuance of the permit. Failure to comply with these time limitations shall
cause the property to revert to the former classification. For good cause the
Planning Commission may extend these periods of time. Land rezoned as part of a
Master Plan by Council or land rezoned at the request of Council for the
benefit of the City as a whole shall not be affected.

   (m)   PRD Planned Residential Developments.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1923.02 DISTRICT BOUNDARY LINES ESTABLISHED ON MAPS.
   (a)   The boundaries of these districts are hereby established as shown on a
map entitled "Zoning Map", which accompanies and is hereby made a part of this
Code. The district boundary lines on the map are intended to follow lot lines,
the center lines of streets or alleys projected, railroad right of way lines,
or the corporate limit lines. Where a district boundary line does not clearly
coincide with lot lines, it shall be determined by scaling.
   (b)   Zoning district boundary lines which cannot be distinctly located from
the Zoning Map are shown in enlarged scale on the accompanying "Zoning Map
Blowups" and are hereby made a part of this Code, and shall take precedence
over the Zoning Map in locating district boundary lines shown on them.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1923.03 BOUNDARY LINE DIVISION OF SINGLE LOT.
   Where a district boundary line divides a lot which was in single ownership
and of record at the time of enactment of that district, the use authorized on
and the other district requirements applying to the less restricted portion of
such lot shall be considered as extending to the entire lot provided that where
the more restricted portion of such lot is more than fifty feet (50 ft.) beyond
such dividing district boundary line, such less restricted use shall be limited
to the portion of the lot lying within fifty feet (50 ft.) of such boundary
line with the exception of the first fifty feet (50 ft.) of frontage on a
street within a Historical District.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1923.04 BOARD DETERMINATION OF EXACT DISTRICT BOUNDARY LINES.
   Questions concerning the exact location of district boundary lines shall be

Final Plan.
   (c)   Approval of Plans. A preliminary development plan designed in
accordance with the planning standards, regulations and criteria established in
this Zoning Code shall be submitted to the Building Commissioner for review and
approval. If found to be in general compliance with this and other sections of
the Codified Ordinances of the City of Bedford, it shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission for their review and approval. If the preliminary
development plan, together with any modifications thereto proposed by the
developer, is found by the Planning Commission to be in compliance with the
requirements of the I-2 District and any other applicable parts of this Zoning
Code, they shall approve such preliminary development plan within 30 days from
the date of the meeting when all required plans and data have been received. If
not found to be in compliance therewith, the Planning Commission may recommend
revisions to be made by the developer who shall act on those recommendations
and resubmit drawings and/or information within 90 days of notification by
Planning Commission. Upon approval of a preliminary development plan, the
developer shall, within 90 days of the preliminary approval, prepare and submit
to the Building Commissioner a final development plan which shall include the
final grading plan, detailed plans and specifications for all streets, storm

by the developer and resubmitted through the same procedure required for the
original preliminary and final development plan. Failure to resubmit revised
drawings or to begin the construction of all or a substantial portion of the
improvements approved in the final development plan within 180 days after the
issuance of a permit, or cessation of construction for longer than a 180 day
period at any time during construction, shall render null and void the plan as
approved unless an extension of time is granted by the Building Commissioner
per item (b) above prior to any expiration.

1943.01 INTENT.
   It is the intent of this Chapter to maintain and enhance the distinctive
character of the Historical Districts, hereinafter referred to as "H-
1 Districts", by safeguarding the architectural integrity of individual
historic structures and sites and by preventing the intrusion of incompatible
development. Furthermore, it is an intent of this Chapter to achieve, among
others, the following related objectives:
   (a)   To foster a sense of community identification and civic pride by
preserving structures and sites which reflect periods and events in the history
of the community and its region;
   (b)   To stimulate the local economy by protecting and strengthening those
historical qualities of the district which can serve to attract customers,
clients and potential employees; and
   (c)   To protect property values and safeguard the quality of life within
the district by preventing environmental changes which diminish the district's
unique historic and architectural character.
      (Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1943.02 OVERLAY DISTRICT ESTABLISHMENT; LANDMARK ESTABLISHMENT.
   H-1 Districts shall be established and amended in accordance with the
standard procedures for amending the zoning map as set forth in the Planning
and Zoning Code, hereinafter "Code". No H-1 District shall be established or
amended prior to review by the Bedford Historic Preservation Board. In the same
way, individual "Local Landmarks" may be recommended by the Bedford Historic
Preservation Board for approval as historic landmark properties which are not
located within an established historic district but which individually convey
the same strong sense of period or history as is described for districts in
Section
1943.07. In reviewing proposals for either historic districts or individual
historic landmarks, the Board shall determine whether the structure or area in
question satisfies the requirements for historic significance as defined in
Section
1943.03 or Section
1943.07.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1943.03 DISTRICT DEFINITION.
   An H-1 District is a concise geographic area in which structures, spaces,
streets and objects collectively convey a strong sense of a period or periods
in history, generally at least fifty years (50 yrs.) in the past. The degree to
which an area conveys a sense of history is dependent upon such factors as the
following:
   (a)   The architectural and aesthetic quality of older buildings in the
area;
   (b)   The prominence of modern development and other development which does
not contribute to the area's historical character;
   (c)   The area's association with events or individuals significant in
history; and
   (d)   The physical linkages which create a sense of place and cohesiveness
throughout the area.
      (Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1943.04 DISTRICT MAPPING. 
   H-1 Districts shall be shown on the "Zone Map of the City of Bedford" as
"overlay" districts to be applied in conjunction with the "underlying"
districts (such as "retail," "single-family residential," etc.). Provisions of
the underlying district shall remain in effect except where inconsistent with
the provisions of H-1 Districts.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1943.05 APPLICABILITY. 
   Within the H-1 Districts, no building or other structure shall be erected,
altered in exterior construction or appearance, enlarged, moved, or demolished
unless such action complies with the provisions of this Chapter. The repainting
of structures designated as a landmark or within an H-1 District shall also be
governed by these regulations. Colors and multi-color schemes shall be subject
to approval by the Historic Preservation Board.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1943.06 PERMITTED USES.
   Within the H-1 Districts, uses shall be permitted as established in the
underlying zoning district.
(Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1943.07 HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE.
   In the administration of this chapter, the historic significance of a
property shall be judged with respect to both the intrinsic significance of the
subject property and its significance in contributing to the character of the
district or area of the City. Specifically, a building, other structure or site
may be deemed historically significant if it is at least fifty years (50 yrs.)
in age and either:
   (a)   Embodies the distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style
associated with the history of the community or region; or
   (b)   Is representative of the work of a notable architect or builder; or
   (c)   Is identified with important persons or events in the history of the
community or region.
      (Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1943.08 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES.
   The following procedures are established to govern the processing of
applications for building permits and other municipal authorizations for
"landmark" historic properties or properties located in H-1 Districts:
   (a)   Contents of Application. In addition to meeting application
requirements established in this Code, applications governed by the provisions
of this Chapter shall include the following elements:
      (1)   Color photograph(s). Showing the subject property in the context of
adjoining properties.
      (2)   Sketch(es). Showing the nature of any construction or exterior
alterations proposed indicating design, materials, colors, type of illumination
and signs.
   (b)   Determination of Applicability. Upon receipt of an application for a
building permit or other municipal authorization, the Building Commissioner
shall use the standards of Section
1943.05 to determine whether the proposed action is governed by the provisions
of this Chapter. If it is determined that the action is governed by such
provisions, the Building Commissioner shall promptly transmit the application
to the Bedford Historic Preservation Board.
   (c)   Standards for Review. The Bedford Historic Preservation Board shall
evaluate the proposed action with respect to the design guidelines of Section
1943.09, as applicable.
The Board shall also consider the intent as expressed in Section
1943.01 and the definition of historic significance provided in Section
1943.07.
   (d)   Approval/Disapproval. Within thirty (30) days after acceptance of a
complete application by the Building Commissioner; the Bedford Historic
Preservation Board shall either approve, approve with modification or
disapprove the application (unless the applicant authorizes an extension in
time). However, for applications proposing the demolition or moving of
buildings or structures, the Board's action shall be limited to either approval
or "delayed approval" as prescribed in Section
1943.10.
   (e)   Approval of Nonconforming Proposals. For applications which do not
conform to the guidelines of Section
1943.09, the Bedford Historic Preservation Board may grant approval if it
determines that there is no reasonable conforming alternative to the proposal
and that a strict application of the guidelines would deny the owner a
reasonable rate of return on the subject property or account to a taking of
property without just compensation. In considering such approval, the Board
shall take into account the relative historic and architectural significance of
the subject property.
   (f)   Notifications. The Bedford Historic Preservation Board shall notify
the applicant in writing of the time and location of its meeting. Subsequent to
that meeting, the Board shall notify the applicant in writing of its
determination, stating reasons for a determination of disapproval.
   (g)   Appeal. As prescribed in Chapter
1901.
      (Ord. 7139-99. Passed 7-6-99.)
1943.09 GUIDELINES FOR REVIEW.
   In its review of applications, the Bedford Historic Preservation Board shall
follow the Standards for Rehabilitation as established by the Secretary of the
Interior and as set forth below.
   (a)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
   (b)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved.
The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property shall be avoided.
   (c)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
   (d)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
   (e)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
   (f)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and
other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing
features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence.
   (g)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historical materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
   (h)   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
   (i)   New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction shall
not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work
shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing,
size, scale and architectural features to protect the historical integrity of
the property and its environment.

1944.01 INTENT.
   It is the intent of this Chapter to maintain and enhance the distinctive
character of the H-D Historical Downtown District, hereinafter referred to as
"H-D District," by safeguarding the architectural integrity of historic
structures and sites and by preventing the intrusion of incompatible
development. Furthermore, it is an intent of this Chapter to achieve, among
others, the following related objectives:
   (a)   To foster a sense of community identification and civic pride by
preserving structures and sites which reflect periods and events in the history
of the community and its region;
   (b)   To stimulate the local economy by protecting and strengthening those
historical qualities of the district which can serve to attract customers,
clients and potential employees; and
   (c)   To protect property values and safeguard the quality of life within
the district by preventing environmental changes which diminish the district's
unique historic and architectural character.
   (d)   To promote pedestrian accessibility by grouping and clustering
buildings in a compact layout and by discouraging uses that attract large-scale
automobile and truck traffic that tend to discourage pedestrian traffic.

   (a)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
   (b)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved.
The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property shall be avoided.
   (c)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
   (d)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
   (e)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved.
   (f)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced.
Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and
other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing
features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial evidence.
   (g)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historical materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.

protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
   (i)   New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction shall
not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work
shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing,
size, scale and architectural features to protect the historical integrity of
the property and its environment.
   (j)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and
integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (k)   Signs: In addition to meeting this Code's requirements applicable to
signs generally, signs located in H-D Districts shall be compatible in color,
material, placement and character with the architectural style of properties
which reflect the district's history and are subject to the requirements of

other accessory structures shall be compatible in design with the prevailing
character of the district.
   (m)   That safe and convenient traffic movement shall be assured within the
area and in relation to adjoining streets.
   (n)   That the relation of buildings and uses in the area to each other and
their relation to buildings and uses on adjoining property shall be such that
no proposed building or use shall hinder nor discourage the appropriate
development or use of any adjoining property or be inconsistent with permitted
use of such property. The Planning Commission, Building Commissioner or
Historic Preservation Board shall disapprove any permitted building or use if
such building or use would hinder or discourage any permitted use, whether
existing or future, in the surrounding more restricted zoning district.
   (o)   The Planning Commission, Building Commissioner or Historic
Preservation Board may consider height, design, population density, traffic
pattern, setback distance between buildings, landscaping features, walls or
fences, or any other element which is related to possible impairment or
discouragement of the appropriate use of adjoining property and to the public
health, safety, convenience or comfort.

development plan within sixty (60) days of the filing of such plan. During the
sixty day time period, the plan shall be submitted to the Historic Preservation
Board for their review and approval or modification. After approval or before
the plan is modified by the Planning Commission, Building Commissioner or
Historic Preservation Board, applications may be made for building permits or
Certificates of Occupancy. Such permits or certificates shall be granted if the
applicant conforms to the approved plans and to all other requirements of this
Zoning Code. The development plan may be modified by the Planning Commission,
Building Commissioner or Historic Preservation Board acting either on petition
or on its own initiative, but cannot be so modified without notice to the
owners of all the lands included in such plan.

D District, the Bedford Historic Preservation Board is empowered to act in the
following manner.
   (a)   Determination of Significance. The Board shall determine whether the
proposed action will significantly detract from the district's historic

efficient or environmentally sensitive manner using standard lot and street
relationships. Any landowner seeking a PRD designation for a parcel of land
shall submit to Council sufficient materials to determine that such parcel
cannot be developed in a standard fashion; that the proposed project will
constitute a residential environment of a sustained desirability and stability;
that it will be in harmony with the character of the surrounding neighborhood
and insure substantially the same type of occupancy as obtains or may be
expected to obtain in such neighborhood; that it will result in intensity of
land utilization no higher, and standards of open space at least as high as
permitted or specified in this Code in the district in which the project is to
be located; and that the project will be consistent with the intent and purpose
of this Code to promote public health, safety and general welfare.

underground housing. All plans approved by the Planning Commission shall
conform to all building requirements of this Code to insure the health, safety
and welfare of both neighbors and the ultimate occupants of these structures.
Nothing in this section shall allow the Planning Commission to alter or
increase any density requirements. Whenever a question arises, the Planning
Commission may request additional detailed drawings and/or specifications to
insure the safety of the development.

required least width of each side yard for each foot by which a lot of record
at the time of enactment of this Code is narrower than the lot width specified
for the district in which the lot is located, in the case of buildings not
higher than two and one-half (2-1/2) stories, and in case the owner of record
does not own any adjoining property. However, and irrespective of the
provisions of subsection (f)(1) hereof, no side yard shall be narrower at any
point than three feet (3 ft.) on one side and seven feet (7 ft.) on the other
side except where an attached garage is provided each side yard may be three
feet (3 ft.).
   (d)   Side yards may be measured to the center line of adjoining alleys, but
in no case shall a building or structure for which a side yard is required be
erected within five feet (5 ft.) of such alley.

1955.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the City Council of Bedford, State of Ohio, does ordain as
follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Bedford has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near floodprone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Bedford as identified in Section
1955.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
City of Bedford.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Cuyahoga County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective December 3, 2010.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Bedford as required by Section
1955.04(c) Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Hall at 165 Center Road, Bedford, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including Subdivision Regulations,
Zoning or Building Codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Bedford, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 8688-10. Passed 9-20-10.)
1955.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure. A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal. A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE). The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor. See "Lowest Floor."
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill. A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones. Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined. For areas of alluvial fan flooding,
velocities also determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS). The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation. The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodway.  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (r)   Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure. Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC). A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.

vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction. Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Bedford Flood
Insurance Rate Map, December 3, 2010, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.

   (gg)   Special Flood Hazard Area. Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are floodprone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (hh)   Start of construction. The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or

before the damage occurred.
   (kk)   Substantial Improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which
have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (ll)   Variance. A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (mm)   Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 8688-10. Passed 9-20-10.)

management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section

Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1955.03(j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of City of
Bedford, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Bedford have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Bedford Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Bedford
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Bedford suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Bedford has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1955.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1955.03(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Bedford and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than a one foot increase in the base flood elevation
may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.    Section
1955.04(i)(1)B., items 1. and 3. - 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Bedford specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1955.03(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 8688-10. Passed 9-20-10.)
1955.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Bedford Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby appointed to
serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations as established by City Code.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in City Hall
at 165 Center Road, Bedford, Ohio.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1955.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within thirty days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances:
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1955.05(d)(2)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 8688-10. Passed 9-20-
10.)

constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1955.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Section
1955.06(c).
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1955.06(c).
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he shall

compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice and
order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;

of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action, which,
if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this
notice and order shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner,
occupant, or agent if a copy thereof is sent by registered or certified mail to
the person's last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a first degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of their requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned
as provided by the laws of the City of Bedford. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the City of Bedford from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The City of Bedford shall
prosecute any violation of these regulations in accordance with the penalties
stated herein. (Ord. 8688-10. Passed 9-20-10.)

adapt a residential environment into a lodging concept, limited in scope and
operation. The use is clearly of a commercial nature, but may at times, be more
in keeping with a residential environment. The purpose of this Chapter is to
provide a systematic set of requirements to ensure that such operations, if
appropriate for a residential or commercial area, shall not adversely impact
adjacent uses as a result of the commercial aspects of the structure and
property. Bed and breakfast inns/Airbnb shall be subordinate to the principal
use of a structure as a single-family dwelling. The intent of this Chapter is
not to provide an opportunity for the establishment of an intensive commercial
lodging business, which use would be considered appropriate within an intensive
commercial or planned commercial zoning district, but rather in certain
locations to provide a limited commercial use in a residential or commercial
district.
