and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with The Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter

hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the City of Heath,

   SECTION 2.  That the provisions of this ordinance, including all provisions

the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or

EDITOR'S NOTE
The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component codes,
titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for
an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially are
odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation.
Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty
provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised Code.
Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated
by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs
between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the
section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
      EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Heath Codified Ordinances was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Heath Codified Ordinances is indicated.

PREAMBLE
   We the people of Heath, Ohio, desirous of securing for our Municipality and
for ourselves and our children the advantages of self-government conferred by
the Ohio Constitution, do hereby ordain and establish the following Charter:
 
ARTICLE I
NAME, BOUNDARIES AND FORM OF GOVERNMENT
 
SECTION 1.01. NAME AND BOUNDARIES.
   The inhabitants of the Municipality of Heath, Ohio, within the corporate
limits as established at the time of the adoption of this Charter, or as
thereafter established in the manner provided by law, shall be and continue to
be a municipal corporation under the name of "The Village of Heath". When the
Municipality shall, under the Constitution and the laws of Ohio, become a city,
it shall be known as the "City of Heath." The provisions of this Charter shall
apply whether this Municipality is a village or a city. The corporation will
hereinafter be referred to as "the Municipality".
 
SECTION 1.02. FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
   The form of government provided in this Charter shall be known as the
"Mayor-Council Plan". The powers and functions of the municipal government
shall be distributed among the Municipality, its citizens, and the various
officers, bodies, boards and commissions as provided in this Charter.
 
ARTICLE II
CORPORATE POWERS
 
SECTION 2.01. POWERS GRANTED.
   The Municipality shall have all the powers, general or special,
governmental, or proprietary, that may now or hereafter lawfully be possessed
or exercised by municipal corporations under the Constitution and general laws
of the State of Ohio, either expressly or by implication, as fully and
completely as if they were specifically enumerated in this Charter.
(Amended 11-8-22.)
 
SECTION 2.02. MANNER OF EXERCISE OF POWERS.
   All such powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed in this Charter,
or if not prescribed herein, in such manner as shall be provided by ordinance
or resolution of the Council, and when not prescribed in this Charter or
provided by ordinance or resolution of Council, then such powers shall be
exercised in the manner provided by the general laws of the State of Ohio until
the Council shall provide a different manner of exercise such powers.
(Amended 11-8-22.)
 
SECTION 2.03. CONSTRUCTION.
   The powers of the Municipality under this Charter shall be construed
liberally in favor of the Municipality, and the specific mention of particular
powers in the Charter shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general
power stated in this article. In addition to the powers specifically mentioned
or implied in this Charter, the Municipality has every other power that the
Constitution and general laws of Ohio would allow this Charter to enumerate.
Nothing contained in this Charter limits the power of the Council to enact any
ordinance or resolution that does not conflict with the Constitution or general
laws of Ohio or with express provisions of this Charter. (Amended 11-8-22.)
 
 
ARTICLE III
COUNCIL
 
SECTION 3.01. NUMBER, TERM AND SALARY.
   The legislative powers of the Municipality, except as otherwise provided by
this Charter and by the Constitution of the State of Ohio, shall be vested in a
Council of seven members. Four of such members shall be elected from the
Municipality at large and three of such members shall be elected from wards as
established in this Charter. All members of Council shall be elected for
overlapping terms of four years; except, that at the first election held under
the provisions of this Charter at the November 1965 election the two members of
Council holding unexpired terms under the village statutory form of government
shall continue in office until January 1, 1968, as at large Council members
under this Charter, two at large Council members shall be elected for two
terms; and the three ward Council members shall be elected for four year terms.
At the regular municipal election to be held in November 1967 and each four
years thereafter four at large Council members shall be elected for four year
terms. At the regular municipal election to be held in November 1969 and each
four years thereafter three ward Council members shall be elected for four year
terms. Members of Council shall take office January 2 of the year following
their election and shall serve until the expiration of their term of office and
until their successors are elected and qualified. If for any reason a member of
Council shall fail to qualify for office within 45 days after Jan. 2 of the
year following his election a vacancy shall be deemed to exist and such vacancy
shall be filled in the manner provided in Section
3.13 of this Charter. The salary of Council members for the terms beginning
January 2, 1966, shall be that amount as shall have been fixed by Council in
accordance with Section 731.13 of the Revised Code of Ohio.
 
SECTION 3.02. QUALIFICATIONS.
   All members of the Council shall have been residents of the Municipality for
at least one continuous year immediately prior to the time of filing for
office, shall be qualified electors of the Municipality, and shall continue to
be qualified electors thereof throughout their respective terms of office. In
addition to the qualifications provided hereinabove, members of Council elected
from wards shall be electors of the ward from which they seek election at the
time of the filing of declarations of candidacy, and during their term of
office. A member of Council shall not hold any other public office; except as
otherwise provided in this Charter or by ordinance enacted thereunder, or that
of notary public or member of the State militia or national guard, or a reserve
component of the United States Armed Forces or any branch thereof, or that of a
member of the County central committee of the political party of which he is a
member, or that of a delegate to a State or national political party convention
of the political party of which he is a member.
   Any member of Council who shall cease to possess or who violates any of the
qualifications herein provided shall forfeit his office, but failure to
maintain such qualifications shall not render void or ineffective any action of
Council in which such member has participated.
 
SECTION 3.03. DIVISION OF MUNICIPALITY INTO WARDS.
   For purposes of electing ward Council members the Municipality is hereby
divided into three (3) wards. Council shall, by ordinance, establish ward
boundaries following each decennial census or more frequently as may be deemed
necessary in conformance with the procedure set forth in the Ohio Revised Code.
(Amended 11-2-82)
 
SECTION 3.04. ORGANIZATION OF COUNCIL.
   On the second day of January in 1966 and each even numbered year thereafter
the Council shall meet in the Council chamber for the purpose of organization.
The Council shall adopt its own rules, regulations and bylaws except as
otherwise provided in this Charter.
 
SECTION 3.05. PRESIDENT OF COUNCIL.
   At the first meeting of the Council in the year 1966 and at the first
meeting of Council in each even numbered year thereafter, the Council shall
elect from its own membership a President of Council, who shall serve until a
successor is elected by the Council as provided hereinabove. The President of
Council shall preside at all regular and special meetings of the Council and
shall perform such other duties as provided by this Charter or by ordinance,
resolution, or motion passed by the Council. While presiding over special or
regular meetings of the Council the President of Council may vote upon all
matters coming before the Council, but in no event shall the President of
Council, in his dual capacity as Council member and presiding officer of
Council, cast more than one vote on any action.
   In the event that the office of Mayor shall become vacant the President of
Council shall become Mayor and shall serve for the unexpired term of the Mayor.
During the temporary absence or disability of the Mayor the President of
Council shall become Acting Mayor and shall exercise all the powers, duties and
functions of the Mayor. During the period the President of Council is Acting
Mayor he may receive such compensation in addition to his salary as President
of Council as determined by the Council. While the President of Council is
Acting Mayor he shall not preside at Council meetings nor shall he vote upon
any matter before the Council.
 
SECTION 3.06. PRESIDENT PRO TEM OF COUNCIL.
   At the first meeting of the Council in the year 1966 and at the first
meeting of Council in each even numbered year thereafter, the Council shall
elect from its own membership a President Pro Tem, who shall serve until a
successor is elected from the Council as provided hereinabove. The President
Pro Tem shall act as the presiding officer of the Council in the absence or
disability of the President of Council and shall exercise all the powers and
duties granted the President of Council by this Charter during the absence or
disability of the President of Council. While presiding over special or regular
meetings of the Council the President Pro Tem may vote upon all matters coming
before the Council, but in no event shall the President Pro Tem, in his dual
capacity as Council member and presiding officer of Council cast more than one
vote on any action. In the event that the office of President of Council shall
become vacant the President Pro Tem shall become President of Council for the
unexpired term, and the Council shall elect a successor from among the
membership of the Council to the office of President Pro Tem for that unexpired
term.
 
SECTION 3.07.  CLERK OF COUNCIL.
   The Clerk of Council shall be appointed by the Council no later than the
first meeting in January in each even numbered year, and shall serve at its
pleasure. The Clerk of Council shall keep an accurate and complete journal of
the proceedings of Council and perform such other duties as this Charter or the
Council may require. The Clerk of Council may be a person having employment or
appointment with the Municipality. The Council may employ such other employees
as it deems necessary for the proper discharge of its duties.
(Amended 11-3-70.)
 
SECTION 3.08. POWERS OF COUNCIL.
   All legislative power of the Municipality shall be vested in the Council,
except as otherwise provided by this Charter and the Constitution of the State
of Ohio. Without limitation of the foregoing the Council shall have and possess
the following powers:
   (a)   The power to levy taxes and incur debt subject to the limitations
imposed thereon by this Charter.
   (b)   The power to adopt and to provide for the enforcement of local police,
sanitary and other similar regulations as are not in conflict with general
laws.

government granted to the Municipality by the Constitution of the State of Ohio
in a manner not inconsistent with this Charter or the Constitution of the State
of Ohio.

benefits as deemed proper by the Council.
   (e)   The power to require such bonds as in the opinion of the Council are

published as provided by this Charter. By ordinance adopted by a two-thirds
vote of all members elected to the Council, the Council may waive bidding and
advertising as required by this Charter if the Council determines that an item

could be lost due to time constraints, or that a waiver of the competitive
bidding requirement is in the best interest of the Municipality.

authorized by this Charter as the amount under which competitive bidding need
not be undertaken, shall first be authorized by ordinance, but need not be

      (5)   No contract or order made by the contracting officer of the
Municipality shall be effective until the Auditor or his duly authorized
representative, shall certify, and attach such certificate to said contract or
order, that the amount required to meet the contract or order has been lawfully
appropriated for such purpose and is in the treasury or in process of
collection to the credit of an appropriate fund free from previous
encumbrances. Every contract or order made without such a certificate shall be
void and no warrant shall be issued in payment thereof, unless the Council

payment thereof. The Auditor shall not arbitrarily withhold such certificate.

special meeting shall be given each absentee in the manner hereinbefore

available for inspection at the office of the Clerk of Council, Municipal
Building, Heath, Ohio. A failure to publish, ommission, delay or error in said
publication on the part of the newspaper, its officers, employees or agents,
shall not cause such ordinance or resolution to be declared invalid, or
otherwise affect the validity of such ordinance or resolution, and in such
events the Clerk of Council may authorize publication at a later date. After
the publication of the title of each ordinance or resolution as hereinabove
provided the Clerk of Council shall affix the following certification to the

a date not less than sixty days after the date of the passage of the resolution
to refer, and the Clerk of Council shall cause notice of the special election
to be published on the same day of each week for two consecutive weeks in a

the ballot: "shall an (ordinance or resolution) providing: (the wording
contained in the title of the proposed ordinance or resolution shall be
inserted here) be adopted?"; with the provision of the ballot for voting
affirmatively or negatively. In the event a majority of those voting on the
issue shall be in the affirmative the ordinance or resolution shall go into
immediate effect, without the need for further publication.
 
SECTION 15.04. RECALL.
   The electors shall have the power to remove from office by a recall election
the Mayor, Auditor and any Councilman of the Municipality in the manner herein
provided. If the Mayor, Auditor, or any Councilman shall have served six (6)
months of his term, a petition demanding his removal may be filed with the
Clerk of Council, who shall note thereon the name and address of the person
filing the petition and the date of such filing, and deliver to such person a
receipt therefor and attach a copy thereof to said petition. Such petition may
be circulated in separate parts, but the separate parts shall be bound together
and filed as one instrument. Each part shall contain the name and office of the
person whose removal is sought and a statement in not more than two hundred
(200) words of the grounds for the removal. Such petition shall be signed by at
least that number of electors which equals twenty-five percent (25%) in number
of the electors voting at the last preceding regular municipal election. Within
twenty (20) days after the day on which such petition shall have been filed,
the Clerk of Council shall determine whether or not it meets the requirements
hereof. If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition insufficient, he shall
promptly certify the particulars in which the petition is defective, deliver a
copy of his certificate to the person who filed the petition, and make a record
of such delivery. Such person shall be allowed a period of ten (10) days after
the day on which such delivery was made in which to make the petition
sufficient. If the Clerk of Council shall find the petition sufficient, he
shall promptly so certify to Council, shall deliver a copy of such certificate
to the Mayor, Auditor, or the Councilman whose removal is sought, and shall
make a record of such delivery. If such person shall not resign within five (5)
days after the day on which such delivery shall have been made, Council shall

shall cause notice of such recall election to be published on the same day of
each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper determined by the Council to

shall be placed upon the ballot: "Shall (naming the person whose removal is
sought) be allowed to continue as (naming the position held)?", with the
provision on the ballot for voting affirmatively or negatively, and in the
event a majority of the vote is negative such person shall be considered as
removed, his office shall be deemed vacant, and such vacancy shall be filled as
provided in this Charter. The person removed at such recall election shall not
be eligible for appointment to the vacancy created thereby. If the person is
not removed at such recall election, no further recall petitions shall be filed
against him for a period of one (1) year following such election. A removal by
recall election shall not bar the person so removed from becoming a candidate
for office in future elections. In the event that a recall election is ordered,
as provided by this section, for a ward Council member only the duly qualified
electors of the ward which said Council member represents shall be entitled to
vote upon the issue of recall.

after a day named, no part of that day shall be included.
         (ORC 1.15)
      (5)   In all cases where the law shall require any act to be done in a
reasonable time or reasonable notice to be given, such reasonable time or
notice shall mean such time only as may be necessary for the prompt performance
of such duty or compliance with such notice.
   (d)   Authority. When the law requires an act to be done which may by law as
well be done by an agent as by the principal, such requirement shall be
construed to include all such acts when done by an authorized agent.
   (e)   Joint Authority. All words purporting to give joint authority to three
or more municipal officers or other persons shall be construed as giving such
authority to a majority of such officers or other persons, unless it shall be
otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority or inconsistent
with State statute or Charter provisions.
   (f)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which
shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when the
subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

105.01 POWER TO APPROPRIATE GENERALLY.
   Property may be appropriated by the City for any public or municipal
purpose, and subject only to the limitations imposed by the Constitution of
Ohio, such appropriation shall be made as provided in this chapter. By such
appropriation the City may acquire a fee simple title or any less estate,
easement or use as determined to be necessary by Council.
(Ord. 12-73. Passed 2-20-73.)
105.02 RESOLUTION OF INTENT.
   (a)   Whenever it is deemed necessary by Council to appropriate private
property for a public purpose, Council shall pass a resolution declaring the
intention of appropriating the property for a public purpose, defining the
purpose of the appropriation, and setting forth a pertinent description of the
land and the estate or interest therein desired to be appropriated.
   (b)   Upon the passage of a resolution under declaring an itent to
appropriate property, the Law Director shall cause written notice to be given
to the owner of, person in possession of, or person having an interest of
record in every piece of property sought to be appropriated, or to his
authorized agent. Such notice shall be served by a person designated for the
purpose, and return made in the manner provided by State general law for the
service and return of summons in civil actions. If such owner or agent cannot
be found, notice shall be given by publication once a week for three
consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.
(Ord. 12-73. Passed 2-20-73.)
105.03 ORDINANCE TO APPROPRIATE; DETERMINATION OF VALUE.
   After service of notice of the resolution of intent to appropriate, Council
may pass an ordinance directing the appropriation to proceed. Except in
appropriation actions for the purpose of making or repairing roads, or other
public exigencies under Section 19, Article I, Ohio Constitution, which shall
be governed by this Code, if possession of the property is necessary prior to
the assessment of compensation by a jury, Council shall in such ordinance
declare the City's intention and necessity to obtain immediate possession of
the property appropriated and shall secure the payment of the compensation that
might be assessed by a jury by causing the deposit with the Court of Common
Pleas of Licking County, as security, of a sum of money not less than the
appraised value of the property, as determined by an independent, qualified
appraiser retained by the City, plus sixty percent (60%) of such appraised
value. That portion of the security deposit designated as the appraised value
may be withhdrawn by the owner prior to the final verdict. Upon the deposit of
such security with such court, the City may take possession of and enter upon
such property, including the buildings and structures thereon, for the purposes
for which the property was appropriated, and, if buildings or structures are
located partly upon the land appropriated and partly upon the adjoining land,
so that such buildings or structures cannot be divided upon the line between
such lands without manifest injury thereto, the City may enter upon such
adjoining land upon which any part of the buildings or structures are located
for the purpose of removing such buildings or structures.
(Ord. 12-73. Passed 2-20-73.)
105.04 PROCEDURE FOR STRUCTURES TAKEN.
   If buildings or structures are located upon land appropriated, or located
partly upon the land appropriated and partly upon adjoining land so that such
buildings or structures cannot be divided upon the line between such lands
without manifest injury thereto, and such buildings or structures are removed
before the owner accepts that portion of any deposit representing the appraised
value of the property or the jury has fixed the value of the same, the Law
Director, upon notification from the Service Director that such buildings or
structures are to be removed, shall cause an appraisal to be made by three
persons, one to be appointed by the owner, one by the Law Director and one by
the County Auditor. Such appraisal may be used as evidence by either the City
or the owner in the trial of the case, but neither the City, nor the owner
shall be found by such appraisal. The making of such appraisal may be waived in
writing by the owner. The Service Director shall cause pictures to be taken of
all sides of such building or structure and shall compile a complete
description of such structure for the purpose of perpetuating evidence of the
nature of such structure which may be presented as evidence in the case by
either the City or the owner and to which the owner shall have complete access.
(Ord. 12-73. Passed 2-20-73.)
105.05 COURT OF COMMON PLEAS.
   Upon passage of an appropriation ordinance as provided in Section
105.03, the Law Director shall file a complaint with the Court of Common Pleas
of Licking County, which complaint shall describe each parcel of land or
contiguous parcels in a single common ownership, or interest or right therein
sought to be appropriated, such as will permit ready identification of the land
involved; shall contain a statement of the purpose of the appropriation; shall
contain a statement of the estate or interest sought to be appropriated; shall
contain the names and addresses of the owners, so far as they can be
ascertained; shall contain a statement that the City and an owner have been
unable to agree; shall contain a copy of the ordinance of appropriation, or
have a copy attached thereto as an exhibit and incorporated into such
complaint; shall contain a prayer for the appropriation; and, if a
determination of the appraised value has been made, the complaint shall contain
a statement of the appraised value of the property, which appraised value may
include damage, if any, to the residue and in addition, where immediate
possession is to be taken of the property, a statement of the amount of the
additional percentage deposit, and such amount or amounts shall be deposited
with the court to serve either as the value of the property appropriated, and
damage, if any, to the residue, or as a security deposit. If no answer is filed
by an owner on or before the third Saturday after the return day of the summons
or service by publication as provided by State general law, the owners of the
property appropriated will be deemed to have accepted that portion of the
amount deposited equal to or represented by the appraised value, in full
compensation for the taking and damages, if any, to the residue, and the title
of the property appropriated shall vest in the City for the purposes for which
such property was appropriated. All subsequent proceedings with regard thereto
shall be in the manner provided by State general law for the appropriation of
property by municipal corporations in this State.

   Council hereby establishes the following rules and order of business as the
permanent rules for the government of Council:
Rule 1. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of Council shall be held on the

shall contain a statement of the business for the transaction of which such
special meeting may be called.
Rule 3. Duties of President. The President of Council or, in his absence, the
President pro tem, shall take the chair at the hour to which Council shall have

ordered by Council. In the absence of the President and President pro tem, the
Clerk shall call Council to order and call the roll. If the quorum shall then
be present, Council shall appoint one of its members President pro tem for that

He may, in common with any member, call any member to order who violates any of
the rules, and shall, when in the chair, decide all questions of order subject
to an appeal of Council, on the demand of two members, on which appeal there
shall be no debate, but the member making the appeal may briefly state his
reasons for the same. All questions are to be stated and put by the chair, who
shall declare all votes, but in doubtful cases may direct, or any member may
call for a division, which shall be taken by a yea and nay vote. (Ord. 43-68.
Passed 5-6-68.)

Rule 9. Variation from Order of Business. After reading and disposing of the
journal, it shall be the duty of the President to proceed with the order of
business adopted in Rule 8. The President may, however, at any time, permit a
member to introduce an ordinance, resolution, motion or order out of the
regular order for the same, if there is no objection on the part of any member.
Rule 10. Reports. Any subject matter having been referred to any committee of
Council shall be reported upon, in writing, by such committee or officer, and
shall be signed by such committee or officer. Such written report shall
recommend the adoption or passage of the matter upon which the report is based,
or its refusal as the committee may decide. The same shall be attached to the
matter reported upon, and shall be read by the Clerk in the proper order of
business.
Rule 11. Who Entitled to Floor. In all cases, the member who shall first rise
and address the chair shall speak first, but when two or more members shall
rise at once, the President shall name the member who is first to speak. No
member shall be allowed to speak except from his own desk. No member shall
speak more than twice on the same subject, nor longer than five minutes without
leave, and no member shall speak more than once on the same motion until every
member desiring to speak on that motion shall have had an opportunity to do so.
Any member, while discussing a question, may read from books, papers or
documents any matter pertinent to the subject under consideration, without
asking leave.
Rule 12. Procedure. When a motion is made and seconded, it shall be stated by
the President before any debate shall be in order. Every such motion and all
amendments thereto, if any, may be withdrawn by the movers thereof at any time
before decision, if a majority of the members then present shall agree thereto.
Rule 13. Call for Division. Any member may call for a division of the question,
or the President may direct the same. The same, in either case, shall be
divided if it comprehends questions so distinct that one being taken away, the
other will stand an entire question for decision.
Rule 14. Motion or Proposition to be in Writing. When required by any member,
every motion or proposition shall be reduced to writing before action is taken
thereon.
Rule 15. Procedure on Reference. When a motion is made for reference of any
subject to a standing committee, and it is moved to substitute therefor a
select committee, the question of reference to a standing committee shall be
first put.
Rule 16. Motion to Adjourn. A motion to adjourn shall always be in order,
unless Council is engaged in voting, but being decided in the negative shall
not again be entertained until some motion, call or order takes place.
Rule 17. Precedence. When a question or proposition is before Council or under
debate, no motion shall be received except the following:
      (a)   To adjourn.
      (b)   To lay on the table.
      (c)   The previous question.
      (d)   To postpone to a day certain.
      (e)   To amend.
      (f)   To commit.
      (g)   To postpone definitely.
Rule 18. Motion to Take from Table. A motion to take from the table shall be in
order when that order of business is being transacted in which such matter to
be taken up was laid upon the table, and such motion shall be decided without
debate; provided that the mover may be permitted to briefly state his reason
for the motion.
Rule 19. Reconsideration. Any member who voted on the prevailing side may move
a reconsideration of any action of Council, provided that the motion is made
not later than the next regular meeting after such action was taken. A motion
to reconsider shall be in order any time, except when a motion on some other
subject is pending. A motion to reconsider being laid upon the table may be
taken up and acted upon at any time when Council is engaged in transacting
miscellaneous business. No motion to reconsider shall be made more than once on
any matter or subject, and the same number of votes shall be required to pass
or adopt the same. (Ord. 2-98. Passed 1-5-98.)
Rule 20. Previous Question. When the previous question shall be moved and
seconded, it shall be put in these words: "Shall the main question now be put?"
Until decided, it shall preclude all further debate and all amendments and
motions, except one motion to adjourn and one motion to lay on the table, but
shall not preclude pending amendments from being put in their order before the
main question. If a call for previous question is not sustained, the subject
under consideration shall not thereby be postponed, but the business shall
proceed as if no such call had been made.
Rule 21. When Yeas and Nays to be Taken. When demanded by any member, and
seconded, the yeas and nays shall be taken on the adoption of any resolution or
any question or proposition submitted to Council. In taking the yeas and nays,
the Clerk shall first have selected, from a receptacle, a cube or ball
containing a number between one and seven, and that cube or ball shall indicate
the Councilman who shall be first to vote on all roll call votes for the
particular meeting of Council, with all other Councilmen voting after the one
selected in alphabetical order, and the President shall announce the result of
such vote. The Clerk may be required to read the vote taken upon the demand of
any member. (Ord. 113-2004. Passed 1-3-05.)
Rule 22. Introduction of Ordinances. Ordinances shall be introduced by members
of Council.
Rule 23. Referral. After an ordinance or resolution has been once referred to a
standing or special committee and a report has been read the second time and
put on its passage, it shall not again be referred, except under instructions
from Council, which shall embody substantially the amendment or amendments
proposed.
Rule 24. Passage of Ordinances and Resolutions. The action of Council shall be
by ordinance, resolution or motion, and on the passage of every ordinance,
resolution or motion, the vote shall be taken by "yeas" or "nays" and entered
in the journal, provided, however, that this shall not apply to the ordering of
an election or direction by Council to any board or officer to furnish Council
with information as to the affairs of any department or office. However,
communications may be received and filed viva voce, and a Councilman's absence
from a meeting may be excused viva voce.
No ordinance shall be passed by Council without the concurrence of a majority
of all members elected thereto. Ordinances for second reading shall not be
considered or acted on in connection with other matters, and a separate roll
call and vote shall be had on the passage of each and every ordinance.
Rule 25. Appropriations and Expenditures. Resolutions that do not involve the
expenditure of money may be acted upon at once, if no objection is raised. All
other resolutions shall be referred to the proper committee. No contract,
agreement or other object involving the expenditure of money shall be entered
into, nor shall any ordinance, resolution or order for the appropriation or
expenditure of money be passed by Council unless the City Auditor shall have
first certified that the money required for the contract, agreement or other
obligation, or to pay the appropriation or expenditure, is in the treasury to
the credit of the fund from which it is to be drawn, and not appropriated for
any other purpose.
Rule 26. Appeal from Decision of Chair. An appeal to Council from the decision
of the Chair may be taken by any member, if duly seconded, and the question
shall be, "Shall the decision of the Chair be sustained?"
Rule 27. Motions not Debatable. The following motions are not debatable:
      (a)   To adjourn.
      (b)   To lay on the table.
      (c)   To take from the table.
      (d)   For the previous question.
      (e)   Question to order.
Rule 28. Call to Order. If any member, in speaking or otherwise, shall violate
any rule of Council, the President shall, or any member may, call him to order;
if such member shall be called to order while speaking, he shall immediately
take his seat. The question of order shall be decided without debate, and if
the decision shall be in favor of the member called to order while speaking, he
shall be at liberty to proceed with his speech without leave of Council.
Rule 29. Taking Matter from Committees. If any matter is referred to any
standing or special committee of Council, and the same is not reported upon by
such committee at the next regular meeting of Council, Council may, by a
majority vote thereof, take such matter so referred from such committee and act
upon such matter without report, at the meeting following the failure to
report, unless, upon proper excuse, an extension of time is granted such
committee.

         (Ord. 87-01. Passed 11-19-01.)

allocated to the City. If the Tax Commissioner finds net profits are not
properly allocated to the City by reason of transactions with stockholders or
with other corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates
or some other method, he may require the filing of a consolidated return or
adjust such transactions so as to produce a fair and proper allocation of net
profits to the City.

salaries, commissions or other compensation, without reimbursement from his

date for the current year declaration is not included under the extension
request.

taxpayer, or where an income tax, creditable against the City tax has been paid
to another City, pursuant to the provisions of Section

for all amounts owed by him under the ordinance.
      (5)   All returns postmarked by the United States Postal Service on the

business who engage persons, either on a commission basis, or as independent
contractors, and are not subject to withholding shall indicate the total amount
of earnings, payments, commissions and bonuses to such as are residents of the
City or who do business in the City; providing the same information as is
required on Federal Form 1099.
   (g)   All contractors, subcontractors or any other person as defined herein,

181.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer, unless otherwise prohibited by law, within or doing
business within the City who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage,
commissions or other compensation basis shall deduct at the time of the payment
of such salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation, the tax of one a
one-half percent (1 ½%) of the gross salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation due by such employer to each such employee and shall, on or before
the last day specified below during the effective period of this chapter, make
a return and pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes so deducted during
the preceding calendar month or quarter. Such return shall be on a form or
forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Tax Commissioner.
      (1)   Monthly payments of taxes withheld and/or required to be withheld
shall be made by an employer if the taxes withheld in the prior calendar year
were more than one thousand, one hundred ninety- nine dollars ($1,199.00) or if
the taxes withheld during any month for the preceding quarter exceeded one
hundred dollars ($100.00). Such payments shall be made to the City on or before
the last day of the month following the month during which the undeposited
taxes were withheld.
      (2)   All employers not required to make monthly payments of taxes
withheld under subsection (a)(1) hereof, shall make quarterly payments no later
than the last day of the month following the end of each quarter (April, July,
October, and January) of each year.
      (3)   Effective January 1, 2001, a nonresident employer, agent of such
employer, or other payer that is not situated in the City and is not currently
required to withhold City income tax, shall not be required to withhold City
tax from the taxable income of an individual unless the total amount of tax
required to be deducted and withheld for the City on account of all of the
employer’s employees or all of the other payer’s payees exceeds one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) for a calendar year.
   When the collective tax liability exceeds one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00), the employer is required to begin withholding the appropriate City
tax on behalf of all the employees performing work or rendering services in the
City for the remainder of that calendar year and for subsequent years, even if
the liability in subsequent years does not exceed one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00). However, if the tax liability for each of three (3) consecutive
years does not exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00), the City shall not
require the employer, agent or other payer to deduct and withhold City tax in
any year following the last of those consecutive years unless the amount
required to be deducted and withheld in any such following year exceeds one
hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
   (b)   Each employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a trustee for the
benefit of the City and any such tax collected by such employer from his
employees shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in
the hands of such employer. Each employer shall be liable for the payment of
the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact,
has been withheld.
   (c)   It shall be the responsibility, jointly and severally, for the
president and treasurer or senior local administrative agent of each
corporation, required to withheld the tax from the wages of its employees,
under this section, to see that all such taxes are paid to the City in
accordance with the provisions of this section. In the event taxes withheld by
a corporation from the salaries of its employees are not paid to the City in
accordance with the provisions of this section, the president and treasurer or
senior local administrative agent of such corporation shall be criminally
liable.
   (d)   Each employer, on or before the last day of February each year, unless
written request for thirty (30) days extension is made to and granted by the
Tax Commissioner or his agent, following any calendar year in which such
deductions have been made, or should have been made, shall file a withholding
information return, on a form prescribed by or acceptable to the Tax
Commissioner, setting forth the names, social security numbers and addresses of
all employees, the gross amount of compensation paid during the year, and the
amount of tax withheld from the listed employees and such other information as
may be required by the Tax Commissioner.
 
   (e)   Provided, however, that no person shall be required to withhold the
tax on the wages or other compensation paid domestic servants employed
exclusively in or about such person’s residence. (Ord. 87-01. Passed 11-19-01.)
181.05 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject
to Section
181.04, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income, or the estimated
profit or loss from such business activity, together with the estimated tax due
thereon, if any, and if the amount can be reasonably expected to exceed one
hundred dollars ($100.00).
   (b)   (1)    Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15
(effective 1/1/03) of each year during the life of this chapter, or within four
months of the date the taxpayer first becomes subject to the provisions of this
section.
         (Ord. 87-01. Passed 11-19-01.)
      (2)   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration by the fifteen (15th) day of the fourth month after the start of
each fiscal year or period.
(Ord. 94-2011. Passed 12-19-11.)
   (c)   (1)    Such declaration shall be filed upon a form prescribed by or
acceptable to the Tax Commissioner. Credit shall be taken in such declaration
for the City tax to be withheld from any portion of such income and for income
taxes to be paid to another taxing city for which credit is allowed against the
Heath City tax. (Ord. 87-01. Passed 11-19-01.)
      (2)   A declaration of estimated tax paid to the City shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated tax; less
credit for tax withheld or paid to another city and at least a similar amount
shall be paid on or before the last day of the seventh, tenth, and thirteenth
month after the beginning of the tax year for individual taxpayers. For
taxpayers who are not individuals, the remaining payments of at least a similar
amount shall be paid on or before the fifteenth of the sixth, ninth and twelfth
months after the beginning of the taxable calendar year or taxable fiscal year,
if applicable. (Ord. 98-2011. Passed 1-3-12.)
      (3)   A declaration may be amended at any time, provided, however, that
in the case an amended declaration is filed, the unpaid balance shown due
thereon shall be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment
dates.
   (d)   An amended declaration must be filed on or before December 31, of any
year, or in the case of a taxpayer on a fiscal year accounting basis, on or
before the dates fixed by the Tax Commissioner, if it appears that the original
declaration made for such year underestimated the taxpayer’s income by ten
percent (10%) or more. At such time a payment which, together with prior
payment, is sufficient to pay the taxpayer’ entire estimated liability, shall
be made. If, upon the filing of the return it appears that the taxpayer did not
pay ninety percent (90%) of his tax liability, as shown on such return, on or
before December 31, or the date fixed by the Tax Commissioner, whichever is
applicable, he shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions.
(Ord. 87-01. Passed 11-19-01.)
181.06 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter and remaining unpaid after they
become due shall bear interest, in addition to the amount of the unpaid tax, at
the rate of one and one-half percent (1 ½%) per month or fraction thereof.
 
   (b)   In addition to interest as provided in subsection (a) above, penalties
based on unpaid tax from taxpayers, monies withheld or required to be withheld
by employers under the provisions of this chapter, and for failure to file
returns or information filings as required under the provisions of this
chapter, are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)   For failure to pay taxes due, other than taxes withheld, ten
percent (10%) of the total tax due.
      (2)   For failure to remit taxes withheld or required to be withheld,
five percent (5%) per month up to a maximum of one hundred percent (100%) of
the total tax due.
      (3)   For failure to file a declaration of estimated tax, five dollars
($5.00) per quarter of any reporting year.
      (4)   For failure to file a yearly final return, twenty-five dollars
($25.00).
      (5)   For failure to file employer’s reconciliation of income tax
withheld, twenty- five dollars ($25.00).
   (c)   A penalty shall not be assessed on an additional tax assessment made
by the Tax Commissioner when a return has been filed in good faith and the tax
paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Tax Commissioner; and provided
further, that, in the absence of fraud, neither penalty or interest shall be
assessed on any additional tax assessment resulting from a Federal audit,
providing an amended return is filed and the additional tax is paid within
three months after final determination of the Federal tax liability.
 
   (d)   The Tax Commissioner may abate penalties and interest imposed by this
section, and may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations governing the
abatement of penalties and interest. Such abatement is authorized whether in
part or in full.
(Ord. 87-01. Passed 11-19-01.)
181.07 COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES; REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENT.
   (a)   All Taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties thereon, by suit the same as other amounts owed in
other matters are recoverable. No additional assessment shall be made after
three years from the time of payment of any tax due hereunder; provided,
however, there shall be no period of limitation on an additional assessment in
a case of a return that omits gross income in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) of that required to be reported, or in the case of filing a false or
fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, or in the case of failure to
file a return. Prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the
commission of the offense. In those cases in which the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue and the taxpayer have executed a waiver of the Federal statute of
limitations the period within which an additional assessment may be made by the
Tax Commissioner shall be extended one year from the time of the final
determination of the Federal tax liability.
 
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made within three years from the date on which such payment was made or the
return was due, or within three months after final determination of the Federal
tax liability, whichever is later.
(Ord. 87-01. Passed 11-19-01.)
181.08 ALLOCATION OF FUNDS.
   The revenues collected under the provisions of this chapter are hereby
allocated to the General Fund and Capital Improvements Fund. Each year Council

necessary for current operating expenses.
(Ord. 87-01. Passed 11-19-01.)
181.09 CREDITS FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER CITY.
   (a)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the City and who receives
salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation or net profits from sales
made, work done, or services performed or rendered outside of the City, if it
is established with supporting documentation that said income is subject to
municipal income tax in another City, or if it can be demonstrated that said
taxpayer has paid a municipal income tax based on income taxable under this
chapter, shall be allowed a credit for the amount so paid to such other City.
The credit shall not exceed 1.25% of the income subject to the tax of such
other municipality. The credit shall not be allowed for taxes erroneously paid
to another municipality. If it is established that said tax was withheld or
paid to a municipality, but that the taxpayer had no legal obligation to pay
said tax, no credit for said tax shall be permitted.
   (b)   A resident of the City who has sustained a net loss arising from a
business activity in another municipality shall be subject to the same
reduction. Eighty-three percent (83%) of said loss can be used to offset other

county, state or federal taxing authority.
   (d)   A partial year resident must pro-rate credit for taxes owed and paid

dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the

      (6)   "Worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary
worksite in this state at which the employer provides services for more than
twenty days during the calendar year. "Worksite location" does not include the
home of an employee.
      (7)   "Principal place of work" means the fixed location to which an
employee is required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary
basis. If the employee is not required to report for employment duties on a
regular and ordinary basis to a fixed location, "principal place of work" means
the worksite location in this state to which the employee is required to report
for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis. If the employee is not
required to report for employment duties on a regular and ordinary basis to a
fixed location or worksite location, "principal place of work" means the
location in this state at which the employee spends the greatest number of days
in a calendar year performing services for or on behalf of the employee's
employer.
If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)    Subject to divisions (C), (E), (F), and (G) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in the City if the
employee performed such services in the City on twenty or fewer days in a
calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the City.
         (b)   The employee performed services at one or more presumed worksite
locations in the City. For the purposes of this division, "presumed worksite
location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in this state
at which the employer provides services that can reasonably be expected by the
employer to last more than twenty days in a calendar year. Services can
"reasonably be expected by the employer to last more than twenty days" if
either of the following applies at the time the services commence:
            (i)   The nature of the services are such that it will require more
than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the City and has requested that
the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided in
Section
183.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the City.
      (2)    For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the City only if
the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf of the
employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on that day. For
the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in the City,
the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)(1) of
this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying
wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such
qualifying wages to the City.
   (D)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City exceeds the twenty-day threshold described in
division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and remit tax to
the City for any subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer
pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the
City.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City under
division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the City for the
first twenty days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the employee
for personal services performed in the City.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
183.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, the Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
183.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in the City, an employer is not required to withhold municipal
income tax on the qualifying wages of such a person if the person performs
those services on twelve or fewer days in a calendar year, unless the principal
place of work of the employer is located in another municipal corporation in
this state that imposes a tax applying to compensation paid to the person for
services performed on those days and the person is not liable to that other
municipal corporation for tax on the compensation paid for such services. For
the purposes of this division, a petroleum refinery is a facility with a
standard industrial classification code facility classification of 2911,
petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator shall

the name, address, and social security number of the person from whose winnings
amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such deduction and
withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of the winnings

withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the

information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.

person was omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that
information shall be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding

shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information return issued
under this division. The Tax Administrator may require that such copies be
transmitted electronically.

terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent

are due.

personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator may impose the following applicable penalty:

amount is deducted and withheld.
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and

INDIVIDUALS.
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
City is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment.
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net

Section
183.03(23).
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section

in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the

period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever

following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
City;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in

183.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
Taxpayers may elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of calculating
net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation in which
the property is located.

commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of the City shall report the

individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
183.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
183.03 of this Chapter, the taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from
taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City. In no
case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned
to the City any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.

applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election, The
taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this section, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year, A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location,
      After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business, The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation. Nothing in this
section prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under this section
after properly revoking a prior election.
   (K)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in Section
183.062(A), all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the election
described in division (B) of this section:
      (1)    For the purpose of Section
183.062(A)(1) of this chapter, the average original cost of any tangible
personal property used by a qualifying remote employee or owner at that
individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that
individual's qualifying reporting location.
      (2)    For the purpose of Section
183.062(A)(2) of this chapter, any wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the taxable period to a qualifying remote employee or owner for services
performed at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be sitused
to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
      (3)    For the purpose of Section
183.062(A)(3) of this chapter, and notwithstanding Section
183.062(O) of this chapter of this section, any gross receipts of the business
or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
   (L)    Nothing in this section prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a tax
administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or a
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in Section
183.062(8) of this chapter. However, a tax administrator shall not require an
alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would require a
taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation solely
because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
   (M)    Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in this section
is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages pursuant to
Section
183.05 of this Chapter. (Ord. 97-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)

      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in

   (B)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section 183.30 of
this Chapter, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (b)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section 183.30 of this Chapter is
terminated, a valid election made under Section 183.36 of this Chapter is
binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
183.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
183.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
183.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
183.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
183.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
183.062 of Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed in accordance with this Chapter on the corporation, an
affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the
taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.
   (H)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may continue to file
consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the City. If
a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured as a percentage of
the new income tax revenue the City derives from new employees of the taxpayer
and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years. Before the City passes an
ordinance granting a credit, the City and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)

fifteen years. Before the City passes an ordinance allowing such a credit, the
City and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the
conditions of the credit.

183.07 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due for the taxable year,
after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and after applying

year.
   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the
first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.

provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City or Tax
Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first

fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety per cent of the
tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
183.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
183.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of

         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City under Section
183.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    The Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

183.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
183.081 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID TO ANOTHER MUNICIPALITY.
   (A)   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the City and who receives
salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation or net profits from sales
made, work done, or services performed or rendered outside of the City, if it
is established with supporting documentation that said income is subject to
municipal income tax in another municipality, or if it can be demonstrated that
said taxpayer has paid a municipal income tax based on income taxable under
this chapter, shall be allowed a credit for the amount so paid to such other
municipality. The credit shall not exceed 1.25% of the income subject to the
tax of such other municipality. The credit shall not be allowed for taxes
erroneously paid to another municipality. If it is established that said tax
was withheld or paid to another municipality, but that the taxpayer had no
legal obligation to pay said tax, no credit for said tax shall be permitted.
   (B)   A resident of the City who has sustained a net loss arising from a
business activity in another municipality shall be subject to the same
reduction. Eighty-three percent (83%) of said loss can be used to offset other
taxable business income.

county, state or federal taxing authority.
   (D)   A partial year resident must pro-rate credit for taxes owed and paid
to another municipality, reflecting the applicable credit for the income taxed
while the taxpayer was a resident of the City.

subsection (A), there is allowed an additional credit of 0.25% of the income
subject to the tax of such other municipality.

(Ord. 46-2017. Passed 6-19-17.)
183.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)    For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident of the
City who works in a joint economic development zone created under section
715.691 or a joint economic development district created under section 715.70,
715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent that it grants a
credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
183.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the City, but should
have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is allowable by
the City as a refund, but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
183.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the City, but
was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall be subject to
collection and recovery by the City. To the extent a refund of such tax or
withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as provided in Section
183.096, the City will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax or
withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the City
claims is due. If the City's tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net
difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection by the City, along
with any penalty and interest accruing during the period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
183.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires the City to allow credit for tax paid
to another municipal corporation if the City has reduced credit for tax paid to
another municipal corporation. Section
183.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.09 ANNUAL RETURN.
183.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal Taxable Income by the City shall be completed and filed by every
taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the tax,

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the City under subsection
183.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the City.
      (3)   All resident individual taxpayers, sixteen (16) years of age and
older, shall file an annual municipal income tax return with the City,
regardless of income or liability.

individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City in accordance with this Chapter, the return or notice
required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the individual's
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such duly
authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged
with the care of the person or property of that individual shall provide, with
the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support that they are
authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer. This notice
shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact information
including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized agent,
guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary
shall provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to
support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer. This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by the City. The department of taxation shall publish a method
of electronically submitting the documents required under this division through
the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department shall
transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to the
appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the City or Tax
Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period. The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the City or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City in accordance with this Chapter, the
Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments
otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not otherwise
required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
183.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
183.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
183.092 of this Chapter prevails.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount due
is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the City an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this section.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) of Section
183.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this Chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is required to be made by
electronic funds transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the
date of the timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that
payment. For purposes of this section, "submitted the payment" means the date
which the taxpayer has designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may
not be the same date as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
183.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with
the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return. The return
or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the return, to contact
the Tax Administrator for information about the examination or other review of
the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond
to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator and has shown to the preparer
or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of another person to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return does not
preclude the Tax Administrator from contacting the taxpayer regarding such
matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City in accordance with
this Chapter, provided that the generic form, once completed and filed,
contains all of the information required by ordinances, resolutions, or rules
adopted by the City or Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax
return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions
of this Chapter and of the City's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing
of returns, reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
183.052 of this Chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this Chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this Chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
      (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the City in the taxable year.
It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the provisions of
this Chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal taxable income
on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit has been filed
with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in division (N) of
this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an audit of the
person. (Ord. 34-2016. Passed 9-6-16.)
183.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator for both an
extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for payment
of taxes required by the City in accordance with this Chapter during the period
of the member's or civilian's duty service and for one hundred eighty days
thereafter. The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred
eightieth day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant
shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to
demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the City before the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the City in accordance with this
Chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this
section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the
taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this section,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of the
United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of the City
income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall be the 15th
day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this Chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (G)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a City income
tax return under division (A), (E), or (F) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.
   If a tax administrator violates this division (G) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
   This division (G) of this section does not apply to an extension received
under this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that the
taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the
extension under this section or failed to file for an extension under division
(C) of this section. (Ord. 96-2023. Passed 11-20-23.)
183.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the City in accordance with this
Chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
183.19 of this Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of Section
183.19 of this Chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond
the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the City to the taxpayer. Except as set forth
in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
183.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
         (Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
City, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of
employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the City:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
183.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
183.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
183.10 of this Chapter.

before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules, as adopted from time to time before January 1, 2016 of
this City..
   (C)   The City shall impose on a taxpayer, employer, any agent of the
employer, and any other payer, and will attempt to collect, the interest
amounts and penalties prescribed in this section when the taxpayer, employer,
any agent of the employer, or any other payer for any reason fails, in whole or
in part, to make to the City timely and full payment or remittance of income
tax, estimated income tax, or withholding tax or to file timely with the City
any return required to be filed.
      (1)   Interest shall be imposed at the rate defined as "interest rate as
described in division (A) of this section", per annum, on all unpaid income
tax, unpaid estimated income tax, and unpaid withholding tax. This imposition
of interest shall be assessed per month, or fraction of a month.
      (2)   With respect to unpaid income tax and unpaid estimated income tax,
a penalty equal to fifteen percent of the amount not timely paid shall be
imposed.
      (3)   With respect to any unpaid withholding tax, a penalty not to exceed
fifty percent of the amount not timely paid shall be imposed.
      (4)   With respect to returns other than estimated income tax returns,
the City shall impose a monthly penalty of twenty-five dollars for each failure
to timely file each return, regardless of the liability shown thereon for each
month, or any fraction thereof, during which the return remains unfiled
regardless of the liability shown thereon. The penalty shall not exceed a total
of one hundred fifty dollars in assessed penalty for each failure to timely
file a return.
         For taxable years beginning with taxable year 2023, with respect to
returns other than estimated income tax returns, the City shall impose a
monthly penalty not exceeding twenty-five dollars for each failure to timely
file each return, regardless of the liability shown thereon except that the
City shall abate or refund the penalty assessed on a taxpayer's first failure
to timely file a return after the taxpayer files that return.
   (D)   With respect to income taxes, estimated income taxes, withholding
taxes, and returns, the City shall not impose, seek to collect, or collect any
penalty, amount of interest, charges or additional fees not described in this
section.
   (E)   With respect to income taxes, estimated income taxes, withholding

interest, charges, or additional fees that were properly imposed or collected
before January 1, 2016.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may, in the Tax Administrator's sole discretion,
abate or partially abate penalties or interest imposed under this section when

appropriate. Such abatement or partial abatement shall be properly documented
and maintained on the record of the taxpayer who received benefit of such
abatement or partial abatement.
   (G)   The City shall impose on the taxpayer, employer, any agent of the
employer, or any other payer the City's post-judgment collection costs and

183.11 AUDIT.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, as defined in Section
183.03(3) of this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall provide to the taxpayer
a written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right
to obtain a refund of an overpayment of tax. At or before the commencement of
an audit, the Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.12 ROUNDING.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar. If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)

including without limitation:
   (A)   Exercise all powers whatsoever of an inquisitorial nature as provided
by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to

or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax
Administrator's findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the
taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as provided in this Chapter;
   (E)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to the

Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner

      (Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this Chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the City:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that the Tax Administrator believes is subject
to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the City or for the withholding of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this Chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
183.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
183.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
183.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
183.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
183.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.14 CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the City is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the City as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter or
ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax
Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.15 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the City or the Tax Administrator.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the City in accordance with
this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the City's income
tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and conclusion of
the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the City's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the City in order to obtain a
more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
183.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If the Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    The Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds the Tax Administrator only with respect to
opinions of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of any other municipal corporation's tax administrator
does not bind the City.
   (I)    The Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The Council of the City shall maintain a Local Board of Tax
Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the City.
Two members shall be appointed by the Council of the City, and may not be
employees, elected officials, or contractors with the City at any time during
their term or in the five years immediately preceding the date of appointment.
One member shall be appointed by the Mayor of the City. This member may be an
employee of the City, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent
officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee
directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the Council of the City shall be two years. There is no limit on the number of
terms that a member may serve should the member be reappointed by the Council.
The board member appointed by the Mayor of the City shall serve at the
discretion of the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the Council may be
removed by the Council as set forth in Section 718.11(A)(4) of the Revised
Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the Council or Mayor
that appointed the member shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve
on the board in the member's place. This appointment shall be subject to the
same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the
member temporarily unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (B)    Whenever the Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in
Section
183.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.

183.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
183.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
183.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the

      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the City, pursuant to
this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator to adopt rules to
administer the income tax imposed by the City.

   (B)   All employers, contractors or subcontractors who work in the City
shall register with the Tax Administrator and shall present a list of all
employees, subcontractors, contractors or others who may do work for them whose
profits, wages or earnings are not presently subject to withholding of the City
income tax. All business and individual questionnaires must be returned within

   (D)   Whoever violates these sections shall be subject to a fine of five
dollars ($5.00) a day for each day they remain in violation.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.22 DECLARATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (A)   The Home Rule Amendment of the Ohio Constitution, Article XVIII,
Section 3, provides that "Municipalities shall have authority to exercise all
powers of local self-government," and the municipal taxing power is one of such
powers of local self-government delegated by the people of the State to the
people of municipalities.
   (B)   Article XIII, Section 6 of the Ohio Constitution provides that the
General Assembly may restrict a municipalities power of taxation to the extent
necessary to prevent abuse of such power, and Article XVIII, Section 13 of the
Ohio Constitution states that "laws may be passed to limit the powers of
municipalities to levy taxes and incur debts for local purposes."
   (C)   The General Assembly has determined that it is necessary and
appropriate to comprehensively review and amend Chapter 718 of the Ohio Revised
Code, setting forth statutory requirements for municipal income tax codes in
Ohio.
   (D)   More specifically, the General Assembly enacted H. B. 5 in December
2014, and mandated that municipal income tax codes be amended by January 1,
2016 such that any income or withholding tax is "levied in accordance with the
provisions and limitations specified in [Chapter 718]."
   (E)   Upon a detailed review of H. B. 5 and the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Heath, State of Ohio, this Ordinance is found and determined by the
Council of the City of Heath, State of Ohio, to enact the amendments required
prior to the January 1, 2016 deadline to be in accord with the provisions and
limitations specified in Chapter 718 of the Revised Code.
   (F)   Council also finds and determines that the constitutionality of
certain provisions of the state-mandated code may have been put in question by
recent decisions of the Ohio Supreme Court regarding, among other things,
taxation of professional athletes, but these provisions must be included if the
municipal income tax code is to be "levied in accordance with the provisions
and limitations specified in [Chapter 718]" and thus reluctantly are adopted by
the Council but are disclaimed to the extent they are unlawful or
unconstitutional.
(Ord. 78-2015. Passed 11-2-15.)
183.40 FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF
CHAPTER.
   (A)    A taxpayer may elect to be subject to Sections
183.40 to

remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of
the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in Section
183.41(C) of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)   The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances, and any applicable provision of Chapter
5703. of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the tax commissioner and the City, on a form prescribed by the tax
commissioner.
      (2)   (a)   The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and the City of its
termination of the election.
         (b)   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances, and is instead subject to the provisions set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (C)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances. In addition to any other powers conferred
upon the tax commissioner by law, the tax commissioner may:
      (1)   Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)   Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the
duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (D)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
183.03 of the City Codified Ordinances. (Ord. 61-2019. Passed 12-30-19.)
183.41 DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not
consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating
to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII
of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the Revised
Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference
in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the definition in this section shall control
for all uses of that term in Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)   "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under Section
183.42 of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)   "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
Section
183.46 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division(E)(3)(b) of Section
183.46 of the Codified Ordinances.
         If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity
that has made the election described in division (L)(2) of Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in division (D)(5) of Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under
section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States treasury regulations.
Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with
respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health
insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance
for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or
former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
         Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing
the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed
as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes
of federal self-employment tax.
   (C)   "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in Section
183.03(47) of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)   "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal income
taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)   "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to Section
183.50 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 61-2019. Passed 12-30-19.)
183.42 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City and that has made the election under Section
183.40 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
183.052 of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
183.50 of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)   The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
183.50 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City as
follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the City only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from a
stock of goods located within the City.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
   (E)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City in which
the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or
broker shall be allocated to the City based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the City to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (C)(12) and (R)(1)(d) of Section
183.03 of the Codified Ordinances by the City or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the City. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the City any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
      This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to
the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City under
this section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

such information, except for official purposes, in accordance with a proper
judicial order, or as provided in section 4123.271 or 5703.21 of the Revised

shall provide to the City a report stating the name and federal identification
number of every taxpayer that made estimated payments that are attributable to
the City and the amount of each such taxpayer's estimated payment.
   (D)   The information described under divisions (B) and (C) of this section
shall be provided to the individual or individuals designated by the City Tax
Administrator under section 718.83(D) of the Revised Code. (Ord. 61-2019.
Passed 12-30-19.)
183.45 FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)   For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual
return. Such return, along with the amount of tax shown to be due on the return
less the amount paid for the taxable year under Section 183.48 of the Codified
Ordinances, shall be submitted to the tax commissioner, on a form and in the
manner prescribed by the commissioner, on or before the fifteenth day of the
fourth month following the end of the taxpayer's taxable year.
      (2)   If a taxpayer has multiple taxable years ending within one calendar
year, the taxpayer shall aggregate the facts and figures necessary to compute
the tax due under this chapter, in accordance with Sections
183.41,
183.42, and, if applicable,
183.46 of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual return.
      (3)    The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of state and
in the form prescribed by the tax commissioner. If the amount payable with the
tax return is ten dollars or less, no remittance is required.
   (B)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's identification number. Each return shall be verified by a
declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   (a)   The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to include, with
each annual tax return, amended return, or request for refund filed with the
commissioner under Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances, copies of any relevant documents or other
information.
         (b)   A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission
is not available, mail the documents to the tax commissioner. The department of
taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
   (C)   (1)   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)   An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)   If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with Section
183.011 of the Codified Ordinances, the commissioner may require taxpayers to
file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this section,
including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (D)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (E)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature. (Ord. 61-
2019. Passed 12-30-19.)
183.451 ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)   All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under Section
183.40 of the Codified Ordinances shall file any tax return or extension for
filing a tax return, and shall make payment of amounts shown to be due on such
returns, electronically, either through the Ohio business gateway or in another
manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the
commissioner, to be excused from the requirement to file returns and make

   (C)   The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)   The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns and

183.46 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)   "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Section 183.40 of
the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division
(B)(1) or (2) of Section
183.063 of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Section
183.40 of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that

return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
183.41 of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of Section
183.41 of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
183.42 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net -profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
183.42 of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in Section
183.42 of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits that
would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under Section
183.42 of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from"
appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations"
for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under Section
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 61-2019. Passed 12-30-19.)
183.47 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
183.40 of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before the
date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under Section
183.50 of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. 61-2019. Passed 12-30-19.)
183.48 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined
by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 61-2019. Passed 12-30-19.)
183.49 ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)   In addition to any other penalty imposed by Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)   If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00).
      (2)   If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose a
penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)   For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)   For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under Section
183.40 of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax required
to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty equal to
fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars
($500.00) may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars ($1000.00) or one hundred per cent of the tax
required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
Section
183.51 of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
Section
183.50 of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for the
assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 61-2019. Passed 12-30-19.)
183.50 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under Section
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in Section
183.51 of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)   If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by Section
183.51 of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section. (Ord. 61-2019. Passed 12-30-19.)
183.51 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of Section
183.50 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited. (Ord. 61-2019. Passed
12-30-19.)
183.52 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
Section
183.40 of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under Section
183.50 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
Section
183.51 of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that section. An application filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
183.51 of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 61-2019. Passed 12-30-19.)
183.53 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)   The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to Sections
183.40 to
183.55 of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to Sections

inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)   The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

is to be
applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
tax commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax
commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the City and taxpayer under Section
183.064 or
183.065 of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or conditions of any

from prosecuting any and all other offenses that may apply.
(Ord. 61-2019. Passed 12-30-19.)
183.97 COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (A)   This Chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and proceedings for collecting any tax so

continue in full force and effect until all of the taxes levied in the

185.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered to guests, and are used for the accommodation of such guests, whether
such rooms are in one or several structures.
(Ord. 65-2010. Passed 12-6-10.)
   (b)   "Transient guests" means persons occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (c)   "Vendor" means the person who is the owner or operator of the hotel
and who furnishes the lodging.
(Ord. 73-89. Passed 9-18-89.)
185.02 IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to meet the needs of
the City for the use of the general revenue fund of the City, an excise tax is
hereby levied on transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be
furnished to transient guests.
(Ord. 73-89. Passed 9-18-89.)
 
   (b)   The tax is three percent (3%) of the amount paid or to be paid by the
transient guest for the lodging. The tax applies and is collectible at the time
the lodging is furnished regardless of the time when the price is paid.
(Ord. 65-2010. Passed 12-6-10.)
 
   (c)   For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter, and to
prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by
hotels in this City to transient guests is subject to the tax until the
contrary is established.
(Ord. 73-89. Passed 9-18-89.)
185.03 TRANSIENT GUEST TO PAY TAX.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient guest to the
vendor, and each vendor shall collect from the transient guest the full and
exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
(Ord. 65-2010. Passed 12-6-10.)
185.04 REFUND OF ILLEGAL OR ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS.
   The City Auditor shall refund to vendors the amount of taxes paid illegally
or erroneously or paid on any illegal or erroneous assessment where the vendor
has not reimbursed himself from the transient guest. When such illegal or
erroneous payment or assessment was not paid to a vendor but was paid by the
transient guest directly to the City Auditor, or his agent, he shall refund to
the transient guest. Applications shall be filed with the Auditor, on the form
prescribed by him, within ninety days from the date it is ascertained that the
assessment or payment was illegal or erroneous; provided, however, that in any
event such application for refund must be filed with the Auditor within four
years from the date of the illegal or erroneous payment of the tax. On filing
of such application the Auditor shall determine the amount of refund due and
certify such amount of refund. The Auditor shall draw a warrant for such
certified amount to the person claiming such refund. The Auditor shall make
such payments from a tax refund as established by ordinance.
(Ord. 73-89. Passed 9-18-89.)
185.05 RECORDS.
   Each vendor shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter, and shall keep all invoices, and such other pertinent
documents. If the vendor furnishes lodging not subject to the tax the vendor's
records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale was
exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be open
during business hours to the inspection of the City Auditor or his agent, and
shall be preserved for a period of four years, unless the Auditor, in writing,
consents to their destruction within that period, or by order requires that
they be kept longer.
(Ord. 73-89. Passed 9-18-89.)
185.06 RETURNS REQUIRED.
   (a)   Each vendor shall, on or before the last day of October, 1989, and
before the 28th day of each month immediately following thereafter, make and
file a return for the preceding month, on forms prescribed by the Auditor,
showing the receipts from furnishing lodging, the amount of tax due from the
vendor to the City for the period covered by the return and such other
information as the Auditor deems necessary for the proper administration of
this chapter. If the 28th falls on a holiday or weekend, that tax is due on the
last business day preceding the 28th . The Auditor may extend the time for
making or filing returns.
(Ord. 65-2010. Passed 12-6-10.)
 
   (b)   Returns shall be filed by mailing the same to the City Auditor,
together with payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon.
(Ord. 73-89. Passed 9-18-89.)
 
   (c)   The Auditor may authorize vendors whose tax liability is not such as
to merit monthly returns, as determined by the Auditor upon the basis of
administration costs to the City, to make and file returns at less frequent
intervals. Such authorization shall be in writing and shall indicate the
intervals at which returns are to be filed.
 
   (d)   The Auditor shall stamp or otherwise mark on all returns the date
received by him and shall also show thereon by stamp or otherwise the amount of
payment received with the return. Any vendor who fails to file a return under
this chapter shall, for each day he so fails, forfeit and pay into the City the
sum of the five dollar ($5.00).
 
   (e)   The Auditor, if he deems it necessary in order to insure the payment
of the tax imposed by this chapter, may require returns and payments to be made
for other than monthly periods. The returns shall be signed by the vendor or
his authorized agent.
(Ord. 65-2010. Passed 12-6-10.)
185.07 LIABILITY OF HOTEL AND TRANSIENT GUEST; ASSESSMENT; PETITION FOR
REASSESSMENT; PENALTIES.
   (a)   If any vendor collects the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter
and fails to remit the same to the City as prescribed, he shall be personally
liable for any amount collected which he failed to remit. The Auditor may make
an assessment against such vendor based upon any information in the Auditor's
possession.
 
   (b)   If any vendor fails to collect the tax or any transient guest fails to
pay the tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter on any transaction subject
to the tax, such vendor or transient guest shall be personally liable for the
amount of the tax applicable to the transaction. The Auditor may make an
assessment against either the vendor or transient guest, as the facts may
require, based upon any information in his possession.
 
   (c)   An assessment against a vendor in cases where the tax imposed by or
pursuant to this chapter has not been collected or paid, shall not discharge
the transient guest's liability to reimburse the vendor for the tax applicable
to such transaction.
 
   (d)   In each case the Auditor shall give to the vendor or transient guest
assessed written notice of such assessment. Such notice may be served upon the
vendor or transient guest assessed personally or by registered or certified
mail. An assessment issued against either, pursuant to the provisions of this
chapter shall not be considered an election or remedies, nor a bar to an
assessment against the other for the tax applicable to the same transaction,
provided that no assessment shall be issued against any vendor or transient
guest for the tax due on a particular transaction if such tax has actually been
paid by another.
 
   (e)   The Auditor may make an assessment against any vendor who fails to
file a return required by this chapter or fails to remit the proper amount of
tax in accordance with this chapter. When information in the possession of the
Auditor indicates that the amount required to be collected is, or should be,
greater than the amount remitted by the vendor, the Auditor may upon the basis
of test checks of a vendor's business for a representative period which are
hereby authorized, determine the ratio which the tax required to be collected
under this chapter bears to the hotel's lodging, which determination shall be
the basis of an assessment as herein provided in this chapter. Notice of such
assessment shall be made in the manner prescribed in this chapter.
 
   (f)   Unless the vendor or transient guest, to whom such notice of
assessment is directed, files within thirty days after service thereof, either
personally or by registered or certified mail a petition in writing, verified
under oath by such vendor, transient guest or his authorized agent, having
knowledge of the facts, setting forth with particularity the items of such
assessment objected to, together with the reasons for such objections, such
assessment shall become conclusive and the amount thereof shall be due and
payable, from the vendor or transient guest so assessed, to the City Auditor.
When a petition for reassessment is filed, the Auditor shall assign a time and
place for the hearing of same and shall notify the petitioner thereof by
registered or certified mail, but the Auditor may continue the hearings from
time to time if necessary.
 
   (g)   A penalty of fifteen percent (15%) shall be added to the amount of
every assessment made under this chapter. The Auditor may adopt and promulgate
rules and regulations providing for the remission of penalties added to
assessments made under this chapter.
 
   (h)   When any vendor or transient guest files a petition for reassessment
as provided in this chapter, the assessment made by the Auditor, together with
penalties thereon, shall become due and payable within three days after notice
of the finding made at the hearing has been served, either personally or by
registered or certified mail, upon the party assessed.
(Ord. 73-89. Passed 9-18-89.)
185.08 FOUR-YEAR LIMITATION FOR ASSESSMENTS; EXCEPTIONS.
   No assessment shall be made or issued against a vendor or transient guest
for any tax imposed by or pursuant to this chapter more than four years after
the return date for the period in which the lodging was furnished, or more than
four years after the return for such period is filed, whichever is later. The
division does not bar an assessment:
   (a)   When the Auditor has substantial evidence of amounts of taxes
collected by a vendor from transient guests' lodging which were not returned by
the City.
   (b)   When the vendor assessed failed to file a return as required.
      (Ord. 73-89. Passed 9-18-89.)
185.09 TAX PAID BY TRANSIENT GUEST; FALSE EVIDENCE OF TAX-EXEMPT STATUS.
   (a)   No transient guest shall refuse to pay the full and exact tax as
required by this chapter, or present to the vendor false evidence indicating
that the lodging as furnished is not subject to the tax.
 
   (b)   No vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by
this chapter. No vendor shall refund, remit or rebate to a transient guest,
either directly or indirectly, any of the tax levied pursuant to this chapter,
or make in any form of advertising, verbal or otherwise, any statements which
might imply that he is absorbing the tax for the transient guest by an
adjustment of prices, or furnishing lodging at a price including the tax, or
rebating the tax in any other manner.
(Ord. 73-89. Passed 9-18-89.)
185.10 REPORTS TO BE FILED; FRAUDULENT REPORTS.
   (a)   No person, including any officer of a corporation or employee of a
corporation having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility
of filing returns, shall fail to file any return or report required to be filed
by this chapter or file or cause to be filed any incomplete, false or
fraudulent return, report or statement, or aid or abet another in the filing of
any false or fraudulent return, report or statement.
(Ord. 73-89. Passed 9-18-89.)
 
   (b)   If any vendor required to file monthly returns under this chapter
fails, on three consecutive months or more within a twelve-month period, to
file such returns when due or to pay the tax thereon, or if any vendor
authorized by the Auditor to file returns at less frequent intervals, fails on
two or more occasions within a twelve month period, to file such returns when
due or to pay the tax due thereon, the Auditor may:
(Ord. 65-2010. Passed 12-6-10.)
      (1)   Require such vendor to furnish security in an amount equal to the
average tax liability of the vendor for a period of one year, as determined by
the Auditor from a review of returns or other information pertaining to such
vendor, which amount shall in no event be less than one hundred dollars
($100.00). The security may be in the form of an advance tax payment to be
applied to pay the tax due on subsequent returns, or a corporate surety bond,
satisfactory to the Auditor, conditioned upon payment of the tax due with the
returns from the vendor. The security must be filed within ten days following
the vendor's receipt of the notice from the Auditor of its requirements.
      (2)   A corporate surety bond filed under this section shall be returned
to the vendor if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date
the bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and remitted payment
therewith within the time prescribed in this chapter.
(Ord. 73-89. Passed 9-18-89.)
185.11 PERSONAL LIABILITY OF CORPORATE OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES.
   If any vendor corporation required to file returns and to remit the tax due
to the City under the provisions of this chapter fails for any reason to make
such filing or payment, any of its officers or employees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing returns and making
payments, shall be personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a
corporation shall not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a
prior failure of the corporation to file returns or remit tax due. The sum due
for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in
this chapter.
(Ord. 73-89. Passed 9-18-89.)
185.12 INTENT OF CHAPTER.
   It is the intent of this chapter to levy the excise tax of three percent
(3%) on transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to
transient guests as referred to and authorized by Division (C) of Ohio R.C.
5739.02. Accordingly, this chapter shall be construed to effectuate that
purpose and so as to be consistent with any requirement of law, compliance with
which is a prerequisite to the validity of the tax intended to be levied
hereby.
(Ord. 73-89. Passed 9-18-89.)
185.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any section of this chapter shall be fined not less than
one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than three hundred dollars ($300.00) for
the first offense. For each subsequent offense such person shall, if a
corporation, be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), nor more
than five hundred dollars ($500.00), or if an individual, or a member of a
partnership, firm or association, be fined not less than one hundred dollars
($100.00) nor more than two hundred dollars ($200.00), or imprisoned not more
than sixty days, or both.

   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner or
operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle. That fee
may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction.
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.

removed, the date and time of its removal, the telephone number of the person
from whom it may be recovered, and the address of the place to which it has
been taken and from which it may be recovered. The chief shall provide any
information in the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any
person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection
(a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law enforcement agency
with which the complaint was registered to any person who identifies self as
the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining
to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 or, if the
vehicle was towed within a municipal corporation that has established fees for
vehicle removal and storage, payment of all applicable fees established by the
municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the
vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle
shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.
      (3)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:

the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private

pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,

retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in
addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the
vehicle.

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of

that is left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-
two hours with the permission of the person having the right to the possession
of the property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the chief of a law enforcement agency, a state highway patrol
trooper or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send notice by certified mail

of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being

property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open

court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of- way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)
313.04 LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
(ORC 4511.99)
313.05 SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described in this section when a person submits to
a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request of a law
enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an
emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a
blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood
under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this subsection, if in
that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered
by the withdrawing of blood.
            The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof
shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health
by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, "emergency
medical technician-intermediate" and "emergency medical technician-paramedic"
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, "emergency medical technician-intermediate" and
"emergency medical technician-paramedic" have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

(a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C. 4507.03,
4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public road or
highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of

driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a commercial driver's
license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.

instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio
R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to

subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,

GARAGES.
   (a)   Every vehicle stopped or parked upon a roadway where there is an
adjacent curb shall be stopped or parked with the curb side wheels of such
vehicle parallel with and not more than twelve inches from the curb, unless it

as close to the curb as possible and only for the time necessary to discharge
and receive passengers or to load or unload merchandise.
   (b)   (1)   This subsection does not apply to streets or parts thereof where

width available for free-moving traffic at the location of that angled parking
space, unless the municipal corporation approves of the elimination of the
angled parking space.
         B.   Replacement, repainting or any other repair performed by or on
behalf of the municipal corporation of the lines that indicate the angled
parking space does not constitute an intent by the municipal corporation to

lights are displayed as may be prescribed by the Ohio Director of
Transportation.
   (e)   Accessible parking locations and privileges for persons with
disabilities that limit or impair the ability to walk shall be provided and

garages. The locations shall be designated through the posting of an elevated
sign, whether permanently affixed or movable, imprinted with the international
symbol of access and shall be reasonably close to exits, entrances, elevators,
and ramps. All elevated signs posted in accordance with this division and Ohio
R.C. 3781.111(C) shall be mounted on a fixed or movable post, and the distance
from the ground to the bottom edge of the sign shall measure not less than five
feet. If a new sign or a replacement sign designating an accessible parking
location is posted on or after October 14, 1999, there also shall be affixed
upon the surface of that sign or affixed next to the designating sign a notice
that states the fine applicable for the offense of parking a motor vehicle in
the designated accessible parking location if the motor vehicle is not legally
entitled to be parked in that location.
   (f)   (1)   A.   No person shall stop, stand or park any motor vehicle at
accessible parking locations provided under subsection (e) of this section, or

owned parking lots, parking garages, or other parking areas and designated in
accordance with that division, unless one of the following applies:

a person with a disability and is displaying a parking card or accessible
license plates.
         B.   Any motor vehicle that is parked in an accessible marked parking
location in violation of subsections (f)(1)A.1. or (f)(1)A.2. of this section
may be towed or otherwise removed from the parking location by the law
enforcement agency of the municipality. A motor vehicle that is so towed or
removed shall not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of
ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the
lessee presents proof that the person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and
pays all towing and storage fees normally imposed by the municipality for
towing and storing motor vehicles.
         C.   If a person is charged with a violation of subsections (f)(1)A.1.
or (f)(1)A.2. of this section, it is an affirmative defense to the charge that
the person suffered an injury not more than seventy-two hours prior to the time
the person was issued the ticket or citation and that, because of the injury,
the person meets at least one of the criteria contained in Ohio R.C. 4503.44(A)

provided under subsection (e) of this section or at an accessible clearly
marked parking location provided in or on a privately owned parking lot,
parking garage, or other parking area and designated in accordance with that
division.
   (g)   When a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a
person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is
displaying a removable windshield placard or accessible license plates, or when
a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a person with a
disability, and is displaying a parking card or accessible license plates, the
motor vehicle is permitted to park for a period of two hours in excess of the
legal parking period permitted by local authorities, except where local
ordinances or police rules provide otherwise or where the vehicle is parked in
such a manner as to be clearly a traffic hazard.
   (h)   No owner of an office, facility, or parking garage where accessible
parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with subsection
(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license
plates if the parking card or accessible license plates, issued to the person
or organization under prior law have not expired or been surrendered or
revoked.
   (j)   As used in this section:

      (1)   Whenever there are four inches or more of fallen snow, or whenever
the Mayor finds, on the basis of three inches or more of falling snow, or on
the basis of a forecast of three inches or more of snow, that such conditions
will make it necessary that vehicular traffic be expedited and that parking on
City streets or highways be prohibited or restricted for snowplowing, there
shall be put into effect a parking prohibition on parts or all streets or
highways as necessary by declaring it in the manner prescribed by this section.
The prohibition shall remain in effect until terminated by announcement of the
Mayor.
         (Ord. 34-93. Passed 9-20-93.)
      (2)   While the prohibition is in effect, no person shall park or allow

by him pursuant to this section to be publicly announced by means of broadcasts
or telecasts from stations with a normal operating range covering the City, and

circulation when feasible. Each announcement shall describe the action taken by
the Mayor, including the time it became or will become effective, and shall
specify the streets or areas affected.
   (e)   Termination of Parking Prohibition. Whenever the Mayor shall find that
some or all of the conditions which gave rise to a parking prohibition in
effect pursuant to this section no longer exists, he may declare the
prohibition terminated in whole or in part, in the same manner as provided for
declaring a snow emergency. Termination of the parking prohibition shall be
effective immediately upon announcement.
   (f)   Provision Temporarily Effective to Take a Precedence. Any provision of
this section which becomes effective by declaration of the Mayor, while
temporarily in effect, takes precedence over any other conflicting provisions
of law normally in effect, except that it shall not take precedence over
provisions of law relating to traffic accidents, emergency travel of authorized
emergency vehicles, or emergency traffic directions by a police officer.
   (g)   Removal, Impounding, and Return of Vehicles.
      (1)   Members of the Police Department are hereby authorized to remove or
have removed a vehicle which is left on any street during a declared snow

his identity and right to possession of the vehicle, shall sign a receipt for
its return, shall pay the cost of removal and shall pay any cost of storage
accrued.

each vehicle removed in accordance with this section. The record shall include
a description of the vehicle, its license number, the date and time of its
removal, where it was removed from, its location, the name and address of its
owner and last operator, if known, and its final disposition.
      (4)   This section shall be supplemental to any other provisions of law

   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them:
   (a)   "Parking meter" means a mechanical device installed for the regulation

legal parking time or overtime parking by an appropriate signal at the
expiration of such lawful time.
   (b)   "Parking meter space" means a space within a parking meter area, which
is designated for the parking of a single vehicle by marked lines on the curb
or paved surface area adjacent to a parking meter. Posted notice on the meter
or on signs shall indicate the maximum consecutive parking time limit during
which a vehicle may be legally parked in a particular parking meter space and
the days and hours when the requirement to deposit lawful coin shall apply.
353.02 PARKING WITHIN MARKED LINES OF METER SPACE.

   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct which, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense which was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented its
commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                               $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

         (Ord. 56-87. Passed 9-8-87.)
   (b)   Public Nuisances-Enumerated; Prohibited. No person shall create,
permit or maintain a public nuisance. The following shall be deemed to

any a manner other than as provided by this Code or other ordinances or health
regulations of the City.
      (2)   The accumulation or storage of junk at any place except in a wholly
enclosed building or structure, provided, however, that this subsection shall

521.08(a)(1) as “Garbage,” must be placed in approved garbage containers as
defined in following paragraph and cannot be stored outside a premises or
establishment for more than seven days. Items defined as “Junk, Refuse, Trash

preventing displacement by weather, animals or uncontrolled activities.

caused by weather or unexpected construction conditions.
            (Ord. 27-2008. Passed 5-19-08.)
   (c)   Inspection; Right of Entry. For the purpose of enforcing the

reasonable cause to believe that a public nuisance as defined in this chapter
exists.
   (d)   Collector's Vehicle. Any unlicensed or not currently licensed
collector's vehicle stored in the open with the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property shall conceal such vehicle by means
of buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction.
   (e)   Abatement.
      (1)   The Division of Building and Zoning Inspection may abate a nuisance
as defined in this section by giving notice, either in person or by certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the person having the right of possession of
the property on which garbage, junk, refuse or a junk motor vehicle is left,
that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the garbage, junk, refuse or the
junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other
suitable structure, or shall be removed from the property.
      (2)   No person shall willfully leave garbage, junk, refuse or a junk
motor vehicle uncovered in the open for more than ten days after receipt of a
notice as provided in this section. The fact that garbage, junk, refuse or a
junk motor vehicle is so left is a prima facie evidence of willful failure to
comply with the notice and each subsequent period of thirty days that garbage,
junk, refuse or a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a
separate offense.
   (f)   Littering; Deposits Prohibited.
      (1)   No person shall, without lawful authority, place or dispose of in
any manner, upon any public property or upon the premises of another, any
paper, trash, garbage, waste, rubbish, refuse, junk or any substance or
material which is or may become noxious, offensive, injurious or dangerous to
the public health, comfort or safety.
      (2)   No person shall cause or allow trash, garbage, waste, rubbish,
refuse or any other noxious or offensive materials or substances to be
collected or remain in any place to the damage or prejudice of others of the
public or unlawfully obstruct, impede, divert, corrupt or render unwholesome or
impure any natural watercourse.
         (Ord. 30-79. Passed 5-21-79.)
      (3)   No person shall cause or allow grass or leaves to be collected or
remain in place in or upon a highway, lane, road or street. Grass clippings and
leaves are not to be discharged in or upon a highway, lane, road or street,
unless it is cleaned-up/removed afterwards.
         (Ord. 57-2004. Passed 8-2-04.)
   (g)   Spillage Prohibited. It hereby is declared a nuisance, and no person
shall transport in any vehicle of any kind, rubbish, garbage, refuse or trash
of any kind unless such vehicle shall be properly equipped with a cover, lid,
tarpaulin or enclosure designed effectively to prevent such transported
materials from spilling or falling from such vehicle upon the public streets
and highways.
(Ord. 57-87. Passed 9-8-87.)
   (h)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates subsection (f) and (g) hereof is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree on a first offense; on a second offense, such
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree; on each subsequent
offense, such person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree.
      (2)   Whoever violates any other of the provisions of this section is
guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a first offense; on a second offense, such
person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; on each subsequent
offense, such person is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.
      (3)   In addition to the penalties provided in subsection (h)(1) and (2)
hereof following conviction, and while the nuisance continues, the Division of
Building and Zoning Inspection may cause written notice to abate such public
nuisance to be served either in person or by certified mail return receipt
requested upon the person convicted and the owner of the premises, if other
than the persons convicted. The notice shall state the nature of the public
nuisance and the time, not less than fifteen days following service of the
notice, within which the public nuisance shall be abated. If, by the time
stated, the public nuisance has not been abated, the Division of Building and
Zoning Inspection may cause it to be abated and, if abated, forward the cost to
the Licking County Auditor for addition to the tax duplicate, or, in the case
of vehicles, instruct the Heath Police Department to impound the vehicle(s) and
be reimbursed for fees either through arrangements with the owner or public
auction. Such demand shall be in writing and shall contain a notice that a
lawsuit may be commenced to recover the cost of abating the nuisance after
fifteen days from the date of the demand for payment. If such payment is not
forthcoming within fifteen days from the date of the demand for payment, the
City Auditor shall notify the Law Director of the steps taken to recover the
costs of abating the nuisance, from the person who created, permitted or
maintained the public nuisance.
   (Ord. 30-79. Passed 5-21-79; Ord. 60-83. Passed 6-6-83; Ord. 92-2007. Passed

521.16  DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this Chapter:
   (a)    Cartridge-based electronic nicotine delivery systems (or ENDS)
products are a type of ENDS product that consists of, includes, or involves a
cartridge or pod that holds liquid that is to be aerosolized through product
use. For purposes of this definition, a cartridge or pod is any small, enclosed
unit (sealed or unsealed) designed to fit within or operate as part of an
electronic nicotine delivery system. An example of products that would not be
captured by this definition include completely self-contained, disposable
products.
   (b)    ENDS products include devices, components, and/or parts that deliver
aerosolized e-liquid when inhaled. For example, the federal Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) considers vapes or vape pens, personal vaporizers, e-
eigarettes, cigalikes, e-pens, e-hookahs, e-cigars, and e-pipes to be ENDS.
   (c)    E-liquids are a type of ENDS product and generally refer to liquid
nicotine and nicotine-containing e-liquids (i.e., liquid nicotine combined with
colorings, flavorings, and/or other ingredients). Liquids that do not contain
nicotine or other material made or derived from tobacco, but that are intended
or reasonably expected to be used with or for the human consumption of a
tobacco product, may be components or parts and, therefore, subject to FDA's
tobacco control authorities.
   (d)   Tobacco product means any product made or derived from tobacco that is
intended for human consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of
a tobacco product (except for raw materials other than tobacco used in
manufacturing a component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product). The term
"tobacco product" does not mean an article that under the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) is a drug (section 201 (g)(1) (21 U.S.C 321
(g)1))), a device (section 201 (h)), or a combination product (section 503(g)

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06, or
545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

761.01 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative secondary effects of
Sexually Oriented Businesses within the City in order to promote the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City. The provisions of this chapter
have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction
on the content of any communicative materials or communication, including
sexually oriented entertainment. Similarly, it is not the purpose or effect of
this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
entertainment protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by
distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Furthermore, it is not the intent or effect of this chapter to
condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of entertainment that is
obscene.
   (b)   Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects
of Sexually Oriented Businesses on the community presented to the Council; on
findings incorporated in the cases of the City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters,
Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976);
and on studies in other cities, this Council finds:
      (1)   Sexually Oriented Businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful
and unhealthy activities.
      (2)   Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at
Sexually Oriented Businesses, especially those that provide private or semi-
private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually-oriented
entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases
such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
      (3)   Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that
encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
      (4)   Sanitary conditions in some Sexually Oriented Businesses are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate
those activities and maintain their facilities.
      (5)   Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in
areas of Sexually Oriented Businesses where persons view sexually oriented
films.
      (6)   The findings noted in paragraphs number (1) through (5) raise
substantial governmental concerns.
      (7)   Sexually Oriented Businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (8)   A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
regulate the owners and operators of Sexually Oriented Businesses. Further,
such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on
   operators to see that Sexually Oriented Businesses are run in a manner
consistent with the health, safety and welfare of patrons and employees, as

application with the Sexually Oriented Business Use Commissioner. The Sexually
Oriented Business Use Commissioner shall grant an application for renewal of a
provisional license unless it is determined that new grounds exist for denial
of a license application, which did not exist at the time of the original

denial; the City has the right to consolidate such review with the pending
judicial appeal of the previous license denial. (Ord. 84-01. Passed 11-19-01.)

921.01 RULES AND REGULATIONS; ESTABLISHMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.
   The following rules and regulations are hereby established for the
operation, maintenance and protection of the Municipal water and sewer systems
in the City, such rules and regulations to be administered by responsible
personnel of the Division of Utilities.
   (a)   The public water and sewer systems of the City, including all water
mains, laterals, valves, hydrants, meters, manholes, lift stations, sewer lines
and services shall be under the exclusive control of the Division of Utilities
and its authorized agents and employees. Such control shall include all piping
from the City mains to the point of ultimate consumption or where the City
water if finally discharged freely at atmospheric pressure.
   (b)   No person shall make or maintain a physical connection between any
other source of water or liquid and the public water supply piping. No spigot
or outlet shall be physically connected to a sewer or drain, nor shall such be
below a tree overflow or submerged. If such a connection is made, it will be
considered as a cross connection and if not removed, will be just reason for
discontinuing service.
   (c)   Any person having a connection to the public water supply system who
permits public water to be wasted from such connection, either by unnecessary
use, faulty piping or to prevent freezing, or fails to prevent such wastage
shall have, after personal notification, such water connection turned off.
   (d)   No person may connect to any public water line, tamper with or remove
any meter or meter seal, or insert a meter bypass without the permission of the
Department of Service under penalty provided in this chapter and also under
penalty of having the water turned off. If the Division of Utilities finds that
a meter seal has been broken or any bypass inserted and there is evidence that
the meter has been tampered with, the water shall be shut off and shall not be
turned on again until the consumer or owner of the premises shall pay for the
estimated quantity of water which has been used and registered, and in addition
thereto a fee of twenty dollars ($20.00) for turning on such water. The
criminal laws of the State of Ohio provide severe penalties for the tampering
with water meters, meter seals, etc.
      The penalties hereinabove are in addition to the penalties provided by
the criminal laws of the State of Ohio and by making the payment hereinabove
will not in any way relieve any person from criminal prosecution.
   (e)   No person shall operate, open or otherwise tamper with any valve,
stopcock, curbcock or other device, after the same shall have been closed for a
violation of any rule or regulation of the Division of Utilities, or unlawfully
secure a supply of water through such valve, stopcock, curbcock or other device
after the same shall have been closed for the violation of any rule or
regulation of the Division of Utilities, or in any way take water for private
use unlawfully or without first having secured the necessary permit from the
authorized representative of the Division of Utilities.
   (f)   No person shall put filth, animal matter, chips, shavings or any other
substance into any City reservoir or bathe therein, or do injury thereto or
walk or ride on the turf thereof.(Ord. 61-95. Passed 6-5-95.)
   (g)   EDITOR’S NOTE: Former subsection (g) was repealed by Ordinance 88-
2009, passed November 2, 2009.
   (h)   Any person or premises desiring water and/or sewer service shall sign
an application at the water works office before water service is prohibited.
Water and/or sewer may be refused to an applicant or premise owing for previous
service. The Division of Utilities will require the owner of multi-unit rental
property, both residential and commercial, to be ultimately responsible or
jointly and severally liable with the tenant for all water and sewer bills for
the rental unit. Failure to pay the bill in accordance with provisions hereof
may result in a termination of service. (Ord. 22-2003. Passed 3-17-03.)
   (i)   Meter reading will be taken monthly and as near the same date each
month as possible. Meters/remote reader must be installed in such a manner and
place that will make them safely and readily accessible for reading. If the
meter reader is unable to obtain a reading by reason of the meter being out of
order or unable to gain access to the meter/remote reader, an estimated charge
will be made on previous readings or similar services of the same use of water.
If safe access to meter reading is not provided, Section
505.18 will be enforced.
      (Ord. 40-2004. Passed 6-7-04.)
   (j)   Any person, in person or by agent, desiring a water or sewer
connection shall make application for a permit for such connection at the
office of the Division of Utilities. There shall be but one house, apartment
unit, mobile home unit or building on each meter. There may be more than one
meter for each building. Each single family residential unit, individual
apartment unit and individual mobile home unit shall have a meter. Each meter
constitutes a separate service and each house, apartment unit, mobile home unit
or building a separate sewer lateral.
   (k)   Any person or a water user may discontinue water and sewage service by
proper notice to the office of the Division of Utilities and be relieved of
their responsibility when the water is turned off at the curb box and the
account cleared on the records of the Division of Utilities.
   (l)   Charges for construction purposes shall be due and payable at time of
purchase of a building permit and the charges shall be as follows:
      (1)   Twenty dollars ($20.00) for a residential dwelling.
      (2)   Fifty dollars ($50.00) for a commercial or manufacturing building
up to 20,000 square feet in floor area.
      (3)   For buildings over 20,000 square feet in floor area fifty dollars
($50.00) plus metered use charge. (Ord. 61-95. Passed 6-5-95.)
   (m)   Each meter size five-eights inch or greater shall be provided with a
ball valve on both inlet and outlet piping of the meter. Such shutoffs shall be
readily accessible. These valves must be functioning properly or the Division
of Utilities reserves the right to require necessary repairs to be made by the
owner. Valves that fail in the course of meter maintenance are the sole
responsibility of the property owner for repair.
   (n)   Inspectors, meter readers or employees of the Division of Utilities
whose duty it may be to enter upon private premises to examine meters, pipes or
other fixtures used in connection with the City water system shall be equipped
with a proper badge or such other credentials as the Department of Service may
deem necessary to identify them as agents of the Division of Utilities. Such
inspectors, meter readers or employees authorized by the Division of Utilities
must have free access at all reasonable hours to all parts of the building for
purpose of inspecting meters, examining fixtures, surveying for Back Flow/Back
Siphonage hazards, and observing the manner in which the water is used. In case
any authorized inspector, meter reader or employee is refused admittance to any
premises or shall be hindered or prevented from making such examination, the
water will be turned off and not turned on again until free access is given and
the turn on fee described in subsection (cc) herein has been paid. (Ord. 40-
2004. Passed 6-7- 04.)
   (o)   No plumber shall make any extensions or alterations for conducting
water into any premises until he first obtains a written permit from the
Division of Utilities office for each separate job, and must make a full and
complete report on the back of the permit of the uses for which water is
supplied. Such report must be made within forty-eight hours after the
completion of the work, and no stopcock shall be left open or water turned on
unless the permit so states.
   (p)   Whenever a break or leak occurs in a service line between the main and
the curb box, the Division of Utilities shall repair this at its own expense as
soon as possible, but if such break or leak occurs back of the curb box at any
place upon the premises supplied, the property owner shall have the break or
leak repaired at his own expense. Failure to make repairs may result in water
being turned off. Stoppages in the main sewer lines are removed by the Division
of Utilities. Stoppages from the house to the main are the property owner's
responsibility. Breakage in the sewer from the property line to the main is the
responsibility of the Division of Utilities.
   (q)   Owners of property shall be held responsible for water used in their
premises, but payments will be accepted from tenants. In case the tenants do
not pay in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Division of
Utilities, water will not be supplied to the property. All unpaid accounts
shall be a lien against the property served.
   (r)   The Division of Utilities does not guarantee any fixed pressure or
continuous supply but it will, in case of accident that will cause shortage or
water to be shut off, endeavor to notify consumers affected thereby. Those
using steam boilers and receiving their supply direct from the City mains
should have a tank large enough to hold an ample supply for emergency cases as
no claims will be considered for damage of any nature whatsoever arising from
such action. The City will not be held responsible for damages caused by
stoppages in house service laterals from the house to the main.
   (s)   EDITOR’S NOTE: Former subsection (s) was repealed by Ordinance 88-
2009, passed November 2, 2009.

water to stand pipes and sprinkler systems for fire protection only shall be
permitted when applications and plans for such service have been submitted and
approved and the classification of such service determined by the Division of
Utilities.
   (v)   No person, except an authorized agent of the Division of Utilities or
the Fire Division, or a person with a special permit from the Director of the
Division of Utilities, shall damage or disturb any fire hydrant or any part
thereof or take any water from such hydrants under any circumstances. In case
any damage is done to a fire hydrant by any person, he shall, upon demand of
the Division of Utilities, pay such damage and all cost and expense incurred by
reason thereof.
      (Ord. 61-95. Passed 6-5-95.)
   (w)   Applicants for connection with City mains for the purpose of obtaining
a supply of water for sprinkler systems must first furnish plans and
specifications of the same to the Division of Utilities for approval. Plans and
specifications shall include a detector check or equal instrument. Plans or
blueprints showing the fire system as completed, with all measurements,
outlets, etc., must be filed with the Division of Utilities office before water
will be allowed to supply the system. There will be no charge for water used
through such a system. However, a tap fee of two thousand five hundred dollars
($2,500) shall be assessed and collected.
      (Ord. 95-2008. Passed 1-5-09.)
   (x)   In case of fire the Fire Division shall have the right to use any

employer, parent or guardian of such person shall be held responsible, for the
violation or damage as well as the person committing the offense to the
Division of Utilities.
   (gg)   Whenever in these rules it is stated that notice will be given the
consumer, it signifies that notice left on or sent to the premises where water
is consumed shall be sufficient notification.
   (hh)   The Division of Utilities tries to give proper notice of water and
sewer charges, but by law cannot guarantee the delivery of such charges by
mail. Owners buying or selling properties should see that proper transfer of
ownership is made at the office of the Division of Utilities and such charges
paid to date of transfer of title. The Division of Utilities will make every
possible effort to collect water and sewer charges or assessments as promptly
as the nature and volume of its business permit, but no consumer or owner of
property shall be relieved from an obligation for assessments that may be
unpaid through failure of the Division of Utilities to make collections as
provided by its rules.

921.02 METERS.
   (a)   Every water service shall be equipped with a meter, either purchased
new from the Division of Utilities or tested and approved by the Division of
Utilities, if used. The Division of Utilities reserves the right to reject used
meters due to age or other reasons. No meter smaller than five-eighths inch by
three-fourths inch shall be installed in a new building or residence. If no
water service is provided by the City then the sewer system shall be equipped
with a meter. Meters may be equipped on both the water and sewer systems upon
the approval of the Division of Utilities.
   (b)   The Division of Utilities will, on its initiative, undertake to test
and correct any meter, which in its judgment is registering incorrectly,
without the consent of the owner. The Division of Utilities shall not be
responsible for breakage of pipes or valves occurring during the removal or
installation of meters.
   (c)   Upon request from an owner or consumer and agreement to pay for a test
charge, the Division of Utilities will remove any meter to the meter shop for
test upon payment of a twenty dollar ($20.00) fee for a five-eighths inch meter
and for all other sizes a fee of the cost of removing and testing the meter.
If, upon examination and test, it is found that the meter registers outside the
tolerance limits of five percent (5%) over or under on flows from one to twenty
gallons per minute, on all meters, types and sizes, it shall be considered
inaccurate and the water charges will be adjusted on the basis of this test. If
charges are adjusted, only the current bill will be subject to change. The
customer has the right to request a meter test at the time of each billing.
Payment of the bill constitutes acceptance of charges made.
   (d)   Meters damaged by use, abuse, misuse, accident or any act of
carelessness will be repaired by the Division of Utilities at the expense of
the owner. Meters damaged beyond repair shall be replaced by the owner of
property upon receipt of notice from the Division of Utilities.
   (e)   Meters furnished by the City shall remain the property of the City and
the cost thereof shall be included in the water tapping charges.
   (f)   All customers of the City of Heath Water Distribution System with a
compound metering device will be required to have their meter tested every
three years with a company approved by the Utilities Director, starting in the
year 2010 and shall continue each three years thereafter. Such testing shall be

929.01 SCOPE.
   The provisions of this chapter are intended to apply to property owners and
persons engaged in the installation of sewage systems.
(Ord. 106-94. Passed 10-3-94.)
929.02 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.
   (a)   All sewer laterals shall follow the rules and regulations for sewer
installations as follows:
      (1)   All sewer mains shall be constructed as to the specifications for
construction of sanitary sewers.
      (2)   All manholes shall be constructed as to the construction
specifications for manholes.
      (3)   Use of the public sewer shall be governed by rules and regulations
regarding the use of the Heath sanitary sewer system.
   (b)   Copies of the foregoing regulations may be obtained at the office of
the Division of Utilities. At any time that the sewer lines or appurtenances
need to be altered, all work must conform to City specifications as stated
above.
(Ord. 106-94. Passed 10-3-94.)
929.03 SPECIFICATIONS FOR CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Use of Public Sewers Required. The owner of any house, building, or
property which is used for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or other
purposes and abutting on any street, alley, right-of-way, or easement in which
there is or may be located a public sanitary sewer connected to the POTW for
the City is required at the owner’s expense to install suitable toilet
facilities therein and to connect such facilities by means of a building sewer
(lateral) directly to the sewer in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter, within ninety days after official notice to do so, provided that the
sewer is within 200 feet of the primary structure or house. The owner is
responsible for maintenance of the building sewer (lateral) to the point of
connection with the publicly owned sewer.
      (1)   This section shall not apply to any person served by a privately
constructed, owned, operated, and maintained wastewater sewer and wastewater
treatment facility which discharges directly to an outlet in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter and applicable State and Federal laws, further,
this section shall not apply to any house, building, or property constructed or
under construction prior to the effective date hereof, but this section shall
apply to all houses, buildings, or properties, the construction of which is
commenced after the effective date hereof.
      (2)   The City reserves the right to limit connections to sanitary sewers
if the existing sewer system or sewage treatment works do not have sufficient
capacity for the waste to be discharged from such connections.
   (b)   Service Connections; Materials of Construction. Service connections
shall consist of vitrified clay, soil, cast iron or S.D.R.-35 or American
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D3034 of a size not less than four
inches nominal, nor more than six inches maximum diameter. Vitrified clay pipe
and fittings shall conform to specifications for Extra Strength Clay Sewer Pipe
ASTM C-700-7901. Six inch pipe shall be used in new construction.
   (c)   Joints. Cast-iron soil pipe and fittings shall have all joints
properly caulked with oakum and lead.
      (1)   Vitrified clay pipe and fittings shall have "premium" type joints
conforming to Standard Specification for Compression Joints for Vitrified Clay
Pipe and fittings (ASTM Designation C425-60T77).
      (2)   Before the joint is made, both the spigot and the bell shall be
thoroughly cleaned to remove any extraneous material and shall be kept clean
until the joint is made.
   (d)   Pipe Bedding. The laying of the pipe in finished trenches shall be
commenced at the lowest point so that the spigot ends point in the direction of
the flow. All pipe shall be well bedded so that all loads on the pipe shall be
equally distributed on the pipe barrel. The bottom of the trench shall be
carefully graded, shaped and tamped to conform to the outside circumference of
the pipe before any pipe is laid. Bell holes shall be of ample size to permit
joints to be made but shall not unduly encroach upon the bottom bearing for the
pipe barrel. All rock or stones protruding above the prepared bed of pipe shall
be removed so that in no case will rock touch any pipe either along the barrel
or in bell holes. Where the base of the trench is uneven or stony, sand or
gravel shall be used for bedding. The Contractor shall place a bedding cut off
trench dam of native clay or impervious soil across and along the trench at a
point twenty to thirty feet upstream from the main line sewer wye, tee, or
saddle to retard and resist the movement of groundwater through the trench
granular bedding or backfill material. The trench dams shall be carefully
compacted and shall be three feet in thickness, as measured along the service
centerline and shall be constructed against the undistributed trench sides from
the subgrade or bottom of the stone foundation, whichever is lower, to the top
of granular bedding or backfill to a limit of six inches over the top of the
pipe.
   (e)   Pipe Bedding; Line, Grade and Location.
      (1)   All pipe shall be laid true to line and grade. Any change in
horizontal direction shall be made with long radius curves, one-eighth bends or
wye branches.
      (2)   All pipe shall be laid to a minimum grade of one-fourth inch per
foot unless otherwise approved by the Director of Utilities.
      (3)   No pipe shall be laid closer than three feet to any exterior wall,
cellar, basement, well or cistern or less than two feet deep.
      (4)   A building sewer shall be a minimum of ten feet from any household
water supply source and water service line.
   (f)   Backfill Requirements. After the pipe has been laid and the joint
completed, sand, crushed run stone, grits, bank run sand and gravel or selected
trench excavation, if approved by the Director of Utilities, shall be placed
and tamped along the sides of the pipe and worked under the sides without
"lifting" the pipe or causing other movement which will break the joint or
cause the pipe to move off alignment. The foregoing material shall be used as
backfill to halfway up the pipe. Select earth backfill shall be placed along
the sides of the pipe and thoroughly tamped in six inch layers up to the top of
the pipe. Then, using select material, the trench shall be backfilled by hand
up to a point at least six inches over the top of the pipe. Mechanical or other
means of accomplishing the balance of the backfill may then be used for filling
the remainder of the trench.
   At all trench and excavation locations which are subject to traffic, such as
in or across streets, highways and driveways, No. 9 aggregate (Ohio State
Highway Specifications) or other suitable materials, properly compacted, shall
be used for trench backfill. The pavement shall be replaced with a pavement
composed of base and wearing courses equal to the original.
   (g)   Service Connections.
      (1)   Tapping existing lines. When service lines are connected to main
sewers which have no existing wye branches installed, the contractor shall be
required to make the tap using commercially manufactured vitrified wye saddles
or cut in PVC wye. The saddles shall have an integrally cast flange that will
prevent the saddle from projecting into the main sewer. After the saddle has
been installed in the main sewer, the entire joint shall be encased in a
minimum of six inches of concrete. Provisions shall be made to prevent the
concrete from dropping into the barrel of the main sewer. The entire operation
shall be performed only when a City Inspector or Engineer is on the job site.
      (2)   Service connections at manholes. Where a connection is made to a
sanitary sewer at a manhole connection not previously provided for, it shall be
made in the wall of the manhole with a smooth channel or pipe constructed to
the sewer according to the directions of the Director of Utilities. A tee
cleanout shall be used in the mahole; two feet and higher above floor shall
require drop pipe secured to wall.
      (3)   Where a service connection is constructed for a building that is
presently discharging sewage into a septic tank or cesspool, the new service
connection shall be tapped into the existing service connection with fittings
specified in these regulations, and at some point between the building and the
septic tank or cesspool. Care shall be taken to insure a tight joint at the
connection between the new and existing service connection.
   (h)   Storm Water Connections Prohibited. No storm water or roof water
leader shall be at any time led into or connected with the sanitary sewer or
sanitary sewer service connection.
   (i)   Sewer Elevation. Whenever the elevation of the sanitary sewer is such
that it can be done, the service connection shall be brought into the building
at such an elevation that it will drain the basement. In all buildings in which
the whole or part of the drainage and plumbing system thereof lies below the
service connection, the crown of the sanitary sewer shall be connected by
gravity in an airtight receiving tank or sump and lifted by artificial means
and discharged into the service connection.
(Ord. 106-94. Passed 10-3-94.)
929.04 SEWER CHARGES; LEVY AND ASSESSMENT.

subsurface drainage, cooling water, or unpolluted industrial process water into
a sanitary sewer or the existance of any other physical condition whereby rain
water, storm water, surface water, groundwater, subsurface drainage, cooling
water, or unpolluted industrial process water is discharged into any sanitary
sewer, is hereby declared to be an illegal public nuisance. It shall be the
duty of the Utilities Director to notify the owner of every building or
premises where such nuisance exists to abate the same.
      (3)   When the public nuisance defined in subsection (c)(2) hereof exists
on or about any building or premises, no owner thereof, after receipt of notice
to abate such public nuisance or after otherwise acquiring knowledge of its
existence, shall permit or allow such nuisance to exist for more than thirty
days thereafter. It shall be the duty of every such owner to abate such
nuisance within such thirty days by eliminating the connection or other
physical condition causing such nuisance, and it shall be the further duty of
such owner forthwith to cap and seal the hole or opening thereby caused or
remaining in the sanitary sewer or pipe or drain leading therein so that fumes
cannot be emitted therefrom and so that refuse and debris cannot enter into the
sanitary sewer.
      (4)   From and after the effective date of this subsection, no person,
firm or corporation shall in constructing a new building, cause or permit
footer drains or foundation drains to be connected directly or indirectly into
a sanitary sewer.
   (d)   Authority for Control of Wastewater Discharges. For any waters or
wastes which are discharged or are proposed to be discharged which contain
compatible or incompatible pollutants other than sanitary sewage and which may
have a deleterious effect upon the sewage treatment works, processes,
equipment, or receiving waters, including violation of applicable water quality
standards, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the Utilities Director shall:
      (1)   Reject the discharge of such wastes, or
      (2)   Require pretreatment and/or control of quantities and rates of
discharge to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers.
In addition, the Utilities Director may require surcharge payment to cover the
added cost of handling, treating and disposing of the wastes.
   (e)   Discharge Prohibitions.
      (1)   Pass through and interference. No user shall discharge or cause to
be discharged, directly or indirectly, any pollutants which by their nature or
concentration will pass through or cause interference with the operation or
performance of the POTW.
      (2)   Specific prohibitions. The discharge prohibitions apply to all
users of the POTW regardless of whether or not the user is subject to
categorical pretreatment standards or any other National, State, or Local
standards or requirements. Under the discharge prohibitions, a user may not
contribute the following substances to the POTW:
         A.   Any liquids, solids, or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other
substances, to create a fire or explosion hazard or be injurious in any other
way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two
successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge
into the POTW (or at any point in the POTW) be more than ten percent (10%) of
the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) nor any single reading be more than fifteen
percent (15%) of LEL. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to,
refined or unrefined petroleum products, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene,
toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates,
percholorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides. In no instance shall
wastewater discharged have a closed cup flashpoint less than 140 degrees F. (60
degrees C.) as measured by the test methods specified in 40 CFR Part 261.21.
         B.   Any wastewater having a pH less than 6.5 or greater than 9.0
S.U., or wastewater having other corrosive property capable of causing damage
or hazard to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the POTW.
         C.   Solid or viscous substances in amounts which may cause
obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of
wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not limited to: grease, garbage
with particles greater than one-half inch in any dimension, animal guts or
tissues, manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood,
feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stones, glass, straw, wood
shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, waste paper, wood, plastics,
tar, asphalt residues, or mud.
         D.   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient
quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or
interfere with any wastewater treatment process; to result in the generation of
toxic gases, vapors or fumes which may cause a POTW worker acute health and
safety problems; to constitute a hazard to humans or animals; to create a toxic
effect in the receiving watercourse of the POTW; or to exceed the limitation
set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall
include, but not be limited, to, any pollutant identified pursuant to Section
307(A) of the Act.
         E.   Any liquids, gases or solids which either singly or by
interaction with other wastes result in toxic or malodorous gases, vapors, or
fumes which are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are
sufficient to cause a POTW worker acute health and safety problems or prevent
entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
         F.   Any substances which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other
product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums to be unsuitable for
reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case
shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance
with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting
sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the SWDA, the Clean Air Act, the
Toxic Substances Control Act, RCRA, or State criteria applicable to the sludge
management method being used.
         G.   Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES
permit or the receiving water quality standards.
         H.   Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions.
         I.   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the Wastewater Treatment Plant resulting in interference, but in no
case, wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the Wastewater
Treatment Plant which exceeds 40 degrees C (104 degrees F.).
         J.   Any pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.)
released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause
interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or
contain concentrations of pollutants that exceed for any time period longer
than fifteen minutes more than five times the average twenty-four hour
concentration, quantities or flow during normal operation.
         K.   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established in applicable
state or federal regulations.
         L.   Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human health or creates a
public nuisance.
         M.   Any wastewater containing constituents exceeding the limitations
established in this chapter. State and local requirements and discharge
limitations shall be met by all users subject to such standards where these
requirements and limitations are more stringent than federal requirements and
limitations.
         N.   Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin in amounts which cause interference or pass through.
         O.   Any trucked or hauled waste including, but not limited to,
holding tank wastes, industrial, and septic wastes, into any location of the
POTW at any time.
      (3)   Utilities Director responsibilities.
         A.   The Utilities Director shall establish additional or more
stringent limitations on wastewater strength, or more stringent specific
limitations and requirements on individual users where deemed necessary to
comply with applicable pretreatment standards or the objectives of the chapter.
         B.   The Utilities Director shall notify, in writing, each regulated
or potentially regulated user of the limitations or requirements. All
limitations and requirements established by the Utilities Director shall be
subject to the provisions of this chapter. In addition, the Utilities Director
may issue specific orders to any user or may issue general orders to all or any
group of users to require compliance with any requirements under this chapter,
including applicable categorical pretreatment standards, other discharge
limitations and reporting requirements.
         C.   When the Utilities Director determines that a user is in
violation of any of the prohibitions enumerated above to such an extent as to
interfere with the operation of the POTW or to pass through the POTW, the
Utilities Director shall:
            1.   Advise the user of the impact of his discharge on the POTW;
            2.   Develop a compliance schedule for the user, if appropriate, to
assure timely implementation of corrective actions;
            3.   Develop and issue a discharge permit containing effluent
limitations and other requirements for such user to correct the interference or
pass through.
            Nothing above precludes the Utilities Director from exercising his
enforcement authority as defined below or in any way relieves the user of his
liability for any violation.
   (f)   Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Categorical pretreatment standards
limiting the mass or concentration of pollutants discharged to the POTW shall
be in addition to the general discharge prohibitions given above. Upon the
promulgation of categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial
subcategory, the categorical standard, if more stringent than limitations
imposed in this chapter for users in that industrial subcategory, shall
supersede the limitations imposed in this chapter. The Director shall notify
all affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR
Section 403.12.
      (1)   Existing sources shall comply with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards within three years of the standards' effective date
unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the standard. Existing sources
which become categorical industrial users after promulgation of an applicable
pretreatment standard shall be considered existing industrial users except
where those users meet the definition of new source.
      (2)   New sources shall install, have in operating condition, start-up
and maintain all pollution control equipment necessary to meet applicable
categorical pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge wastewater to
the POTW. New sources shall comply with all applicable categorical pretreatment
standards within the shortest feasible time, but not more than ninety days
after the start of discharge.
   (g)   Modification of National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Where the
City's treatment works achieve consistent removal of pollutants limited by
categorical pretreatment standards, the City may apply to the approval
authority for modification of specific limits in the categorical pretreatment
standards. Consistent removal shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant
by the wastewater treatment plant to a less toxic or harmless state in the
effluent as determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in 40 CFR
Section 403.7(c)2. The City may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the
categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of 40 CFR Section 403.7
are fulfilled, and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.
      (1)   The Utilities Director may convert limits of categorical
pretreatment standards which are only expressed in terms of mass of pollutant
per unit of production to equivalent limits expressed as mass of pollutant
discharged per day, or effluent concentrations to calculate effluent limits
applicable to individual users, provided the Utilities Director uses actual
long-term production figures and actual long-term flow rates. Long-term
production figures and actual long-term flow rates are only acceptable with a
minimum of one complete representative production year. The equivalent
calculated limits shall be deemed the categorical pretreatment standards, and
applicable users shall be required to comply with these equivalent limits in
lieu of the promulgated categorical pretreatment standards from which they were
derived.
      (2)   Where categorical standards specify one limit for calculating
maximum daily discharge limits and a second limit for maximum monthly average,
or four-day average limits, the same production or flow figure shall be used to
calculate both types of equivalent limits.
      (3)   Any industrial user which has equivalent mass or concentration
effluent limits calculated from a production-based categorical pretreatment
standard shall notify the Utilities Director within two business days after the
user has reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly
change in the next calendar month. If a regulated user does not notify the
Director of such anticipated change, the user shall meet the mass or
concentration effluent limits that were calculated on the original estimate of
the long-term average production rate.
      (4)   Where process wastewaters regulated by categorical pretreatment
standards are mixed with other wastewaters prior to discharge, the Utilities
Director may derive alternate discharge limits which shall apply to the
combined wastewater in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.6(e).
   (h)   State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges
shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements
and limitations or those in this or any other applicable chapter.
   (i)   City's Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to establish by
ordinance, or individual discharge permit, more stringent limitations or
requirements on discharges to the treatment works if deemed necessary to comply
with the objectives presented in Section
933.01.
   (j)   Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of potable, service or
process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the
limitations contained in categorical pretreatment standards, this chapter, or
any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the City or State.
   (k)   Batch Discharges. Concentrations or quantities of pollutants and flow
from Batch Discharges shall not exceed the limits established in the discharge
permit. Where the user is not an SIU, the concentration or quantities of
pollutants shall not exceed background domestic strength wastes.
   (l)   Accidental Discharge.
      (1)   Protection against accidental discharges required.  
         A.   Each industrial and commercial user shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by
this chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost
and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be approved by the City before construction of
the facility.
         B.   No industrial or commercial user who commences discharging to the
POTW after the effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to introduce
pollutants into the POTW until accidental discharge facilities and operating
procedures have been approved by the City. Review and approval of such plans
and operation procedures shall not relieve the user from the responsibility to
modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter.
      (2)   Notification. In the case of an accidental discharge or slug load
discharge of any material, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately
telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include
location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume and corrective
actions.
         Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall
submit to the Utilities Director a detailed written report describing the cause
of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relive the user of any expense,
loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to
the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such
notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability
which may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.
         A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employee whom to call in the event of an
accidental discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause
or suffer such an accidental discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedures.
      (3)   Accidental discharge prevention plan. The Utilities Director may
require submission of an accidental discharge (spill) prevention plan from any
user and shall give special consideration to requiring such plans from users
who have experienced one or more accidental discharges. The Utilities Director
shall evaluate, at least once every two years, whether each SIU discharging to
the POTW needs a plan to control accidental discharges and slugloads. If the
Utilities Director determines that a plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at
a minimum, the following elements:
         A.   Description of the discharge practices, including non-routine
discharges;
         B.   Description of stored chemicals;
         C.   Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug and
accidental discharges, including any discharge which would violate a
prohibition under 40 CFR Part 403.5(b), and procedures for follow-up written
notification within five days;
         D.   If necessary, procedures to prevent adverse impact from
accidental or slug discharges, including inspection and maintenance of storage
areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations,
control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment
structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic pollutants and/or
measures and equipment for emergency response.
   (m)   Operating Upsets. Any user which experiences an upset in operations
which places the user in a temporary state of noncompliance with this chapter
shall inform the Utilities Director thereof within twenty-four hours of first
awareness of the commencement of the upset. Where this information is given
orally, a written follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the user with the
City Utilities Director within five days. The report shall discuss the
following:
      (1)   Description of the upset, the cause thereof, and the upset's impact
on a user's compliance status.
      (2)   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur.
      (3)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other condition of noncompliance.
   The report must also demonstrate that the facility was being operated in a
prudent and workmanlike manner and was in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures.
   A documented and verified bona fide operation upset shall be an affirmative
defense to any enforcement action brought by the City against a user for
noncompliance with this chapter which arises out of violations alleged to have
occurred during the period of the upset.
   (n)   Bypasses.
      (1)   Bypasses prohibited. No industrial user shall "bypass" or
intentionally divert the waste stream from any portion of an industrial user's
treatment facility unless:
         A.   Bypass is unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or
severe property damage;
         B.   There are no feasible alternatives to the bypass, for example,
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, preventive
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal period of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         C.   The industrial user submitted the notices discussed below.
      (2)   Anticipated bypasses. The Utilities Director may only approve an
anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects, and if the Utilities
Director determines:
         A.   The bypass will not cause violation of pretreatment standards or
requirements or any provision of this chapter; and
         B.   The bypass is for essential maintenance to ensure the efficient
operation of pretreatment facilities.
      (3)   Notification. If an industrial user knows in advance of the need
for bypass, he shall submit a written notice to the Utilities Director at least
ten days before the date of the bypass, and shall not permit the bypass without
the Utilities Director's authorization.
         If an industrial user experiences an unanticipated bypass which
exceeds pretreatment standards or requirements, he shall verbally notify the
Director within twenty-four hours from the time he becomes aware of the bypass,
and shall submit within five days of verbal notification, a written report
describing the bypass event, and its cause; the bypass duration, including
exact times and dates; and if the bypass has not been corrected, the time it is
expected to continue and measures taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent its
recurrence. The Utilities Director may waive the written report if the verbal
report is received within twenty-four hours.
         (Ord. 106-94. Passed 10-3-94.)
   (o)   Grease and Oil Interceptors. For grease, oil and inorganic material
such as sand, grit, etc., interceptors shall be provided when they are required
by State health or building codes or when, in the opinion of the Utilities
Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes
containing floatable grease in excessive amount, or sand or other harmful
ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be required for private
living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and
capacity approved by the Utilities Director, and shall be located as to be
readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
   Where installed, all interceptors shall be maintained by the owner, at his
expense, in continuously efficient operation. The use of enzymes or emulsifying
detergents for the cleaning of grease interceptors is not permitted. The use of
bacteria injection systems is allowed at the discretion of the Utilities
Director. In maintaining these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible
for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured
material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal which
are subject to review by the Utilities Director. The manifests generated by the
disposal of captured material shall be submitted to the Utilities Director on a
quarterly basis. These records shall be maintained for a period of at least
three years. Any removal and hauling of the collected material must be
performed by currently licensed waste disposal operators. Before beginning to
discharge wastewater to the POTW, new sources shall install, have in operating
condition, start up, and maintain all necessary grease and oil interceptors.
   (p)   Pollutant Limitations for Nonsignificant Industrial Users.
Nonsignificant industrial users are required to obtain an individual wastewater
discharge permit for effluent quality equal to normal domestic strength waste.
Upon request, the Utilities Director may allow higher concentrations of BOD or
SS for which an “extra-strength” surcharge is paid by the user.
(Ord. 31-2020. Passed 5-18-20.)
   (q)   Notification of Substantial Change. Users shall notify the Utilities
Director a minimum of ten days prior to any substantial change in the volume or
character of their discharge or introduction of any new constituents, including
the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the user has submitted
initial notification under 40 CFR Part 403.12(p).
(Ord. 106-94. Passed 10-3-94.)
933.04 GENERAL PERMIT PROGRAM.
   (a)   “General Permit” means a permit issued by the City for users
conducting similar activities.
   (b)   General Permit Coverage. The Utilities Director may issue a general
permit without application to regulate certain nondomestic, nonindustrial users
having similar type discharges of pollutants. General permits may include the
following users:
      (1)   Commercial users that discharge wastewaters to the sanitary sewer
that emanate from the preparation, cooking, and dispensing of food, and from
the handling, storage and sale of food products.
      (2)   Other public authority users that discharge wastewaters to the
sanitary sewer that emanate from the preparation, cooking, and dispensing of
food.
   (c)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirement. The Utilities
Director may require any user authorized by a general permit to apply for and
obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit as described in Section
933.06. Cases where an individual permit may be required include any of the
following:
      (1)   The discharge is a significant contributor of pollution;
      (2)   The discharger is not in compliance with the conditions of the
general permit;
      (3)   The Utilities Director has revoked the general permit.
   (d)   Exclusion From General Permit Coverage. Any user authorized by a
general permit may request to be excluded from the coverage of the general
permit by applying for an individual wastewater discharge permit as described
in Section
933.06. The user shall submit an application with reasons supporting the
request. If an individual permit is issued by the Utilities Director, the
applicability of the general permit to the individual permittee is
automatically terminated on the effective date of the individual permit.
   (e)   Notification of General Permit Coverage.
      (1)   Each user authorized by a general permit shall submit a notice of
intent on forms specified by the Utilities Director to comply with the general
permit or a notice that the user wishes to receive an individual wastewater
discharge permit within ninety days of issuance of the general permit. For
discharges commenced after the issuance of the general permit a notice of
intent to comply with the general permit shall be submitted 30 days prior to
commencing discharge. Notice that the user wishes to receive an individual
permit shall be provided in the form of a completed permit application which
shall be submitted one hundred eighty days prior to commencing the discharge.
      (2)   Notices of intent shall be made only on forms approved by the City
and shall be considered and processed as an application for a permit.
      (3)   Such notice of intent shall contain:
         A.   Name, address, telephone number, contact person, and title of
owner or operator;
         B.   Description of the process generating the discharge, any existing
quantitative data describing the concentration of pollutants in the discharge,
and the volume to be discharged;
         C.   A map showing the location of the discharge and where it connects
to the public sewer.
         D.   Any other information deemed necessary by the Utilities Director.
      (4)   Notices of intent submitted to the Utilities Director pursuant to
this chapter shall be signed as specified in Section
933.06(a).
      (5)   The Utilities Director shall notify each affected entity in writing
that their discharge is authorized pursuant to the general permit. The
Utilities Director shall maintain a list of each entity authorized to discharge
under the general permit.
      (6)   Failure to submit a notice of intent or request an individual
wastewater discharge permit will result in an unpermitted discharge subject to
enforcement.
      (7)   A user excluded from a general permit solely because it already has
an individual permit may request that the individual permit be revoked and that
it be covered by the general permit. Upon revocation of the individual permit,
the general permit shall apply to the user.
   (f)   Criteria for Issuing and Renewing General Permit.
      (1)   The criteria for issuing and renewing general permits:
         A.   If, on the basis of all information available to the City, the
Utilities Director determines that:
            1.   The discharges authorized by the permit are more appropriately
authorized by a general permit than an individual wastewater discharge permit:
            2.   Adequate monitoring to obtain required pollutant discharge
information is provided.
      The Utilities Director shall issue a general permit or renewal for the
discharge.
      (2)   Permit duration. A general permit shall be effective for a fixed
term not to exceed five years.
   (g)   Modification of General Permit. The Utilities Director may modify
general permits. When a permit is modified, only the conditions subject to
modifications are reopened.
      (1)   Causes for modification. The following are causes for modification:
         A.   The Utilities Director has received new information. Permits may
be modified during their terms for this cause only if the information was not
available at the time of permit issuance and would have justified the
application of different permit conditions at the time of issuance.
         B.   The standards or regulations on which the permit was based have
been changed after the permit was issued.
         C.   To correct technical mistakes, such as errors in calculation or
mistaken interpretations of law made in determining permit conditions.
         D.   Minor modifications such as correcting typographical errors, or
requiring more frequent monitoring or reporting by the permittee.
            (Ord. 106-94. Passed 10-3-94.)
   (h)   Transfer of Nonresidential Discharge Permit Coverage.  Nonresidential
discharge permits are issued only to a specific user. Without the City’s
approval, no nonresidential discharge permit shall be reassigned, transferred,
or sold to a new owner, a new user, different premises or a new or changed
operation. A new owner shall notify the Utilities Director at least thirty days
before taking title. Any new or succeeding owner or user shall also comply with
the existing permit’s terms and conditions until he has submitted a complete
permit application and the City has issued him a new nonresidential discharge
permit.
(Ord. 31-2020. Passed 5-18-20.)
   (i)   Revocation of General Permits.
      (1)   The Utilities Director may revoke a general permit during its term
for cause, including but not limited to his determination that any applicable
laws, rules, regulations or permit terms or conditions have been violated.
      (2)   If the Utilities Director finds it necessary to revoke a general
permit, the Utilities Director shall send notice of the proposed revocation
which shall become effective ninety days from such notification.
      (3)   Upon notification from the Utilities Director regarding the
proposed revocation of a general permit, each user that was authorized by a
general permit which is revoked shall submit an application for an individual
wastewater discharge permit not later than ninety days after notification of
the proposed revocation of the general permit.
      (4)   Failure to submit an application for an individual permit not later
than ninety days after notification of the proposed revocation of the general
permit may result in an unpermitted discharge subject to enforcement.
         (Ord. 106-94. Passed 10-3-94.)
   (j)   General Permit Fees and Costs.
      (1)   All applicants for new General Permits shall pay a processing fee
of one hundred dollars ($100.00). Thereafter all permit holders will pay an
annual fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) due in March of each year for monitoring,
inspection and surveillance procedures. (Ord. 99-2008. Passed 12-15-08.)
      (2)   For existing facilities, the cost of installing a sampling port
shall be credited to future sewer bills at a rate of one-half the actual cost,
not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), and processing fees shall be
waived.
      (3)   All new facilities must install a sampling port at the time of any
grease trap installation. (Ord. 40-96. Passed 4-1-96.)
   
933.05 PRETREATMENT PROGRAM FEES.
   (a)   Costs incurred by the City for the implementation of the pretreatment
program established herein shall be recovered from the nonresidential users of
the City's POTW. The applicable charges or fees shall be set forth based on the
City's schedule of charges and fees.
   (b)   The City may adopt charges and fees which may include:
      (1)   Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the
pretreatment program;
      (2)   Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures;
      (3)   Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and
construction;
      (4)   Fees for permit applications;
      (5)   Fees for filing appeals;
      (6)   Fees for the City's consistent removal of pollutants otherwise
subject to categorical pretreatment standards;
      (7)   Surcharges to nonresidential users based on volume, excess strength
and other parameters deemed appropriate by the Utilities Director and
established as part of the user's wastewater discharge permit or the City's
schedule of fees; or
      (8)   Other fees the City deems necessary to implement the requirements
contained herein.
   (c)   These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this chapter and
are separate from all other fees chargeable by the City.

ensure compliance with this chapter.
      (5)   Discharge permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified
time period, not to exceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period less
than one year or may be stated to expire on a specific date.
   The user shall apply for permit reissuance by submitting a complete permit
application a minimum of 180 days prior to the expiration of the user's
existing permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to
modification or revocation by the City during the term of the permit as
limitations or requirements identified below are modified or other just cause
exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in his permit at
least thirty days prior to the effective date of the change. Any changes or new
conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for
compliance.
      (6)   Permit transfer. Discharge permits are issued to a specific user
for a specific operation. A discharge permit shall not be reassigned,
transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or
changed operation without the approval of the City. The new owner shall notify
the Utilities Director at least thirty days prior to the change of ownership.
Any new or succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and
conditions of the existing permit until he has submitted a complete permit
application and been issued a new discharge permit.
   (d)   Reporting Requirements for Permittee and Monitoring and Inspection.  
      (1)   Compliance date report. Within ninety days following the date for
final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or in the case of a new
source, following commencement of the discharge of wastewater into the POTW,
significant industrial users shall submit to the Utilities Director a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from
the regulated process(es) which are limited by pretreatment standards, and the
average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user's facility
which are limited by such pretreatment standards.
         In addition the report shall contain sufficient information on the
flow and constituents of nonregulated and/or dilution discharges to allow the
use of the combined waste stream formula. All sampling and analysis shall be
undertaken in accordance with the procedures established by USEPA at 40 CFR
Part 136.
This report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are being
met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional O&M and/or pretreatment
is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment
standards. This statement shall contain the same certification statement as the
discharge permit application, be signed by an authorized representative of the
user, and certified by a qualified professional.
      (2)   Periodic compliance reports.
         A.   Any user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, after
the compliance date of such categorical pretreatment standard, or, in the case
of a new source, after commencement of discharge into the POTW, shall submit to
the Utilities Director semiannually, unless required more frequently in the
categorical pretreatment standard or the user's discharge permit, a report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants discharged from each
regulated process(es) limited by the categorical pretreatment standard.
      In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which
during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow reported in the
discharge permit application. These periodic compliance reports shall be due in
the months of June and December and shall provide information for the preceding
six-month period. At the Utilities Director's discretion, and in consideration
of such factors as the local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles,
etc., the Director may agree to alter the months during which the periodic
compliance reports are to be submitted.
         B.   For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the Utilities Director in accordance with the procedures
above, these periodic compliance reports shall contain a reasonable measure of
the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharged per unit of production or other measure of operation, the periodic
compliance reports shall include the user's actual production during the
appropriate sampling period. If an equivalent concentration limit has been
calculated in accordance with a categorical pretreatment standard, this
adjusted concentration limit shall also be submitted in these reports.
         C.   Any significant noncategorical industrial user discharging to the
POTW shall submit to the Utilities Director at least once every six months (on
dates specified by the Utilities Director in the individual user's discharge
permit) a description of the nature, concentration and flow of the pollutants
required to be reported by the industrial user's discharge permit.
         D.   The periodic compliance reports shall be based upon data obtained
through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered
by the report, which data are representative of conditions occurring during the
reporting period. The frequency of sampling shall be prescribed in the
industrial user's permit where applicable, or otherwise by the Utilities
Director. This sampling and analysis may be conducted by the Utilities Director
in lieu of the industrial user. If the Utilities Director has collected all the
information required for the periodic compliance date report, the industrial
user may not be required to submit the reports.
         E.   The frequency of sampling shall be prescribed in the user's
discharge permit. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established in 40 CFR Part 136, and amendments thereto, or with any other test
procedures approved by the Administrator.
            Sampling shall be performed in accordance with techniques approved
by the Utilities Director. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include a sampling or
analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall
be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the USEPA
publication, "Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants," April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with
any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Utilities
Director.
         F.   If the industrial user's sampling data indicate a violation, the
user must:
            1.   Notify the Director within twenty-four hours of becoming aware
of the violation; and
            2.   Repeat the sampling and analysis and submit both sets of test
results within thirty days unless the City samples the user's discharge between
the industrial self-monitoring and receipt of the analytical results which
indicate a violation. The thirty-day period begins on the user's receipt of the
original sampling results.
         G.   The results of any additional industrial self-monitoring, that
is, monitoring not required by a categorical pretreatment standard or by the
user's discharge permit, conducted during the monitoring/reporting period, and
for which USEPA-approved procedures under 40 CFR Part 136 or approved
alternatives were used, must accompany the periodic compliance reports.
         H.   All periodic compliance reports shall contain the certification
statement required on the discharge permit application, and shall be signed by
an authorized representative of the user.
   (e)   Monitoring Facilities. The City shall require to be provided and
operated at the user's expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage
systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's
premises, but the City may, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles.
   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The monitoring
facility shall have an inspection and sampling manhole or structure with an
opening of no less than 24 inches in diameter and an internal diameter of no
less than 48 inches and shall contain such flow measuring, recording, and
sampling equipment necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter. The
facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the user's expense.
   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the City's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety days following
written notification by the City.
   (f)   Inspection and Sampling. The City shall inspect the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the objectives of this chapter are being met and to
determine noncompliance with all applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. Each significant industrial user shall be inspected by the City
at least once per year. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is
created or discharged shall allow the City or its representative ready access
at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of
their duties. The City and Ohio EPA shall have the right to set up on the
user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, compliance
monitoring and/or metering operations.
   Where the user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
   (g)   Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as
required to comply with this chapter and applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. Users shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards within the time limitations specified by the categorical pretreatment
standards or within three years of the effective date of the regulations,
whichever is sooner. New sources must meet the limits at the commencement of
discharge. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable
to the City shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. A
Permit to Install (PTI) application including detailed plans showing the
pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City
and the Ohio EPA on forms specified by Ohio EPA and/or the City for review and
shall be acceptable to the City and the Ohio EPA before construction of the
facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary
to produce an effluent acceptable to the City under the provisions of this
chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the City prior to the
user's initiation of the changes.
   Industrial users shall operate their wastewater treatment (pretreatment)
facilities at all times. All bypasses of pretreatment facilities are
prohibited, and all industrial users are subject to the penalties in this
chapter unless the provisions above for anticipated bypasses are met.
   (h)   Confidential Information. Information and data on a user obtained from
reports, questionnaires, permit application, permits and monitoring programs
and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the release of such
information, processes or methods of production is entitled to protection as
trade secrets or proprietary information of the user.
   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report
which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the
NPDES permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs;
provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by
the State or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information. The
portions of a report for which confidentiality is requested shall be separately
submitted and shall have each page marked "Trade Secret, Confidential".
   Information accepted by the City as confidential shall not be transmitted to
any governmental agency or to the general public by the City until and unless a
ten-day notification is given to the user.
   (i)   Industrial Records Retention. All users subject to this chapter shall
retain and preserve for not less than three years, any records, books,
documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence and any and all summaries
thereof, relating to monitoring, sampling and chemical analyses made by or on
the behalf of a user in connection with its discharge. All records which
pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative adjustment or any
other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the City pursuant to this
chapter shall be retained and preserved by the user until all enforcement
activities have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect to any and
all appeals have expired.
(Ord. 106-94. Passed 10-3-94.)
933.07 ENFORCEMENT.
   The Utilities Director shall have a duty to inform City Council of
enforcement activities by forwarding a copy of enforcement correspondence to
the Chairman of the Services Committee. Council's approval is not required
before the Utilities Director initiates enforcement.
   Administrative enforcement by the City shall not preclude the City from
seeking judicial enforcement remedies, nor shall it relieve the user of
liability under State or national administrative enforcement procedures or
judicial remedies.
   (a)   Emergency Suspension. The Utilities Director may suspend the
wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit when such
suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the Utilities Director, in order to
stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, or to
the environment; which causes or may cause interference to the POTW; or which
causes or may cause the City to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.
      (1)   Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
discharge. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with
the suspension order, the Utilities Director shall take such steps deemed
necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to any
individuals.
      (2)   A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the
causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence shall be submitted to the City within five days of the date of the
occurrence.
      (3)   The Utilities Director may reinstate the discharge permit and/or
sewer service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge or
may at any time initiate proceedings to permanently revoke wastewater treatment
service and/or the discharge permit.
   (b)   Revocation of Permit. Any user who violates the following conditions
of this chapter or a discharge permit, or applicable State and/or federal
regulation, is subject to having his permit revoked.
      (1)   Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of his discharge;
      (2)   Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
      (3)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purposes of inspection or monitoring; or
      (4)   Violation of conditions of his wastewater discharge permit.
Noncompliant users shall be notified of the proposed termination and given an
opportunity to request a show cause hearing.
   (c)   Notification of Violation (NOV). Whenever the City Utilities Director
finds that any user has violated or is violating this chapter, his wastewater
discharge permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained in
this chapter, the City Utilities Director may serve upon such person a written
notice stating the nature of the violation. Within ten days of the date of the
notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to
the Utilities Director by the user. Submission of this plan in no way relieves
the user of liability of any violation occurring before or after receipt of the
NOV. If the NOV is for exceedance of an effluent limit, the user shall, within
ten days following receipt of the NOV resample their discharge and submit the
results to the Utilities Director.
   (d)   Show Cause Hearing. The Utilities Director may order any user who
causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the POTW to show cause why
a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on
the user specifying the time and place of the hearing, the reasons why the
action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user
to show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
      The notice of the hearing shall be served personally, or by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing.
Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. Whether or not a
duly notified user appears as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be
pursued.
   (e)   Consent Orders. The Utilities Director is hereby empowered to enter
into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with the user responsible for the
noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the user
to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order.
   (f)   Compliance Order. When the Utilities Director finds that a user has
violated or continues to violate this chapter or a permit or order issued
hereunder, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service shall be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may also
contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of
pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices.
   (g)   Cease and Desist Orders. When the Utilities Director finds that a user
has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or order issued
hereunder, the Utilities Director may issue an order to cease and desist all
such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:
      (1)   Comply forthwith.
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge.
         (Ord. 106-94. Passed 10-3-94.)
   (h)   Administrative Fees. Notwithstanding any other section of this
chapter, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this chapter,
or permits or orders issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount of not less
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000)
per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be
deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the
user’s next scheduled sewer service charge and the Utilities Director shall
have such other collection remedies as he has to collect other service charges.
Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall constitute a lien against the
individual user’s property. Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a
request for the Utilities Director to reconsider the fine within ten days of
being notified of the fine. Where the Utilities Director believes a request has
merit, he shall convene a hearing on the matter within fifteen days of
receiving the request from the industrial user.
      (Ord. 98-98. Passed 9-21-98.)
933.08 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT.
   If any person discharges sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes into the
POTW contrary to the provisions of this chapter or any order or permit issued
hereunder, the Utilities Director, through the City's Law Director, may
commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the Common
Pleas Court for Licking County.
   (a)   Civil Penalties. Any user who has or continues to violate any
provision of this chapter, and the orders, rules, regulations and permits
issued hereunder shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) plus
damages incurred by the POTW for each offense. Each day on which a violation
shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct offense. Any
user who has or continues to violate any provision of this chapter or the
orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder shall be liable for all
reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, consulting fees, court costs,
court reporter fees and other related expenses incurred by the POTW to enforce
this chapter. The City may also recover special expenses including, but not
limited to, equipment rental, chemicals and labor necessary for the proper
operation and maintenance of all wastewater facilities.
   (b)   Criminal Penalties.
      (1)   General. Any user who willfully or knowingly violates any provision
of this chapter or any orders or permits issued hereunder shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of an unspecified crime, punishable by a fine not to
exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation or imprisonment for not more
than six months or both. Each day on which the violation occurs or continues
shall be deemed a separate offense. In the event of a second conviction, the
user shall be punishable as a repeat offender under State law.
      (2)   Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statements, representation or certification in any application, record, report,
plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this
chapter, or wastewater discharge permit, or who falsifies, tampers with or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
this chapter, shall upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than
five thousand dollars ($5,000) per violation or by imprisonment for not more
than six months, or by both. In the event of a second conviction, the user
shall be punishable as a repeat offender under State law.
   (c)   Injunctive Relief. Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate the provisions of this chapter or a permit or order issued hereunder,
the Utilities Director, through the Law Director, may petition the Court for
the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be
appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the user.
      (Ord. 106-94. Passed 10-3-94.)
933.09 PUBLICATION OF SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The Utilities Director shall publish, at least annually, in the Newark
Advocate a description of those users which are found to be in significant
noncompliance, as defined above, with any provisions of this chapter or any
permit or order issued hereunder during the period since the last publication.

933.13 ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE PLAN.
   (a)    Introduction. The City of Heath has an approved Pretreatment Program
that provides for the following:
      (1)    Control. Through Discharge Permit issuance, of non-domestic
pollutant discharges into the City's collection system;
      (2)    Inspection/monitoring. Through discharge sampling or site
visitation, of industry operations to determine compliance with predetermined
discharge criteria;
      (3)    Enforcement . Through legal authority, of the regulations
contained within the Program.
   The pretreatment regulations are contained in this Chapter
933 of the Codified Ordinances.
   To effectively administer its Pretreatment Program, the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency has required the City to devise an Enforcement Response Plan
(ERP) to plan, implement and evaluate its currently in-place enforcement
effort. The actions required of the City, as proposed in this document, are
intended to satisfy the OEPA requirement for the development of a Pretreatment
ERP.
   The ERP will describe a process for the collection and evaluation of
information on industrial user compliance, identification of non-compliance and
selection of an appropriate enforcement action with escalated follow-up actions
if necessary. The overall goal of the ERP is the resolution of noncompliance in
a uniform and timely manner that is consistent with the City's Pretreatment
Regulations.
   (b)    Enforcement Principles.
(1)    Industrial user characterization. The foundation of a compliance
tracking and enforcement system is a complete, up-to-date and accurate
compilation of relevant data on all significant industrial users. This
inventory will include as a minimum the name, location, standard industrial
classification code, reporting requirements, effluent limits, basis for the
limits (categorical standards, local limits, etc.), discharge volume and
composition, enforcement status and compliance dates. The industrial waste
survey, wherein users are identified and their wastewater discharge
characterized, will be used at regular frequencies as necessary to update the
inventory and account for variations in industrial production which affect the
discharge. Other sources of information, for instance, facility inspections,
water usage records and building permit applications will be used to supplement
the industrial waste surveys.
(2)    Industrial user data collection and handling. The data collection phase
creates a substantial flow of information that must be managed properly. For
each Industrial User, the City will first determine what data is required and
whether it has been submitted. If the information submitted is deficient or
late, the Industrial User will be notified and required to complete the
submission within a fixed time frame. The City will carefully plan the receipt,
processing and retainage of routine and special event data submissions to
ensure that they are available for decision-making regarding compliance
activities. Baseline monitoring reports (BMR), ninety-day compliance reports,
will be retained for at least three (3) years.
   In addition to collecting the data, the City will dispense certain
information to the Industrial User. For instance, the User will be notified of
any applicable pretreatment standards, its compliance status, any changes in
pretreatment requirements and results of inspections. Industrial Users will
also be informed of enforcement principles and the required responses to
noncompliance.
   The City has a plan for inspection which includes yearly site visitations,
effluent monitoring and facility inspections. The field investigations will be
used to verify compliance status as determined from Industrial User self-
monitoring. The City will have a predetermined procedure including a checklist
for these visitations for documentation purposes. The Industrial Users will be
advised at this time of any observed deficiencies found during the inspection.
   Discharge monitoring of all Industrial Users will take place at a minimum of
four (4) times per year, once during each quarter to obtain adequate
representation of industrial activities. On June 15 of each year, the City is
obligated to report to OEPA on its pretreatment activities including
monitoring, inspections and compliance status of all Industrial Users
      (3)    Compliance evaluation. The compliance evaluation process includes
a review of all available information obtained by the City and from the
Industrial Users self-monitoring to identify non-complying discharges. The
review will verify that all reports are submitted on time, include all required
data and are properly signed. The next level of review will be a comparison
between each discharge concentration reported and the limitation for that
parameter as required by the Industrial User's Respective Discharge Permit. Any
non-complying discharges will then be subject to an appropriate form of
enforcement action.
   (c)    Staff Allotment. The City has adequate staffing to carry out the
goals of the Program. This staff consists of inspectors/field personnel, a
laboratory technician, the Wastewater Plant Superintendent, and the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator. Under the Utilities Director, the Director of Law is
required to enforce the civil and criminal litigation of the Program as
directed by the Utilities Director. A division of labor has been devised to
implement the various facets of the ERP as outlined below.
   (d)    Function of Inspectors. Under the direct supervision of the
Wastewater Treatment Plant Superintendent, the field inspectors are in charge
of conducting all sampling and on-site inspections as required. These
individuals will prepare a sampling and inspection report to the
Superintendent, and discuss with him and the laboratory supervisor, the content
of the report as well as any observed violations of pretreatment regulations.
All results will be relayed to the Utilities Director.
   (e)    Function of Laboratory Technician. The laboratory technician will be
thoroughly familiar with the Program requirements, evaluate reports submitted
by the User, and the analysis of the samples collected by the City's inspector.
   (f)    Function of Wastewater Treatment Plant Superintendent. The Wastewater
Treatment Plant Superintendent is responsible for the day-to-day operation of
the POTW and its compliance with the terms and conditions of the NPDES permit.
   (g)    Function of the Pretreatment Coordinator. The Pretreatment
Coordinator is responsible for the management of the Pretreatment Program. This
individual will be the person who Industrial Users will seek out for program
guidance and assistance. The P.C. will work under the direction of the
Utilities Director. The P.C. will be responsible for the issuance of notices of
violation (NOV) and publishing the annual list of significant violators. He
will consult with the Utilities Director and the Law Director where necessary
to issue the following order, cease and desist, compliance, show-cause and
consent orders.
   (h)    Function of the Utilities Director. The Director or his agent will
provide administrative support on pretreatment matters and be present during
all show-cause hearings. The Director should be consulted on all matters
related to Administrative Orders and be directly responsible for the issuance
of service termination notices and the initiation of judicial proceedings.
   (i)    Function of Law Director. The Law Director will advise all personnel
connected with the program on enforcement matters and oversee the judicial
actions that are perceived necessary by the Utilities Director. The Law
Director will be consulted on all matters dealing with the interpretation of
the City Code and related enforcement actions.
   (j)    Enforcement Evaluation. Occurrences of noncompliance as determined
from the compliance evaluation process will be reviewed as to the type of
enforcement needed. The management of enforcement against violating industrial
users will be accomplished by developing an Enforcement Response Guide which
contains predetermined actions based on the nature of the violation and impact
on the sewage treatment system. These actions will vary but range from notices
of violation to potential termination of sewer service. The guide will embody
the following concepts:
      (1)   All violations of the Discharge Permit will be reviewed by the
appropriate City personnel;
      (2)    The City will notify the Industrial User whenever a violation is
identified;
      (3)    In general, the Industrial User may be asked to repeat an analysis
for an effluent parameter violation. If the result does not reveal
noncompliance, no further enforcement will be required;
      (4)    The City will receive in writing, an explanation of the violation
and a plan from the Industrial User to correct the violation within a specified
time frame;
      (5)    Persistent violations and/or an unacceptable explanation or
correction plan will be due cause for escalated enforcement proceedings.
   (k)    Responding to Noncompliance. Significant Noncompliance will set
priorities for enforcement and to report to OEPA on the performance of
Industrial Users. In general, instances of Significant Noncompliance are User
violations which meet at least one of the following criteria:
      (1)    Violations of wastewater discharge limits. 
         A.   Chronic violations as defined as sixty-six percent or more of the
measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit in a
six-month period (any magnitude of exceedance).
         B.   Technical Review Criteria violations as defined in the ordinance
as defined as thirty-three percent (33%) or more of the measurements exceed the
same daily maximum limit or the same average limit by more than the TRC in a
six-month period.
There are two groups of TRCS:
Group I for conventional pollutants
(BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease)    TRC = 1. 4
Group II for all other pollutants    TRC = 1. 2
         C.   Interference and Passthrough phenomena; or
         D.   Damage to the collection system and/or endangerment of the POTW
workers; or
         E.   Public health endangerment; or
      (2)    Violations of compliance schedule milestones;
      (3)    Failure to provide reports (i.e., compliance schedules, self-
monitoring data, baseline monitoring, ninety-day compliance and periodic
reports) within thirty (30) days of the due date;
      (4)    Failure to accurately report noncompliance;
      (5)    Any other violation or combination thereof the City believes to be
significant.
   The City Code also defines the criteria, which subject the violator to
public scrutiny through local newspaper publication, in general, the User's
name shall be published annually if they meet at least one of the following:
      (1)    A violation which remains uncorrected forty-five days after
notification of noncompliance;
      (2)    A violation that is part of a pattern of noncompliance over a
twelve (12) month period;
      (3)    A violation involving a failure to accurately report
noncompliance;
      (4)    A violation that resulted in the City exercising emergency
authority during the twelve (12) previous months.
   (l)    Enforcement Response Guide. The following enforcement response guide
covers the responses that relate to the nature and severity of the violation
and the overall degree of noncompliance. The guide is essentially a modified
form of that presented in "Pretreatment Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement
Guidance", Office of Water Enforcement and Permits, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, September 1986. A range of enforcement responses has been
prescribed for a number of predetermined violations. Violations that occur but
which are not contained in the Guide will be dealt with on a case-by-case
basis.
   The determination of the level of response that is necessary for a given
violation will consider the degree of variance from the pretreatment or local
standard, time duration of the violation and previous violations. Obviously,
the factors of equality, fairness and consistency are also important. One other
factor, timeliness, is critical to expedite noncompliance makers. The City
understands that within five (5) days of the identification of the violation, a
response should be formulated and an action taken; full documentation will be
mandatory. The User will then have fourteen (14) days in which to reply. If
noncompliance continues beyond a predetermined time period, escalated
enforcement action will be taken. Table I presents the Enforcement Response
Guide for the City of Heath. The Table presents four (4) different categories
of noncompliance, each with its own suggested response range.

   (m)    Response Levels. As noted in the Enforcement Response Guide, there
are three (3) basic levels of response - no response, informal response, formal
actions.
   Informal responses will range from inspections, phone calls or NOVs written
to the Industrial User. Formal enforcement responses will be one of the
following: Show cause hearing, Compliance order, Consent order, monetary
penalties or service suspension/termination.
   Monetary penalties will also be used as part of the enforcement program.
USEPA has set forth four (4) goals that will be reviewed before penalties are
assessed:
      (1)    Recover the cost to the City of the noncompliance.
      (2)    Size penalty to deter future incidences of noncompliance.
      (3)    Maintain a program of fairness, equality and consistency.
      (4)    Provide a logical and systematic basis for penalty calculation.
   If an Industrial User appears to be attempting to comply "in good faith"
with the pretreatment requirements, the City will assume a more cooperative
attitude with this type of User. If inadequate operating practices are
determined to be the cause, the City will seek specific commitments to improve
the operating practices.
   More aggressive enforcement actions will be taken against Industrial Users
that frequently exceed pretreatment requirements as opposed to those that
report isolated violations. In any case, if cooperation is not achieved,
escalated forms of enforcement will be taken to attain compliance in a timely
fashion.
   (n)    Record Keeping/Reporting. The City will maintain records of
pretreatment program activities for not less than three (3) years. These
records will consist of industrial user self- monitoring reports, OEPA
inspections, sampling of Industrial Users City personnel and records of any
enforcement actions taken. All violations will be identified and a record made
of the type of response taken.
   Most if not all of the records can and may be logged into a computerized
database to better manage the whole pretreatment process. Computerized
pretreatment data will then make it easier to produce an annual report once all
the data forms have been input and all necessary form linkages are established.
   (o)    Notwithstanding any other part of this section, any user who is found
to have violated any provision of this section, or permits and orders issued
hereunder shall be fined in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars
($1,000) per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue
shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be
added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge and the Utilities
Director shall have such other collection remedies as he has to collect other
service charges. Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall constitute a lien
against the individual user's property. Industrial users desiring to dispute
such fines may file a request for the Utilities Director to reconsider the fine
within ten (10) days of being notified of the fine. Where the Utilities
Director believes a request has merit, he shall convene a hearing on the matter
within fifteen (15) days of receiving the request from the industrial user.

D =   Monthly charge for debt retirement (cost per 100 cubic feet).
E =   City's annual debt payment for wastewater treatment plant and collection
system improvements.
F =   Total annual metered flow through residential, commercial, industrial,
governmental and institutional flow meters (100 cubic feet).
   (c)   Additional Charges. Additional charges will be levied against users
discharging wastewater in excess of normal domestic waste strength. Additional
charges for extra-strength wastewater shall be based on the following
equations:
 
(1)   BOD.
   G =    I
       J       WHERE:
   G =   Average O, M & R cost for BOD removal.
   H =   Annual O, M & R cost of wastewater treatment plant only.
   I =   0.30 x H = Annual O, M & R cost associated with BOD removal.
   J =   Total pounds of BOD entering the wastewater treatment plant annually.
   The BOD surcharge will be based on the users total monthly discharge in excess of
300 mg/l as defined for normal strength domestic waste. BOD surcharge will include
monitoring and surveillance charges.
(2)   Suspended Solids.
   K =    L
       M      WHERE:
   K =   Average O, M & R cost for suspended solids removal.
   H =   Annual O, M & R cost of wastewater treatment plant only.
   L =   0.35 x H = annual O, M & R cost associated with suspended solids removal.
   M =   Total pounds of suspended solids entering the treatment plant annually.
The SS surcharge will be based on the users total monthly discharge in excess
of 250 mg/l as defined for normal strength domestic waste. SS surcharge will
include monitoring and surveillance charges.

(Ord. 98-2007. Passed 11-19-07.)
945.05 LOCATION, RELOCATION AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES.
   (a)    Location of Facilities. All facilities shall be Constructed,
Reconstructed, installed and located in accordance with the following terms and
conditions:
      (1)    Facilities shall be installed within an existing compatible
underground duct or conduit whenever Excess Capacity exists within such
Facility.
      (2)    A Service Provider with permission to install Overhead Facilities
shall install its Facilities on pole attachments to existing utility poles
only, and then only of Surplus Space is available.
      (3)    Whenever the existing electric, cable, telecommunications and
other similar Facilities are located underground in a Public Right-of-Way, a
Service Provider with permission to Occupy the same Public Right-of-Way with
the electric, cable, telecommunications or other similar Facilities, must also
locate its Facilities underground.
      (4)    Except for Overhead Facilities as provided herein, no Facilities
shall be located above ground in a Public Right-of-Way without the express
written permission of the Director.
      (5)    The City reserves the right to require a Service Provider to
provide Excess Capacity in the Public Right-of-Way at the time of Construction,
Reconstruction, installation, location or relocation of Facilities.
   (b)    Excess Capacity. To reduce Excavation in the Public Right-of-Way, it
is the City's goal to encourage Service Providers to share occupancy of
underground conduit as well as to construct, whenever possible, excess conduit
capacity for occupancy of future Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way.
Therefore, if a Service Provider is constructing underground conduit in the
Public Right-of-Way for its own Facilities, and the City reasonably determines
such construction is in an area in which other Service Providers would likely
construct Facilities in the future, the City may require the Service Provider
to construct the conduit in the Public Right-of-Way with Excess Capacity in the
Public Right-of-Way, provided the Service Provider shall be reimbursed for the
use of the Excess Capacity by another Service Provider. The Service Provider
may charge a reasonable market lease rate for occupancy of the additional
conduit space as reimbursement.
   (c)    City Owned Conduit. If the City owns or leases conduit in the path of
a Service Provider's proposed Facilities, and provided it is technologically
feasible for the Service Provider's Facilities to Occupy the conduit owned or
leased by the City, the Service Provider shall be required to Occupy the
conduit owned or leased by the City in order to reduce the necessity to
Excavate the Public Right-of-Way. The Service Provider shall pay to the City a
fee for such Occupancy which shall be the cost the Service Provider would have
expended to construct its own conduit, as certified by the Service Provider's
engineer and approved by the City Engineer. The City and the Service Provider
may agree to amortize the fee through annual payments to the City.
   (d)    Relocation or Removal of Facilities. Within thirty (30) days
following written notice from the City, a Service Provider shall, at its own
expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the
position of any Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way whenever the City shall
have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration is
reasonably necessary for:
      (1)    The Construction, Reconstruction, repair, maintenance or
installation of any City or other public improvement in or upon the Public
Right-of-Way.
       (2)    The operations of the City or other governmental entity in or
upon the Public Right-of-Way.
   (e)    Removal of Unauthorized Facilities. Within thirty (30) days following
written notice from the City, any Service Provider or other person that owns,
controls or maintains any unauthorized System, Facility or related
appurtenances in the Public Right-of-Way shall, at its own expense, remove
those facilities or appurtenances from the Public Right-of-Way of the City or
shall arrange to sell the System, Facilities or appurtenances to the City.
After the thirty (30) days have expired, the City may remove the Facilities or
appurtenances from the Public Right-of-Way at the other party's expense. A
system is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances:
      (1)    Upon revocation of the Service Provider's consent to Occupy or Use
the Public Right-of-Way;
      (2)    If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained without the consent to do so, except
as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
      (3)    Upon abandonment of a Facility in the Public Right-of-Way of the
City, with the exception of underground facilities abandoned in a manner
authorized and approved by the City;
      (4)    If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of-Way was performed, without prior issuance of a required Construction
Permit, except as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
      (5)    If the System or Facility was Constructed, Reconstructed,
installed, operated, located or maintained, or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of-Way was performed, at a location not permitted pursuant to the City's
consent to occupy or Use the Public Right-of-Way or Construction Permit;
      (6)    If the Service Provider fails to comply with the Registration
requirements of Section
945.03 of this Chapter.
   (f)    Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. The City retains the
right and privilege to cut or move any Facilities, or stop work on any
Construction, Reconstruction, installation, operation or Excavation, located in
the Public Right-of-Way of the City, as the City may determine to be necessary,
appropriate or useful in response to any need to protect the public health,
safety or welfare; except to the extent that the City's actions would cause a
dangerous or potentially dangerous situation.

Obstruction of, a Public Right-of-Way or closing of a Public Street.
      (2)    For Routine Maintenance and New Service Orders that require the
Service Provider to cause a Lane Obstruction in a Public Street for more than
four (4) hours, the Service Provider shall provide the City with forty-eight
(48) hours advance notice prior to commencing the Routine Maintenance or New
Service Order, and shall submit a drawing showing the planned traffic
maintenance and indicating how the Service Provider will meet all requirements
of ODOT's Manual of Traffic Control Devices or other applicable ODOT
regulations.
   (c)    Emergency Work. In the event of the need for any unexpected repair or
Emergency work, a Service Provider may commence such Emergency response work as
required under the circumstances, provided that for Emergency work that
requires Excavation of a Public Right-of-Way or Lane Obstruction or closing of

other information with regard to the lot and neighboring lots as may be
necessary to determine and provide for the enforcement of this Zoning
Ordinance. One copy of such plans shall have been approved by the Zoning
Inspector, together with such zoning certificate as may be granted. All

be built shall be based on actual survey.
   (b)   The lot and the location of the building thereon shall be staked out
on the ground before construction is started.
   (c)   Certificate of Health Officer. In every case where the lot is not
provided and is not proposed to be provided with public water supply and/or the
disposal of sanitary wastes by means of public sewers, the application shall be
accompanied by a certificate of approval by the Health Officer of the City of
the proposed method of water supply and/or disposal of sanitary wastes.
(Ord. 21-67. Passed 12-4-67.)
1125.03 ZONING CERTIFICATE.
   (a)   Uses Prohibited Without Zoning Certificate. No owner, lessee or tenant
shall use or permit the use of any structure, building or land or part thereof,
hereafter created, erected, changed, converted or enlarged, wholly or partly,
until a zoning certificate, which may be a part of the building permit, shall
have been issued by the Zoning Inspector. Such zoning certificate shall show
that such building or premises or a part thereof, and the proposed use thereof,
are in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. It shall be the
duty of the Zoning Inspector to issue a zoning certificate, provided he is
satisfied that the structure, building or premises, and the proposed use
thereof, and the proposed methods of water supply and disposal of sanitary
wastes conform with all the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Certificate of Occupancy. No owner, lessee or tenant shall occupy any
structure, building or land, or part thereof, hereafter erected, created,
changed, converted or enlarged unless a certificate of occupancy shall have
been issued by the Zoning Inspector after inspection. Such certificate of
occupancy shall show and certify that such building, structure or premises has
been constructed, altered or improved in compliance with the provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance, the Building Code and all other applicable codes or
ordinances and all conditions and requirements, if any stipulated by the Board
of Zoning and Building Appeals or other proper authority.
   (c)   Excavating Permit. No permit for excavation or construction shall be
issued by the Zoning Inspector unless the plans, specifications and the
intended use conform to the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 21-67. Passed 12-4-67.)
   (d)   Certificate Time Limitations. All construction performed pursuant to a
zoning certificate granted hereunder must be commenced within six months of the

1125.04 INSPECTOR TO ACT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS.
   The Zoning Inspector shall act upon all such applications on which he is
authorized to act by the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance within thirty days
after they are filed in full compliance with all the applicable requirements.
He shall either issue a zoning certificate within such thirty days or shall
notify the applicant in writing of his refusal of such certificate and the
reasons therefor. Failure to notify the applicant in case of such refusal with
such thirty days shall entitle the applicant to the zoning certificate, unless
the applicant consents to an extension of time.
(Ord. 21-67. Passed 12-4-67.)
1125.05 FEES.
   Fees shall be charged in accordance with orders and directions of Council.
(Ord. 21-67. Passed 12-4-67.)
1125.06 CONSTRUCTION ADMINISTRATION DEPOSIT.
   (a)   A Construction Administration Deposit shall be made with the Zoning
Department at the time the plan review application is submitted for all
residential, commercial, or industrial projects for which the project owner:
      (1)   Cannot provide plans that are stamped by an architect, engineer, or
surveyor that is registered within the State of Ohio; or
      (2)   Has not employed a professional contractor for the construction of
the proposed project; or
      (3)   Has not hired a professional architect, engineer, or surveyor
licensed by the State of Ohio or a professional contractor as the project
manager.
   Project owners are strongly discouraged from acting as their own designer,
contractor, or project manager in lieu of a recognized design professional.
   (b)   The Construction Administration Deposit shall be equal to 1% of the
total project cost, as identified on the zoning permit, but not less than
$1,500.00. The Construction Administration Deposit shall not exceed $2,500 for
residential projects and $6,000 on commercial and industrial projects.
   (c)   The Chief of the Division of Building and Zoning or his designee shall
have the authority to waive the Construction Administration Deposit for small
projects such as decks, sheds, carports, etc. that clearly demonstrate no
conflict with any of the City’s rules and regulations.
   (d)   The Construction Administration Deposit shall be used to cover all
costs incurred by the City resulting from additional inspections or third-party
services that are required, due to no fault of the City, during the
construction phase of a project. The Construction Administration Deposit will
not cover costs incurred by the City during the Plan Review process. A fee
schedule is already in place to recoup those costs.
   (e)   Whatever amount of the Deposit is not used at the end of the
construction phase of the project will be returned to the project owner. In the
event the initial Construction Administration Deposit is spent in its entirety
and additional costs are incurred by the City, the project owner shall be
responsible for reimbursing the City for those costs upon receipt of final
invoice. (Ord. 62-2017. Passed 9-5-17.)
1125.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   No person shall locate, erect, construct, reconstruct, enlarge,
change, maintain or use any building or land in violation of any of the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, or any amendment or supplement thereto
adopted by Council. Whoever violates any provision of this Zoning Ordinance, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor
and shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). Each and every
day during which such illegal location, erection, construction, reconstruction,
enlargement, change, maintenance or use continues shall be deemed to be a
separate offense.
   (b)   In case any building is or is proposed to be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, changed, maintained or used, or any land
is or is proposed to be used in violation of this Zoning Ordinance or any
amendment or supplement thereto, Council, the City Solicitor or an Assistant
City Solicitor, the Chief of the Division of Building and Zoning Inspection, or
any adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be specially damaged by
such violation, may in addition to other remedies provided by law, institute
appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful location, erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use; to
restrain, correct or abate such violation; to prevent the occupancy of such
building, structure or land; or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business
or use in or about such premises.

board or bureau. Such applications shall be filed with the Zoning Inspector who

Inspector shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
   (d)   Secretary's Report on Appeals. The secretary shall investigate the
appeal and submit a report thereon, together with his recommendations, to the
Board.
   (e)   Hearings. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the
application or appeal and shall give written notice of such hearing to the
parties in interest, including all property owners within and contiguous to and
directly across the street from such parcel or parcels to the addresses of such
owners appearing on the County Auditor's current tax list or the Treasurer's
mailing list and to such other lists as may be required by Council. Reference
is hereby especially made to Section
 4.13 of the City Charter. Each application or appeal shall be accompanied by a
check, payable to the Treasurer of the City, or a cash payment, sufficient in
amount to cover the cost of publishing and/or posting, and mailing the notices
of the hearing or hearings, but in no event shall it be less than fifteen
dollars ($15.00). At the hearing, any party may appear in person or be
represented by agent or attorney.
   (f)   Appeal from Decision of the Board. Any person or persons, jointly or
severally aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Zoning and Building
Appeals, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the City may present to
the Court of Common Pleas of Licking County a petition, duly verified, setting
forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the
grounds of the illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the Court within
thirty days after the filing of the decision in the office of the Board of
Zoning and Building Appeals. Any such case shall be heard and determined by the

      (2)   A decision of the Board shall not become final until the expiration
of five days from the date such decision is made, unless the Zoning Inspector
certifies to the Board that such decision is necessary for the preservation of
property or personal rights and shall so certify on the record.
   (h)   Stay of Proceedings. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from unless the Zoning Inspector certified
to the Board after notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by
reasons of acts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
or by the Court of Common Pleas of Licking County on application, on notice to
the Zoning Inspector or by judicial proceedings, and on due cause shown.
(Ord. 21-67. Passed 12-4-67.)
1127.06 POWERS OF THE BOARD OF ZONING AND BUILDING APPEALS.
   The Board of Zoning and Building Appeals shall have the powers granted in
Sections
1127.06 through
1127.09 and their respective subparagraphs as follows:
   (a)   Conditional Uses, Special Exceptions and Interpretation of Zoning Map.
The Board shall have the power to hear and decide, in accordance with the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, applications, filed as hereinbefore
provided, for conditional uses, special exceptions or for interpretation of the
Zoning Map, or for decisions upon other special questions upon which the Board
is authorized to pass by this Zoning Ordinance. In considering an application
for a conditional use, a special exception or interpretation of the Zoning Map,
the Board shall give due regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent
uses and structures; and in authorizing a conditional use or special exception,
the Board may impose such requirements and conditions with respect to location,
construction, maintenance and operation, in addition to those expressly
stipulated in this Zoning Ordinance for the particular conditional use or
special exception-as the Board may deem necessary for the protection of
adjacent properties and the public interest.
   (b)   Other Conditional Uses. In addition to permitting the conditional uses
and special exceptions hereinbefore specified, the Board shall have the power
to permit the following conditional uses and special exceptions:
      (1)   Nonconforming uses; substitutions. The substitution of a
nonconforming use existing at the time of enactment of this Zoning Ordinance,
by another nonconforming use, if no structural alterations, except those
required by law or resolution, are made; provided, however, that in any R
District no change shall be authorized by the Board to any use which is not a
principal permitted or conditional use in any R District, and in B District no
change shall be authorized to any use which is not a principal permitted or
conditional use in any B District.
      (2)   Conditional industrial uses. Permitting in such parts of any M-
2 Districts as are more than 600 feet distant from any R District, and more
than 200 feet from every other district, any of the industries or uses listed
in the M-2 District. In authorizing such use, the Board may require the
installation, operation and maintenance of such devices or such methods of
operation as may, in the opinion of the Board, be reasonably required to
prevent or reduce fumes, gas, dust, smoke, odor, water-carried waste, noise,
vibration or similar objectionable features, and may impose such conditions
regarding the extent of open spaces between such industries or uses and
surrounding properties as will tend to prevent or reduce the harm or nuisance
which might otherwise result from the proposed use of surrounding properties
and neighborhoods.
      (3)   Temporary structures and uses. The Board may authorize the
temporary use of a structure or premise in any district for a purpose or use
that does not conform to the regulations prescribed elsewhere in this Zoning
Ordinance for the district in which it is located, provided that such use is of
a temporary nature and does not involve the erection of a substantial
structure. A zoning certificate for such use shall be granted in the form of a
temporary and revocable permit, for not more than a twelve month period,
subject to such conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety,
convenience and general welfare.
         (Ord. 21-67. Passed 12-4-67.)
1127.07 INTERPRETATION OF ZONING ORDINANCE AND MAP.
   Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as recorded,
differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the Zoning Map, the Board,
after notice to the owners of the property and after public hearing, shall
interpret the Map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of this
Zoning Ordinance. In case of any questions as to the location of any boundary
line between zoning districts or where there is uncertainty as to the meaning
and intent of a textual provision of this Zoning Ordinance, a request for
interpretation of the Zoning Map or the textual provision in question may be
made to the Board and a determination shall be made by the Board.
(Ord. 21-67. Passed 12-4-67.)
1127.08 ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW AND VARIANCES.
   The Board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals, filed as
hereinbefore provided, where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error
in any order, requirement, decision, determination, grant or refusal made by
the Zoning Inspector or other administrative official in the enforcement and
interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (a)   Variances; Literal Enforcement Would Create Undue Hardship. The Board
shall have the power to authorize upon appeal in specific cases, filed as
hereinbefore provided such variances from the terms, provisions or requirements
of this Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest;
provided, however, that such variances shall be granted only in such cases
where, owing to special and unusual conditions pertaining to a specific piece
of property, the literal enforcement of the provisions or requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance would result in practical difficulty or undue hardship, so
that the spirit of the Zoning Ordinance shall be upheld, public safety and
welfare secured and substantial justice done.
   (b)   Variances; Conditions Prevailing. Where, by reason of the exceptional
narrowness, shallowness or unusual shape of a specific piece of property on the
effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, or by reason of exceptional
topographic conditions, or other extraordinary situation or condition of such
piece of property, or of the use or development of property immediately
adjoining the piece of property in question, the literal enforcement of the
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance would involve practical difficulty or
would cause unnecessary hardship-unnecessary to carry out the spirit and
purpose of this Zoning Ordinance-the Board shall have the power to authorize a
variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance, so as to relieve such
hardship. In authorizing a variance, the Board may attach thereto such
conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed
structure or use as it may deem necessary in the interest of the furtherance of
the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance and in the public interest. In authorizing
a variance, with attached conditions, the Board shall require such evidence and
guarantee or bond as it may deem to be necessary, to enforce compliance with
the conditions attached.
   (c)   Findings of the Board. No such variance of the provisions or
requirements of this Zoning Ordinance shall be authorized by the Board unless
the Board finds, beyond reasonable doubt, that all the following facts and
conditions exist:
      (1)   Exceptional circumstances. That there are exceptional or
extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the property in question
or to the intended use of the property, that do not apply generally to other
properties or classes of uses in the same zoning district.
      (2)   Preservation of property rights. That such variance is necessary
for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by
other properties in the same zoning district and in the same vicinity.
      (3)   Absence of detriment. That the authorizing of such variance will
not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property, and will not materially
impair the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance of the public interest.
   (d)   Not of General Nature. No grant of a variance shall be authorized
unless the Board specifically finds that the condition or situation of the
specific piece of property, or the intended use of such property, for which
variance is sought is not of so general or recurrent a nature as to make
reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such
condition or situation.
   (e)   Board May Reverse Orders, Etc. In exercising its power, the Board may,
in conformity with the provisions of statute and of this Zoning Ordinance,
reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement,
decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement,
decision or determination as ought to be made and to that end shall have all
powers of the office from whom the appeal is taken.
      (Ord. 21-67. Passed 12-4-67.)
1127.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS; PROCEDURE.
   The Board shall have the power to authorize, upon application in specific
cases, filed as hereinafter provided, issuance of a zoning certificate for uses
that are subject to performance standards' procedure under Chapters
1177 and
1181 of the Zoning Ordinance, as provided in the following:
   (a)   Application. An application for a zoning certificate for a use subject
to performance standards shall be submitted in duplicate on a form prescribed
by the Board. The applicant shall also submit in duplicate a plan of the
proposed construction or development-including a description of the proposed
machinery, processes and products, and specifications for the mechanisms and
techniques to be used in restricting the emission of dangerous and
objectionable elements as set forth in chapter
1181  in accordance with rules prescribed by the Board specifying the type of
information required in such plans and specifications. The fee for such
application shall include the cost of the special reports that may be required
to process it, as set forth in subsection (b) hereof.
   (b)   Report by Specialists. If in its opinion, the proposed use may cause
the emission of dangerous or objectionable elements, the Board may refer the
application to one or more specialists qualified to advise as to whether a
proposed use will conform to the applicable performance standards specified in
Chapter
1181  for investigation and report. Such consultant or consultants shall report
as promptly as possible after his or their receipt of such application. A copy
of such report shall be promptly furnished to the applicant.
   (c)   Review by Board. Within thirty days after the Board has received the
aforesaid application, or the aforesaid report, or within such further period
as agreed to by the applicant, the Board shall decide whether the proposed use
will conform to the applicable performance standards, and on such basic shall
authorize or refuse to authorize issuance of a zoning certificate or require a
modification of the proposed plan of construction, or specifications, proposed
equipment or operation. Any zoning certificate so authorized and issued shall
be conditioned upon, among other things, the following:
      (1)   That the applicant's buildings and installations when completed
will conform in operation to the applicable performance standards; and
      (2)   That the applicant will pay the fees for services of the expert
consultant or consultants deemed reasonable and necessary by the Board to
advise the Board as to whether or not the applicant's completed buildings and
installation in operation will meet such applicable performance standards.
   (d)   Continued Enforcement. The Zoning Inspector shall investigate any
purported violation of performance standards and, if there is reasonable
grounds for the same, shall notify the Board of the occurrence or existence of
a probable violation thereof. The Board shall investigate the alleged
violation, and for such investigation shall employ qualified experts. The
services of any qualified expert employed by the Board to advise in
establishing a violation shall be paid by the violator if such violation is
established, otherwise by the City.

or property as shown on the Zoning Map, and for regulation amendments, shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission, at its public office, upon such forms,

for that purpose by the Commission, so as to assure the fullest practicable
presentation of facts for the permanent record. Such data shall include in any
event a plat or map drawn to a scale of not less than 100 feet to the inch
showing the land in question, its location, the length and location of each
boundary thereof, the location of existing use of all buildings and the
principal use of all properties within 300 feet of such land. Each application
shall be verified by at least one of the owners or lessees of property within
the area proposed to be reclassified attesting to the truth and correctness of
all facts and information presented with the application. Applications for
amendments or district changes initiated by the Commission itself shall be
accompanied by its own motion pertaining to such proposed amendment.
   (b)   Any person or persons desiring a change in the zoning classification
of property shall file with the application for such change a statement giving
the names and addresses of the owners of all properties lying with 300 feet of
any part of the exterior boundaries of the premises the zoning classification
of which is proposed to be changed.

1129.03 COMMISSION HEARING; NOTICE.
   (a)   Before submitting its recommendations to Council, the Planning
Commission may, by a majority vote of its total membership, hold at least one
public hearing thereon, notice of which shall be given by one publication in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City at least ten days before the date
of such hearing.
   (b)   Following such hearing and review the Commission may recommend that
the application be granted as requested, or it may recommend a modification of
the zoning amendment requested in the application, or it may recommend that the
application be denied. These recommendations shall then be certified to
Council.

1129.04 COUNCIL HEARING.
   (a)   After receiving from the Commission the certificate of such
recommendations on the proposed amendment or supplement, and before adoption of
such amendment, Council shall hold a public hearing thereon, at least fifteen
days' notice of the time and place of which shall be given by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City. If the proposed ordinance
amendment intends to rezone or redistrict ten or less parcels of land, as
listed in the tax duplicate, written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by
the Clerk of Council, by first class mail, at least fifteen days before the
date of the public hearing to the owners of property within and contiguous to
and directly across the street from such parcel or parcels, to the addresses of
such owners appearing on the County Auditor's current tax list or the
Treasurer's mailing list and to such other lists as may be required by Council.
The failure of deliver of such notice shall not invalidate any such ordinance
or resolution.
   (b)   Following such hearing and after reviewing the recommendations of the
Commission thereon, Council shall consider such recommendations and vote on the
passage of the proposed amendment to the text of the Zoning Ordinance or the
Zoning Map. Council may overrule the recommendations of the Commission by two-
thirds vote of the full membership of Council.
(Ord. 21-67. Passed 12-4-67.)
1129.05 EFFECT ON ZONING CERTIFICATE, BUILDING PERMIT.

Zoning Map from a less restricted district to a more restricted district
classification, as evidenced by resolution of record, no zoning certificate or
building permit shall be issued within sixty days from the date of such
resolution which would authorize the construction of a building or the
establishment of a use which would become nonconforming under the contemplated
redistricting plan.

CHAPTER 1130
Establishing Overlay Zoning Districts
1130.01   Significance.
1130.02   Designation criteria.
1130.03   Application.
1130.04   The description and process.
1130.01 SIGNIFICANCE.
   Overlay zoning districts address special siting, use and compatibility
issues which require unique development regulations in addition to those of the
underlying zoning districts. Whenever regulations in an overlay zoning district
impose greater standards than those required by the base zoning district, the
more restrictive standards apply. The zoning code would authorize the
establishment of zoning overlay districts, however separate ordinances are
required to designate each district. (Ord. 28-2017. Passed 10-2-17.)
1130.02 DESIGNATION CRITERIA.
   The specific purposes of the proposed overlay district must be identified
and contrasted to the existing base zoning requirements, to delineate clearly
the special requirements of the overlay district from the base requirements.
Development or redevelopment standards must be delineated and uniformly
applied. (Ord. 28-2017. Passed 10-2-17.)
1130.03  APPLICATION.
   The zoning designations of properties located within an overlay district
shall consist of the regular base zone classifications, with the overlay
district classification added as a suffix. As an example, if a residential
parcel is zoned “R-1" and it also is located within a Historic Monument (HM)
overlay district, it would be classified as “R-1" (HM). Therein, the parcel
would be bound by the greater standards of the special overlay district.
(Ord. 28-2017. Passed 10-2-17.)
1130.04 THE DESCRIPTION AND PROCESS.
   (a)   The City shall undertake land use, surveys or other background studies
necessary to designate an overlay district. The boundaries must be clearly
identified. All property owners within the proposed overlay district and those
in immediately adjacent areas shall be afforded the opportunity to comment and
otherwise pass along their views on the proposed regulations.
   (b)   The proposed new ordinance is prepared as a draft and introduced to
City Council for initial review. It would then be referred to the Planning
Commission for review, comment and approval, before being referred back to
Council for their final review and action to incorporate into the Codified
Ordinances. (Ord. 28-2017. Passed 10-2-17.)
CHAPTER 1131
The Great Circle Overlay District (GCOD)
1131.01   Historical significance.
1131.02   Designation criteria.
1131.03   Application.
1131.04   Viewshed District description.
1131.05   Intent.
1131.01 HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE.
   (a)   Since the very early 1800's it has been recognized that the ancient
Native-American Neward Earthworks, located in Heath and nearby Newark, Ohio
represent invaluable historic significance found only in a small number of Ohio
River Valley sites. These sites have been passed on to the Ohio History
Connection, formerly the Ohio Historical Society, for study and preservation.
In cooperation with the National Park Service, these sites have been submitted
and are currently being evaluated for inclusion by UNESCO to the World Heritage
list. Such inclusion would place these Ohio sites on par with such other
National and World Historic Landmarks as found in the Mission District of San
Antonio, Texas, highlighted by The Alamo.
   (b)   The earthworks are attributed to the Hopewell civilization dating to
the period 100 B.C. to A.D. 400. As recognized in the Ohio History Connection
publication The Newark Earthworks, head archaeologist Dr. Bradley Leper notes
that these represent the largest connected set of geometric earthworks ever
built. It is a treasure to the people of Ohio that the Great Circle Mound
remains largely intact and undeveloped.
(Ord. 29-2017. Passed 10-2-17.)
1131.02  DESIGNATION CRITERIA.
   The proposed Overlay District is located in Heath and Newark within a 1,500-
foot radius of the center of the Great Circle Mound with the following
coordinates, Ohio State Plane Coordinate System, Ohio South Zone [Northing:
743391.904, Easting: 1987788.516], [Lat: 40º02'27.56"N, Long: 82º25'52.00"W].
The purpose of the District is to recognize and protect the field of view, or
Viewshed, from within the site. The circular mounds serve to obstruct a certain
amount of outer perimeter sight-line, however; this District establishes
maximum heights for future improvements in the areas surrounding the Great
Circle.
(Ord. 29-2017. Passed 10-2-17.)
1131.03  APPLICATION.
   This Overlay District is included in the Zoning Ordinances of the City of
Heath as a special and unique protection area. Currently, the surrounding
1,500-foot radius is represented by three zoning designations as follows:
   (a)   An (R-1) Single Family Residential District, the Southgate
subdivision, located west and southwest of the Great Circle. Currently, these
homes are all one story construction, with an average height of approximately
16 feet, well under the maximum allowable of 30 feet per current zoning.
   (b)   A (B-3) General Business District, located on both sides of S.R. 79 to
the south and southeast. The general business district has one adjacent Giant
Eagle store that approximates 40 feet in height in one small central area, well
under the current zonings allowable height of 50 feet. However there is a
visual screen of pine trees on the NW corner of that store. The remainder of
the store and the adjacent stores approximate heights up to 26 feet.
   (c)   The (M-2) General Manufacturing District, located due east along S.R.
79 and north of Hopewell Dr., has the Matthews Ford Dealership and the former
Meritor Plant, each having approximate heights of 26 feet, well within the
maximum allowable zoning height of 50 feet.
      (Ord. 29-2017. Passed 10-2-17.)
1131.04  VIEWSHED DISTRICT DESCRIPTION.
   The proposed height restrictions for development or redevelopment would be
as described in the following chart, based upon the existing ground elevations:
   (a)   The Residential Zoning District shall be permitted to have an
allowable height of the existing conditions as constructed, with a maximum
allowable height for redevelopment, renovations, or additions of 16 feet.
   (b)   The Business District shall have an allowable height of the existing
conditions as constructed, with a maximum allowable height for redevelopment,
renovations, or additions of 20 feet.
   (c)   The Manufacturing District shall have an allowable heigth of the
existing conditions as constructed, with a maximum allowable height for
redevelopment, renovations or additions of 20 feet.
      (Ord. 29-2017. Passed 10-2-17.)
1131.05 INTENT.
   The intent of the Overlay district therefore would be to limit future
redevelopment, renovations, or additions in that area to maximum allowable
heights corresponding to the new Viewshed. The area to the north of The Great
Circle is located in the City of Newark and is predominantly housing of varying
ages and heights. A corresponding zoning overlay district is anticipated within
that municipality.
(Ord. 29-2017. Passed 10-2-17.)
 
CHAPTER 1132
The Test Track Overlay District (TTOD)
1132.01    Zones.
1132.02    Zone 1 - Assisted Living and Senior Housing.
1132.03    Zone 2 - Multi-Family.

1132.06    Zone 6 - Single-Family lots of 14,500 square feet.
1132.07    Locations.
1132.01 ZONES.
   The Test Track Overlay District (TTOD) establishes six subareas ("Zones") on
the parcel, and the greater development and design standards ("Overlay
Standards") are as follows:
(Ord. 18-2023. Passed 4-17-23.)
1132.02 ZONE 1-ASSJSTED LIVING AND SENIOR HOUSING.
   The Overlay Standards applicable to Zone 1 are as follows:
ASSISTED LIVING AND SENIOR HOUSING OVERLAY ZONE
1)    PURPOSE OF ASSISTED LIVING AND SENIOR HOUSING OVERLAY ZONE
2)    USES
3)    DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
4)    FENCING

the Assisted Living and Senior Housing Overlay Zone is to promote the public
health, safety, and welfare by allowing increased land use flexibility through
specialized zoning techniques to assure: A) that health and human services are
appropriately located throughout the community and that neighborhood diversity
is permitted without ignoring legitimate concerns regarding impacts on
surrounding residential areas, and to further the objective offederal law by
integrating health and human service facilities.into normal surroundings; and
B) that individuals can continue to contribute to the community without having
heavy yard care maintenance and without ignoring legitimate concerns regarding
impacts on surrounding residential areas.
2)   USES. Only the following uses shall be permitted:
   a)   Assisted Living Facilities: for older adults, licensed by the State of
Ohio as Residential Care Facilities.
   b)   Senior Housing: Single or attached dwelling (not more than two
attached), intended to provide housing primarily for persons fifty-five (55)
years of age or older ("Age-Qualified Occupant"). The community shall be
developed as age-restricted in accordance with the Fair Housing Amendments Act
of 1988, as amended from time-to-time ("FHAA”), including but not limited to
the provisions of the "Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995" and all other
applicable state and federal laws. Each Dwelling Unit, if occupied, shall be
occupied by at least one (1) individual fifty-five (55) years of age or older;
provided, however, that once a Dwelling Unit is occupied by an Age-Qualified
Occupant, other non-age-qualified residents of that Dwelling Unit may continue
to occupy the Dwelling Unit, regardless of the termination of the Age-Qualified
Occupant's occupancy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at all times, at least
eighty percent (80%) of the occupied Dwelling Units within the community shall
be occupied by at least one (1) individual fifty-five (55) years of age or
older. Accessory apartments will not be permitted in the community.

system. The City may require additional water connections and meters at their
discretion and authorize the use of oversize connections and a master meter for
the project. Each unit shall be equipped with an easily accessible shutoff
valve.
         ii.    Sewer - Each unit shall be connected to the City's sewer system
either by an individual or common lateral, whichever is determined applicable
by the City.
         iii.    All utility systems and downspout drainage shall be placed
underground.
4)   FENCING. Subject to the Clear Vision Requirements herein walls and/or
fences in the Assisted Living and Senior Housing Overlay Zone shall be erected
with a type of material to be approved by the Planning Commission.

corners of all property at the intersection of two (2) streets or a street and
an alley.
      i.   A clear vision area shall consist of a triangular area, two (2)
sides of which are lot lines measured from the corner intersection of the
street lot lines for a distance specified in this subsection A, or where the
lot lines have rounded corners, the lot lines extended in a straight line to a
point of intersection and so measured and the third side of which is a line
across the corner of the lot joining the nonintersecting ends of the other two
(2) sides.
      ii.   The minimum distance shall be thirty (30) feet.
   b)   A clear vision area shall contain no planting, fence, wall, structure
or temporary or permanent obstruction exceeding two and one-half (2-1/2) feet
in height, measured from the top of the curb or, where no curb exists, from the
established street centerline grade; except, that trees exceeding this height
may be located in this area, provided all branches and foliage are removed to a
height of eight (8) feet above the grade.
6)   PARKING.  The following on-site parking requirements apply. Lighting
standards will be required for lots that require more than twenty-five (25)

the program's vehicles, hazard insurance on the facility, and liability
insurance to cover residents and third-party individuals.
   d)    Prior to occupancy in an assisted living facility, the person or
entity licensed or certified by the Department of Human Services or Department
of Health to establish and operate the facility shall:
      i.    Provide a copy of such license or certification to the City and
      ii.    Certify in a sworn affidavit to the City that no person will
reside or remain in the facility whose tenancy would likely constitute a direct
threat to the health or safety of other individuals or result in the
substantial physical damage to the property of others
   e)    The assisted living facility shall comply with all health and safety
codes applicable to that type of building and use.
   f)    The use permitted by this section is non-transferable and shall

in accordance with applicable City of Heath Zoning, Development, and/or
Subdivision Regulations.
10)   ASSISTED LIVING DESIGN GUIDELINES In developing an assisted living
facility within the Assisted Living - Senior Housing Zone, the following design
guidelines and criteria will govern review and approval of a specific project
Evidence Based Design (EBD)
THE DEFINITION OF BASIC DESIGN ATTRIBUTES
This category covers the basic design decisions when planning, designing and
building long term care facilities. The basic design layouts of households /
neighborhoods is the main building block that can result in positive health
outcomes engaging all seven groups of design intervention. The research focuses
on Special Care Units, small scale environments, low social densities, and
building layouts.
Evidence shows that providing segregated care in Special Care Units (SCU) has a
tangible impact on resident behavior, their social abilities, and care
outcomes. Studies of residents with cognitive impairments living in small-
scale environments indicate mainly positive effects on all outcomes
investigated; strong evidence was found for improved social abilities,
functionality and well-being. This is further supported by findings showing
that a low social density is positively associated with residents' behavior and
care outcomes.

Household

DESIGN CRITERIA
1.    Organize the Facility into Households that are as small as staffing and
servicing efficiencies will permit. Provide no more than ten to twelve (10-12)
residents to a household.
2.    Include familiar spatial organization similar to that found in a typical
house/home.
3.    Design the spaces to allow residents to move freely within the household
and from one room to another without having to use a corridor (i.e. rooms are
laid out contiguous to each other).
4.    Eliminate corridors whenever possible. This includes eliminating typical
double loaded corridors that serve entire households. Should corridors be
incorporated they should serve an immediate section of resident bedrooms of not
more than six (6) residents. Bedrooms should not open up directly into main
corridors that serve as the general circulation for a "ward".
5.    Design spaces so that allocentric orientation is possible (see
wayfinding).
6.    Provide multiple opportunities for intimate or private conversation that
are comfortable,
designed for couples or small groups.
7.    Utilize a form of cluster plan that centralizes shared spaces amongst
resident bedrooms. This accomplishes maintaining line of sight to significant
spaces such as hearth (kitchen) living and dining areas (see examples following
this section for suggested cluster plan layouts).
8.    Features such as windows or wall openings between spaces for visual
connections, minimized hallway distances, and areas that promote staff presence
should be included.
9.    Incorporate passage or transitional space connecting two (2) households,
with the ability to keep it open or closed. This allows two (2) households to
combine for programmed activities if desired, for residents to leave their home
to "visit the neighbors" and provides easier capability for limited staff to
monitor two (2) households during the night.
10.    Two (2) households can be linked or adjoin each other to share common
support spaces such as admin spaces, soiled and clean linens, mechanical and
electrical, and staff-assist bathing suites.
11.    Households should provide a shared, resident-accessed kitchen, (see
kitchen design section for access limitations) dining area, and living room,
plus secure outdoor space appropriate in scale for smaller populations. Focus
on maintaining an intimate setting which attracts small group socialization
much the same way a private home kitchen serves as the hub of the family
gathering and socialization.
12.    Within the household, provide small group spaces with some visual and
acoustic privacy. These spaces can be used by residents who get easily
overwhelmed by crowds and noise. For instance, large, noisy dining spaces have
been linked with an individual's reduced food intake.
13.    Avoid multi-purpose rooms for residents associated with the household or
neighborhood. A multipurpose room can be included outside of the neighborhood
community for larger group gatherings; however, it should be located in a main
separate building or distinct separate zone.
14.    Create spaces that can house shared activities between households. If
smaller numbers of residents per household want to participate in an activity,
operational efficiency can be gained by grouping two (2) smaller resident
groups together for that activity.
15.    Design intermediate spaces that allow for transitions between private
and public areas. Bedrooms are the most private spaces that belong to
residents. When designing to the context of a small house model the absence of
corridors can make separation between bedroom and living spaces difficult.
The designer should incorporate the separation of the four (4) major types of
space found within the
household. These include:
   •    Private spaces: Resident Bedrooms / Resident Bathrooms.
   •    Semi Private Spaces: Transitional spaces between bedroom egress and
living spaces. This may be simple as creating a "front porch" zone in front of
resident room areas which provides demarcation between room and semi-public
activity areas.
   •    Semi Public spaces: Living and activity areas shared primarily by
residents who belong to the same household or neighborhood. Visiting loved
ones. will also become guests of the home and be invited to share living room
and kitchen areas. Creating a sense of "guest in the home" helps the residents
identify their space as their own home and will be more comfortable accepting
visitors. Quality of visitation is much improved when this relationship of
homeowner and guest is reinforced.
   •    Public Spaces: areas intended for group functions which bring mixed
resident household populations and visitors together.
16.   Provide easy access to an outdoor space. The best location to provide
access is from the central activity areas where residents can visually see and
freely access a safe outdoor patio area.
17.    Provide decks on upper stories so that each household has their own
outdoor environment.
18.    Include enclosed comtyards within the building footprint. These
courtyards are fully enclosed and secure by nature of being surrounded by the
building(s), allowing residents free access without fear of wandering away from
the facility.
19.    Include outdoor activity amenities such as active bird feeders, walking
paths, and raised gardens. Outdoor space should support passive as well as
active activities.
20.    Ensure all outdoor areas remain wheel chair and walker accessible.
Consider materials used on pathways to ensure no uneven surfaces or tripping
hazards over time.
21.    Secure outdoor spaces with perimeter fencing at least six (6) feet high,
and camouflage the fencing with landscape design features such as trees or
shrubs so it does not attract residents' attention or feel prison-like. In
addition, the fence and landscaping should not have ladder-like elements that
could be used for climbing and furnishings should also prevent a resident from
scaling the fence.
22.    Construct walking paths that are continuous and loop back to building
entrances. There should be "multiple cues” that reduce demand on the user,
allowing one to enjoy walking in a natural environment without the frustration
of figuring out how to return.
23.    There are two distinct forms of outdoor space that the designer needs to
be familiar with.
Together with the landscape consultant the designer should understand the
differences and benefits of a healing garden, vs. a horticultural and
therapeutic landscape. The most common outdoor space designed for long term
care homes is a sensory garden (a form of healing garden) with a section of
horticultural gardening which may include elements such as raised garden beds.
24.    Consider building in raised planting beds where residents can
participate in gardening activities. Beds should allow residents to sit on the
edge while working or drive a wheelchair alongside.
25.    Provide sufficient resting spots (benches) along longer walkways, or
handrails to assist those with mobility issues. Handrails can provide short
term rest areas by leaning on them, and also assist with balance for those who
require it. Seating will also allow multiple areas for passive enjoyment;
ensure some areas also allow for wheel parking off the main walkway paths.
26.    Design spaces so that smaller groups function autonomously. Households
with smaller population sizes reduce over stimulation. Larger unit size
(greater than fourteen (14) residents are associated with higher resident
agitation levels and increased intellectual deterioration and emotional
disturbances).
27.    In addition to bedrooms, households should provide a shared, resident-
accessed kitchen, dining area, and living room, and secure outdoor space.
Additional areas for residents within the household may include (but are not
limited to) a spa/bathing room, small den and/or activity space
28.    Within the household, provide small group spaces with some visual and
acoustic privacy. These spaces can be used by residents who get easily
overwhelmed by crowds and noise.
29.    Exterior massing should be articulated (with distinct elements and walls
that jog to create different planes, rather than a solid, monolithic facade)
and at a scale that relates to a person (i.e., "human- scale"), with
residential detailing and materials appropriate to the building's locale.
30.    Provide a distinct entrance to each household complete with all the
elements consistent of home entrance. Front porch, mailbox, doorbell, exterior
materials, and so on. The household entrance is the front door to each person's
residence no different than the front door in your own home.
31.    Rooms are arranged enfilade, which means walking through rooms rather
than hallways to get to a place ( e.g., walking through the living room to
enter the dining room).
32.    Include familiar spatial relationships as you would find in one's home.
This would bring a family dining room adjacent to a living room. Access to an
ontside porch should be designed from either the living area or dining area as
the kitchen is central to the household plan.
33.    Provide open counters low enough for residents to sit and pmticipate in
kitchen activities from the adjacent space.
34.    Style of cabinetry shonld be traditional and built out of wood as
opposed to a melamine (rail and stile is appropriate) Specify residential
hardware. Try to avoid "D" style pnlls.
35.    Create an area where food is available to residents all the time. Space
should be planned so residents can access a snack, fruit, or a drink either on
their own or with assistance, without having to enter into the kitchen work
triangle reserved for care givers.
36.   In addition to providing a flexible dining area where table/chair
placement can be modified, the household should also contain areas where
individual interests can take place. A hobby area provides opportunity for
artwork, clay modelling, woodworking, scrap booking, and so on. Allow an area
ont of the way from the lounging and passive spaces as to not disrupt
television viewing and casual socializing.
37.    Create an area in each resident room where personal activities such as
listening to music,
reading, looking at a memory book, or one-on-one visiting can occur. This area
should be organized in such a way that hobbies or personal activities are
highly visible or displayed without clutter, to encourage use. The area should
be distinctly separate from the bed, to give the feel of a different space.
38.    Common causes of both audible and visual overstimulation to individuals
with dementia are busy entry doors. When possible, the designer should minimize
the amount of doors that are visible to the residents that lead to areas of
administration or public zones. The introduction of transitional corridors
assists in avoiding doors opening onto paths freqnented by residents.
39.    Specify silent alarm systems that activate small buzzers held by staff.
40.    Remove audible fifteen (15) second delay alarm on exit doors equipped
with magnetic locks. This will require alternate solutions submission to
authorities having jurisdiction (AHJ) and may not be supported.
11)   APPLICATION OF BASE R-3 ZONING REGULATIONS. All zoning regulations
applicable to R-3 zoning districts apply to the Assisted Living and Senior
Housing Overlay Zone. If there is a conflict between the standards set forth in
the Assisted Living and Senior Housing Overlay Standards and those set forth in
the zoning regulations applicable to an R-3 zoning district, the more
restrictive standards shall control.

SITE DESIGN
1.    PROJECTED FRONTAGE
INTENT:
•    Provide for an attractive and active relationship between the building and
the street.
•    Provide privacy and security to residents facing the street.
•    Encourage social interaction between residents and pedestrians.
•    Provide a comfortable and welcoming entry, visible from the sidewalk, and
an attractive streetscape.
•    Provide an inviting ground floor facade.
FOR ALL PROJECTS:
1.    Provide individual unit entries at ground level (accessible from
outside). Ground level unit entries can open onto the street or a courtyard or
open space that opens to the street. The Planning Commission may allow other
entry configurations (such as consolidated entries), provided the design meets
the intent of this section.
   a.    To provide resident privacy and a transition between the public and
private realm, set the building back at least thirty (30) feet from the public
right-of-way or raise the ground floor living space at least three feet above
the sidewalk or pathway grade (preferably both, as in the Figure below).
   b .    Entries must be accessible from the street or Interior open space.
Configurations where enclosed rear yards back up to a street are prohibited.
   c.    Individual pedestrian entries must be emphasized by using all of the
following:
      i.    Provide a porch, at least twenty-four (24) square feet, or other
architectural weather protection that provides cover for a person entering the
unit and a transitional space between outside and inside the dwelling.
      ii.    Provide a planted area in front of each pedestrian entry of at
least twenty (20) square feet in area, with no dimension less than three (3)
feet. Provide a combination of shrubs, groundcover or trees.
      iii.    Set the garage door (if applicable) at least five (5) feet
farther from the street than the primary street-facing facade.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4101_6108x4224.jpg]
   d.    For projects with individual garages, vehicle access to ground floor
units shall be from an alley if one exists. For any configuration where primary
pedestrian access is off the same facade as vehicular access, developments
shall incorporate single-width parking configurations for at least fifty
percent (50%) of the units (to minimize the impact of garage doors on the
pedestrian environment). A pedestrian entry shall be provided that is separate
from the garage door.
2.    Surface parking shall not be located between the building and the street.
(If multiple buildings, this only applies to the building(s) abutting the
street.)
3.    Structured parking shall not constitute the entire frontage of any
street-adjacent building. Structured parking must be screened per Vehicles and
Parking
   i.   For corner properties with structured parking, provide a minimum of
fifteen (15) feet from the corner along the primary street frontage in an
active use. For non-corner properties, provide a minimum of fifteen (15) feet
anywhere along the street frontage in an active use.
      •   Active uses can include lobbies, entrances, gyms or fitness centers,
meeting rooms and other similar spaces. Active use spaces may not contain mail
rooms, storage, or any unsightly use (as determined by the Planning
Commission).
      •   Active uses must be visible through transparent window areas over the
entire fifteen (15) feet of the ground floor facade between two (2) feet and
eight (8) feet above grade. The windows must look into the building's interior.
4.    If property is within one-fourth (1/4) mile of a bus stop or public park,
provide convenient pathways or entries to facilitate access to these amenities
for residents,
5.   Integrate weather protection, gutters and downspouts into the design of
the structure as a whole.
6,    Limit the length of at-grade building facade and walls without openings
(windows or doors) to fifteen (15) feet.
7.    Fencing or walls above four (4) feet high are not allowed in the front
yard or between the principal facade/entry and the sidewalk or public street.
The Planning Commission may allow walls above four (4) feet in height to
accommodate sleep topography. Chain link fences are not allowed in the front
yard or between the primary building and a public right-of-way (excluding
alleys).
8,    For projects approved by the Planning Commission for consolidated
entries, enhance the building's presence and optimize interaction with the
public sidewalk and rights-of-way through use of at least two (2) of the
following:
   i,    Pergolas or arbors
   ii.    See-though gates or fences ( excluding chain link)
   iii.    Outdoor terraces or gardens that are designed to promote use (i.e.,
with benches or other pedestrian furniture or features)
   iv.    High quality entry path materials such as special paving, tile, etc.
   v.    Balconies facing street

Figure 2. Good and bad examples of garage/entry configurations. The left
example features a landscaped area and stoop to enhance the entry. The
townhouses in the middle photo tuck the garages under the living units to
reduce their visibility (note that this is a private roadway). In the right
image, the lack of landscaping is a glaring omission, and is not acceptable.
II. VEHICLES AND PARKING
INTENT:
•   Diminish and soften the visual impact of pavement and parked cars from the
street and adjacent properties.
•   Increase pedestrian safety and vehicular circulation in parking areas.
SURFACE PARKING
All projects with surface parking must adhere to the following in the design of
parking lots and on-site vehicular circulation:
1.    Surface parking shall be located to the rear of street-adjacent
buildings. Alternatively, surface parking may be provided to the side of
street-adjacent buildings, but not on a corner. A maximum of sixty (60) linear
feet of surface parking is permitted adjacent to the street.
2.    Provide designated pedestrian pathways from public sidewalks and through
surface parking areas to site destinations such as building entries and rear
parking areas. Generally, walkways must be provided at least every four rows of
parking or at least every 130 feet, whichever is less. Align the pathways to
connect with major building entries or other sidewalks, pathways and
destinations.
3.    Minimize the width and extent of driveways in the front yards and visible
from the street. The Planning Commission may determine the location and size of
the driveway entrance (curb cut) to maximize safety and minimize impacts to
pedestrian and bicycle movement.
4.    Vehicular ingress and egress shall be from an alley, where one exists.
The second choice of access (if no alleys exist) shall be from the street with
less traffic, as determined by the Planning Commission. The third most
desirnble access choice is collector streets, and arterial streets are the
fourth and least desirable choice for vehicular ingress and egress.
5.    Where there are significant changes in elevation, utilize topography to
reduce the visibility of parking from public areas and adjacent properties.
STRUCTURED PARKING
All projects must adhere to the following in the design of structured parking:
1.    Structured parking may not constitute the entire frontage of any street-
adjacent building. See Project Frontage for frontage requirements related to
structured parking.
2.    Locate structured parking to minimize visual impact to residences and
public streets. Ensure parking structures visible from public streets are
architecturally compatible with the main structure, and provide building and
finish elements that create visual interest to the streetscape.
3.    Where structured parking is adjacent to the sidewalk or within ten (10)
feet of the sidewalk edge, the facade shall incorporate a combination of
artwork, grillwork, special building material or other treatment/design that
enhances the pedestrian environment. Small setbacks with terraced landscaping
elements can be particularly effective in softening the appearance of
structured parking.
4.    Parking facilities shall be well-lit for safety with non-glare lighting
to reduce impacts to adjacent uses. See Lighting for lighting level standards.
5.    For single-family homes and duplexes, at least two (2) parking spaces are
required per dwelling unit. For multiple-family dwellings (three (3) or more
units), parking shall be provided as follows:
6.    At least one (1) parking space is required for each bedroom.
7.    At least one (1) bicycle parking space is required for every two (2)
units.
8.    With multiple-family dwellings, attached garages shall not face or open
towards a street. Attached garages associated with one and two-family dwellings
may face the street, but must be set back at least six (6) feet behind the
front facade.
9.    Enclosed garage parking spaces shall count towards no more than thirty
percent (30%) of the total nwnber of required off-street parking spaces for
multiple-family dwellings (three (3) or more units).
III. PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION
INTENT:
•   Provide convenient, safe and attractive pedestrian routes.
•   Increase social interaction.
FOR ALL PROJECTS:
1.    Pedestrian walks shall be separated from residential structures by at
least three (3) feet for landscaping. The Planning Commission may consider
other treatments to provide attractive pathways.
2.    Where not visible to the public (i.e., on the interior of the site), all
paths shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width.
3.    Public pathways must be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA).
IV. SETBACKS AND PRIVACY
INTENT:
•   Provide privacy for residents, especially those immediately adjacent to the
proposed development.
•   Protect light and air access for residents of proposed development as well
as residents in adjacent existing structures.
FOR ALL PROJECTS:
Design project to reduce intrusion and impacts to adjacent and nearby
properties through meeting all of the following:
1.    Offset window placement to avoid direct sightlines between living spaces.
2.    Orient courtyards and balconies to maximize privacy.
3.    Landscape all setbacks with a combination of landscape, hardscape or
other amenities.
4.    Shape upper levels to increase solar access, light, and air to adjacent
lower structures, on- and off-site open spaces, and adjoining residential land
uses.
FOR PROJECTS WITH LOT LINES ABUTTING AN EXISTING SINGLE-FAMILY ZONE:
Abutting an existing single-family zone: Provide an appropriate transition or
complement to adjacent single-family zones. Projects shall create a step in
perceived height, bulk or scale between the anticipated development potential
of the adjacent single-family zone and the the proposed development. This can
be done through any of the following:
1.    Increasing the distance from the building to the edge of the single-
family zone.
   a.    Set building back from interior or rear lot lines abutting single-
family zones a minimum of two (2) feet for every ten (10) feet in height.
2.    Providing shading or increased landscape buffer at the edge of a single-
family zone.
3.    Stepping back upper floors so building height/mass is less intense near
single-family zone.
4.    Matching the scale of adjacent single-family zone developments in
building detailing.
V. OPEN SPACE
INTENT:
•   Add to the livability of new residences.
•   Provide visual interest and relief.
•   Provide opportunities for outdoor activities.
•   Provide light and air in a new residential development.
•   Provide opportunities for social interaction.
FOR ALL PROJECTS
All projects must provide 150 square feet of on-site open space per dwelling
unit. Acceptable types of open space include:
1.    Common outdoor open space
   •   Where accessible to all residents, common outdoor open space may count
for up to one hundred percent (100%) of the required open space. Common outdoor
open space includes landscaped courtyards, shared decks, gardens with pathways,
children's play areas, pools, water features, accessible (unfenced) areas used
for stormwater retention or other multipurpose recreational or green spaces to
which all residents have access, Special requirements for common open spaces
include the following:
   •   Required setback areas shall not count toward the open space requirement
unless they are part of an open space that meets the other requirements of
common open space.
   •   Space shall have a minimum dimension of fifteen (15) feet in any
direction to provide functional leisure or recreational activity. This
dimension can be waived based on site conditions such as topography or
irregular lot geometry.
   •   Space shall feature paths or walkable areas, landscaping, seating,
lighting, play structures, sports courts or other pedestrian amenities to make
the area more functional and enjoyable for a range of users, taking into
consideration potential noise issues related to hard court sports such as
basketball, tennis and handball.
   •   Common space shall be separated from ground level windows, streets,
service areas and parking lots with landscaping, low-level decorative fencing
(no chain link), or other treatments as approved by the Planning Commission
that enhance safety and privacy for both the common open space and dwelling
units.
   •   The space shall be oriented to receive sunlight and preferably face
south, if possible. Open space may also face east or west, but not north,
unless the Planning Commission determines that site conditions such as
topography or irregular lot geometry warrant waiving this requirement.
   •   The space must be accessible from the dwelling units. Ideally, it should
be centrally located, if practical. The space must be oriented to encourage
activity from local residents.
2.    Balconies
Individual balconies or patios (not including covered porches or stoops) may be
used for up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the required open space. To qualify
as open space, balconies or patios must be at least forty (40) square feet,
with no dimension less than five (5) feet
3.   Rooftop decks and terraces
Rooftop decks and terraces may be used to meet up to fifty percent (50%) of the
required open space, provided the following conditions are met:
   •   Space must be accessible to all dwelling units and ADA compliant.
   •   Space must provide amenities such as seating areas, barbeques,
fireplaces, recreational spaces, landscaping, etc.
   •   Space must feature surfacing which enables residents to use the open
space.
   •   Space must incorporate features that provide for the safety of
residents, such as appropriate lighting levels. See Safety and Security
4.    On-site indoor recreation areas
Indoor recreation areas may be used to meet up to twenty-five percent (25%) of
the required open space provided the following conditions are met:
   •   Space must be ADA accessible to all dwelling units.
   •   Space is designed for and includes equipment for recreational uses,
preferably for a range of users.
5.    Sensitive or critical areas
Sensitive areas shall only count toward open space requirements if integrated
into the site design to be visible and usable by residents with features such
as trails and benches. Sensitive or critical areas meeting these requirements
may count for up to fifty percent (50%) of the required open space, but only
the space utilized by the built amenities or trails, including a five-foot
radius around the amenities, shall be counted.
VI. LIGHTING
INTENT:
•   Provide for personal safety and security.
•   Reduce the adverse impacts of lighting and retain dark skies.
FOR ALL PROJECTS
All publicly accessible areas and areas commonly used by residents shall be
lighted with levels as follows:
1.    Areas of low pedestrian activity such as service areas and vehicular
traffic areas: minimum 0.2 foot-candles (fc), maximum four (4) fc.
2.    Moderate or high volume pedestrian areas and building entries: minimum
one fc, maximum five fc, preferred average two (2) fc.
3.    Public parking lots: minimum one fc, maximum four (4) fc.
Additionally, all projects must meet the following:
1.    Lighting shall be provided at consistent levels, with an average lighting
level to minimum lighting level uniformity ratio no less than 3:1, to create
gradual transitions between varying levels of lighting and between lit areas
and unlit areas. Highly contrasting pools of light and dark areas shall be
avoided.
2.    Pedestrian lighting shall have a maximum height of fifteen (15) feet.
3.    Parking area lighting fixtures shall be fully shielded, dark sky rated
and mounted no more than twenty (20) feet above the ground, with lower fixtures
preferable so as to maintain a human scale.
4.    Steady, non-flashing lighting of building features, artwork and special
landscape elements may be allowed, subject to the findings of the Planning
Commission that the light causes no significant adverse impact.
5.    Provide lighting that complements the building and site design and
provides for safe pedestrian circulation and gathering places while minimizing
light spillage off-site.
VII. DUMPSTERS, UTILITIES AND SERVICE AREAS
INTENT:
•   Minimize the visual, auditory and olfactory impacts of waste handling,
storage areas, utilities and other similar facilities.
•   Allow for the efficient movement of utility functions and servicing of
buildings.
LOCATION AND DESIGN
The visual, auditory, and olfactory impacts of waste handling, storage areas,
utilities and similar activities and facilities shall be minimized. Reduce
impacts of refuse containers and storage areas through all of the following
measures:
1.    Service areas (loading docks, trash dumpsters, compactors, recycling
areas, electrical panels and mechanical equipment areas) shall be located to
avoid negative visual, auditory (noise), olfactory or physical impacts on the
street environment and adjacent residentially zoned properties. The Planning
Commission may require evidence that such elements will not significantly
impact neighboring properties or public areas. (For example, the Planning
Commission may require noise damping specifications for fans near residential
zones.) Service areas shall be sited for alley access if available.
2.    Service areas must not be visible from the sidewalk and adjacent
properties. Where the Planning Commission finds that the only option for
locating a service area is either visible from a public right-of-way or space
or from an adjacent property, the area must be screened with either landscape
or structural screening measures provided under "Screening" (below, this
section).
3.    Ground-mounted mechanical equipment must be located and screened to
minimize visual and noise impacts to pedestrians on streets and adjoining
properties.
4.    Roof-mounted mechanical equipment must be located and screened so the
equipment is not visible from the ground level of adjacent streets or
properties within twenty (20) feet of the structure. Match the color of roof
mounted equipment with the exposed color of the roof to minimize visual impacts
when equipment is visible from higher elevations nearby.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4107_9489x2760.jpg]
5.    Locate and screen utility meters, electrical conduit and other service
and utilities apparatus so they are not visible from adjoining properties and
nearby streets.
6.    Other provisions of this section notwithstanding, service areas used by
residents shall be located to avoid entrapment areas and other conditions where
personal security would be compromised. The Planning Commission may require
pedestrian-scaled lighting or other measures to enhance security.
7.    Locate or shield noise producing mechanical equipment such as fans or
heat pumps to meet state law provisions
8.    All service connections and on-site utilities including wires and pipes
must be located underground. Meters may be attached to buildings. Project
proponents are required to coordinate with the local electric utility provider
to locate electrical service facilities in the least obtrusive way.
SCREENING
Where screening of service areas is called for (where impacts cannot be
adequately addressed through location or other means described above), adhere
to the following:
1.    A structural enclosure shall be constructed of masonry, heavy-gauge metal
or decay-resistant composite wood, and have a roof. The walls must be
sufficient to provide full screening from the affected roadway or use. The
enclosure may use overlapping walls to screen dumpsters and other materials.
Gates shall be made of heavy-gauge, sight-obscuring material, and the enclosure
shall be designed to be architecturally consistent and compatible with the
architectural concept for the site or building it serves.
2.    Collection points shall be located and configured so that the enclosure
gate swing does not obstruct pedestrian or vehicle traffic, or does not require
that a hauling truck project into any public right-of-way.
3.    The service area shall be paved.
4.    Weather protection of recyclables, trash and compost/yard waste shall be
ensured by using weather-proof containers or by providing a roof over the
storage area.
5.    In addition to the required screening, artwork such as paint schemes or
coverings that help to blend the equipment into the background may also be
utilized.
BUILDING DESIGN
VIII. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
INTENT:
•   Provide a welcoming entry to residential buildings.
•   Provide a visually interesting roofline.
•   Achieve architectural scale that is compatible with the size and visual
massing of development envisioned within the zoning classification.
•   Add visual interest and sense of quality and craftsmanship to building
facades.
•   Enhance the pedestrian experience.
DEFINITIONS:
Architectural scale. Perceived height and bulk of a building relative to that
of neighboring buildings or anticipated future neighboring developments. A
building has "good architectural scale" if its visual size is relatively
similar to development that is planned for in the zoning classification.
Modulation. Stepping back or projecting forward of portions of a building face,
within specified intervals of building width and depth, as a means of breaking
up the apparent bulk of a structure's continuous exterior walls.
Articulation. Visually enhancing a building fac;ade by including features such
as broken rooflines, chimneys, entrances, distinctive window patterns,
BUILDING ENTRY DESIGN
Principal building entrances of all buildings shall feature all of the
following:
1.    A minimum of fifty (50) square feet of pedestrian weather protection.
Entries may satisfy this requirement by being set back into the building
facade.
2.    Lighting, to conform to Lighting
3,    Building or business name and address number.
4.    Transparency such as glass doors, windows or glazing (window area) near
the door so that the visitor and occupant can view people opening the door from
the other side (not required for individual unit entries leading directly to a
single dwelling).
5.    Security, to the extent feasible. Entries must be visible from areas with
high pedestrian activity.
6.    Architectural or artwork enhancements, including one or more of the
following:
   a.    Ornamental doors or windows,
   b.    Ornamental paving or materials (e.g., decorative tile work),
   c.    Distinctive architectural lighting,
   d.    Artwork,
   e.    Landscaping, or
   f.    Adjacent usable open space.
ROOFLINE CHARACTER
All projects must provide a roofline design that fits with the character of the
building and provides some level of visual interest. The upper level or top of
the building should have a considered (intentional) treatment. This may be done
in any of the following ways:
1.    Design a shaped, sloped, pitched or varied roof form - visible to
passersby from public areas including highways or other distant views.
2.    Provide cornice expressions, eyebrows, overhangs, horizontal projections.
3.    Increase variety of building massing at upper levels to establish
contrast with overall bulk and mass of lower levels.
4.    Incorporate extensions (chimneys, turrets, towers, skylights,
clerestories - if logical continuation of architecture).
5.    Utilize other height variations to complement adjacent structures.
Avoid superfluous or tack-on roof features such as mansard roof extensions,
roof signs or roof ribs.
FACADE MODULATION AND BULK/MASS DESIGN.
All new buildings over three stories, over 5,000 square feet in gross building
footprint or with facades longer than 100 feet measured horizontally along a
public right-of-way or visible from a public right-of-way shall provide at
least three (3) major modulation or articulation features as described below
along any facade that is visible from a public right-of-way, residential zone
or pedestrian pathway. The "articulation interval" at which the repetitive
element repeats should not be greater than fifty (50) feet.
1.    Horizontal building modulation. Horizontal modulation is the stepping
back or extending forward of building stories or horizontal building elements.
To satisfy this requirement through horizontal modulation, the depth (extension
out or set back from the building facade) of the modulation must be at least
two (2) feet when tied to a change in the roofline and at least five (5) feet
in other situations. Balconies may be used to qualify for this option, provided
they have a floor area of at least forty (40) square feet, are integrated with
the architecture of the building, and project at least two (2) feet from the
building facade. Step backs of upper stories are a common form of horizontal
modulation.
2.    Vertical building modulation. Vertical modulation is the extension or
stepping back of vertical elements of a building. In order to satisfy this
guideline through vertical modulation, the minimum depth of modulation is
eighteen (18) inches and minimum width for each modulation is fifteen (15)
feet. Balconies may not be used to meet this modulation option unless they are
recessed or projected from the facade and integrated with the building's
architecture as determined by the Planning Commission.
3.    Modulated roofline. Buildings may qualify for this option by modulating
the roof line of all facades visible from a street, park or pedestrian pathway
consistent with the following standards:
   a.    For flat roofs or facades with a horizontal fascia (the board at the
end of a roof eave or cornice) or parapet, change the roofline so that there is
a change of the roofline at least every sixty (60) feet. Minimum vertical
dimension of roof line modulation is two (2) feet.
   b.    For gable, hipped or shed roofs, a slope of at least three (3) feet
vertical to twelve (12) feet horizontal is required to meet the guideline.
   c.    Other roof forms such as arched, vaulted, dormer or saw-toothed may
satisfy this design standard if the individual segments of the roof with no
change in slope or discontinuity are less than sixty (60) feet in width
(measured horizontally).
4.   Repeating distinctive window patterns at intervals less than the
articulation interval.
5.    Providing a porch, patio, deck or covered entry for each articulation
interval.
6.   Changing the roofline by alternating dormers, stepped roofs, gables, or
changing roof textures on certain features such as metal roofs on towers and
dormers to reinforce the modulation or articulation interval.
7.    Changing materials with a change in building plane.

X. MATERIALS
INTENT:
•    Help ensure the quality and maintainability of new development.
•    Help ensure attractiveness of new buildings.
FOR ALL PROJECTS
1.    The following are allowed only with special detailing, as described
below:
   a.    Metal siding. When used as a siding material over more than twenty-
five percent (25%) of a building's facade visible from a public area, metal
siding must:
      i.    Have a matte finish in neutral or earth tone such as buff, gray,
beige, tan, cream, white, or a dulled color, such as barn-red, blue-gray,
burgundy, ochre.
      ii.    Include two (2) or more of the following elements:
         1.    Visible window and door trim painted or finished in a
complementary color.
         2.    Color and edge trim that cover exposed edges of the sheet metal
panels.
         3.   A base of masonry, stone or other approved permanent material
extending up to at least two (2) feet above grade that is durable. (The intent
is to provide more durable materials near grade level.)
   b.    Concrete block walls. Concrete block construction used over twenty-
five percent (25%) of a building facade visible from a public area must be
architecturally treated in one or more of the following ways:
      i.    Use of textured blocks with surfaces such as split face or grooved.
      ii.    Use of other masonry types, such as brick, glass block or tile in
conjunction with concrete blocks.
      iii.    Use of decorative coursing to break up blank wall areas.
      iv.    Use of matching colored mortar where color is an element of
architectural treatment for any of the options above.
   c.    Requirements for stucco, stucco-like and similar troweled finishes:
      i.    To avoid deterioration, the finish material must be trimmed or
sheltered from extreme weather by roof overhangs or other methods.
      ii.    The finish material may only be used in conjunction with other
approved building materials.
2.    Any material that is subject to damage and deterioration from human
contact or landscape elements is prohibited within two (2) vertical feet of the
sidewalk or ground level or in areas that are especially subject to vandalism
such as areas with low visibility. In these areas, a more durable finish
material such as brick, concrete or concrete block shall be used.
3.    Use of flat sheet materials such as fiber cement panels (e.g., Hardie
Panel) is not allowed on ground floor facades. This is because the panels do
not provide human scale surfaces ortextures or refined details. Textured panels
on ground floors may be approved by the Planning Commission if they are
detailed not to appear as a panelized system.
4.    Prohibited materials for exterior of buildings (excluding special art
features):
      a.    Mirrored glass.
      b.    Vinyl siding.
      c.    Corrugated fiberglass.
      d.    Chain link fencing within fifty (50) feet of a building's public
entrance (except for temporary purposes such as a construction site).
      e.    Crushed colored rock or tumbled glass.
      f.    Any sheet materials, such as wood or metal siding, with exposed
edges or unfinished edges.
      g.    Any spray-on materials (e.g.: shot-crete) not specifically approved
by the Planning Commission.
      h.    Non-durable materials subject to deterioration if exposed to
weather such as most plastic and synthetic materials or materials that are
particularly vulnerable to vandalism. Project applicants wishing to use
synthetic materials must submit samples and product description Information to
the Planning Commission for approval. The Planning Commission will not accept
such materials unless its durability and appropriateness is demonstrated. (Ord.

GENERAL OBJECTIVES
1)    Meet the Comprehensive Plan land Use Element Goal to revise development
regulations to encourage multifamily development that is more flexible and
innovative in terms of building design, street standards for private roads and
site design.
2)    Contribute to attractiveness and usefulness of the public realm.
3)    Increase the overall durability, construction quality and attractiveness
of multifamily development, as viewed by the public.
4)    Increase City of Heath standing in the region as a desirable place to
live.
5)    Increase pedestrian interest and activity, by facilitating pedestrian
access to gathering places, services and other amenities.
SITE DESIGN
I.    PROJECTED FRONTAGE
INTENT:
•    Provide for an attractive and active relationship between the building and
the street.
•    Provide privacy and security to residents facing the street.
•   Encourage social interaction between residents and pedestrians.
•    Provide a comfortable and welcoming entry, visible from the sidewalk, and
an attractive streetscape.
•    Provide an inviting ground floor facade.
FOR ALL PROJECTS:
1.    Provide individual unit entries at ground level (accessible from
outside). Ground level unit entries can open onto the street or a courtyard or
open space that opens to the street. The Planning Commission may allow other
entry configurations (such as consolidated entries), provided the design meets
the intent of this section.
   a.   To provide resident privacy and a transition between the public and
private realm, set the building back at least thirty (30) feet from the public
right-of-way or raise the ground floor living space at least three (3) feet
above the sidewalk or pathway grade (preferably both, as in the Figure below).
   b .    Entries must be accessible from the street or Interior open space.
Configurations where enclosed rear yards back up to a street are prohibited.
   c.    Individual pedestrian entries must be emphasized by using all of the
following:
      i.    Provide a porch, at least twenty-four (24) square feet, or other
architectural weather protection that provides cover for a person entering the
unit and a transitional space between outside and inside the dwelling.
      ii.    Provide a planted area in front of each pedestrian entry of at
least twenty (20) square feet in area, with no dimension less than three feet.
Provide a combination of shrubs, groundcover or trees.
      iii.    Set the garage door (if applicable) at least five (5) feet
farther from the street than the primary street-facing facade.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4133_6330x4890.jpg]
   d .    For projects with individual garages, vehicle access to ground floor
units shall be from an alley if one exists. For any configuration where primary
pedestrian access is off the same facade as vehicular access, developments
shall incorporate single-width parking configurations for at least fifty
percent (50%) of the units (to minimize the impact of garage doors on the
pedestrian environment). A pedestrian entry shall be provided that Is separate
from the garage door.
2.    Surface parking shall not be located between the building and the street.
(If multiple buildings, this only applies to the building(s) abutting the
street.)
3.    Structured parking shall not constitute the entire frontage of any
street-adjacent building. Structured parking must be screened per Vehicles and
Parking
   i.    For corner properties with structured parking, provide a minimum of
fifteen (15) feet from the corner along the primary street frontage in an
active use. For non-corner properties, provide a minimum of fifteen (15) feet
anywhere along the street frontage in an active use.
      •    Active uses can include lobbies, entrances, gyms or fitness centers,
meeting rooms and other similar spaces. Active use spaces may not contain mail
rooms, storage, or any unsightly use (as determined by the Planning
Commission).
      •    Active uses must be visible through transparent window areas over
the entire fifteen (15) feet of the ground floor facade between two (2) feet
and eight (8) feet above grade. The windows must look into the building's
interior.
4.    If property is within one-fourth (¼) mile of a bus stop or public park,
provide convenient pathways or entries to facilitate access to these amenities
for residents.
5.    Integrate weather protection, gutters and downspouts into the design of
the structure as a whole.
6.    Limit the length of at-grade building facade and wails without openings
(windows or doors) to fifteen (15) feet.
7.    Fencing or walls above four (4) feet high are not allowed in the front
yard or between the principal facade/entry and the sidewalk or public street.
The Planning Commission may allow walls above four (4) feet in height to
accommodate steep topography. Chain link fences are not allowed in the front
yard or between the primmy building and a public right-of-way (excluding
alleys).
8.    For projects approved by the Planning Commission for consolidated
entries, enhance the building's presence and optimize interaction with the
public sidewalk and rights-of-way through use of at least two (2) of the
following:
   i.    Pergolas or arbors
   ii.    See-though gates or fences (excluding chain link)
   iii.   Outdoor terraces or gardens that are designed to promote use (i.e.,
with benches or other pedestrian furniture or features)
   iv.    High quality entry path materials such as special paving, tile, etc.
   v.    Balconies facing street

Figure 2. Good and bad examples of garage/entry configurations. The left
example features a landscaped area and stoop to enhance the entry. The
townhouses in the middle photo tuck the garages under the living units to
reduce their visibility (note that this is a private roadway). In the right
image, the lack of landscaping is a glaring omission, and is not acceptable.
II. VEHICLES AND PARKING
INTENT:
•    Diminish and soften the visual impact of pavement and parked cars from the
street and adjacent properties.
•    Increase pedestrian safety and vehicular circulation in parking areas.
SURFACE PARKING
All projects with surface parking must adhere to the following in the design of
parking lots and on-site vehicular circulation:
1.    Surface parking shall be located to the rear of street-adjacent
buildings. Alternatively, surface parking may be provided to the side of
street-adjacent buildings, but not on a corner. A maximum of sixty (60) linear
feet of surface parking is permitted adjacent to the street.
2.    Provide designated pedestrian pathways from public sidewalks and through
surface parking areas to site destinations such as building entries and rear
parking areas. Generally, walkways must be provided at least every four (4)
rows of parking or at least every 130 feet, whichever is less. Align the
pathways to connect with major building entries or other sidewalks, pathways
and destinations.
3.    Minimize the width and extent of driveways in the front yards and visible
from the street. The Planning Commission may determine the location and size of
the driveway entrance (curb cut) to maximize safety and minimize impacts to
pedestrian and bicycle movement.
4.    Vehicular ingress and egress shall be from an alley, where one exists.
The second choice of access (if no alleys exist) shall be from the street with
less traffic, as determined by the Planning Commission. The third most
desirable access choice is collector streets, and arterial streets are the
fourth and least desirable choice for vehicular ingress and egress.
5.    Where there are significant changes in elevation, utilize topography to
reduce the visibility of parking from public areas and adjacent properties.
STRUCTURED PARKING
All projects must adhere to the following in the design of structured parking:
1.    Structured parking may not constitute the entire frontage of any street-
adjacent building. See Project Frontage for frontage requirements related to
structured parking.
2.    Locate structured parking to minimize visual impact to residences and
public streets. Ensure parking structures visible from public streets are arch
itecturally compatible with the main structure, and provide building and finish
elements that create visual interest to the streetscape.
3.   Where structured parking is adjacent to the sidewalk or within ten (10)
feet of the sidewalk edge, the facade shall incorporate a combination of
artwork, grillwork, special building material or other treatment/design that
enhances the pedestrian environment. Small setbacks with terraced landscaping
elements can be particularly effective in softening the appearance of
structured parking.
4.    Parking facilities shall be well-lit for safety with non-glare lighting
to reduce impacts to adjacent uses. See Lighting for lighting level standards.
5.    For single-family homes and duplexes, at least two (2) parking spaces are
required per dwelling unit. For multiple-family dwellings (three (3) or more
units), parking shall be provided as follows:
6.    At least one (1) parking space is required for each bedroom.
7.    At least one (1) bicycle parking space is required for every two (2)
units.
8.    With multiple-family dwellings, attached garages shall not face or open
towards a street. Attached garages associated with one and two-family dwellings
may face the street, but must be set back at least six (6) feet behind the
front facade.
9.    Enclosed garage parking spaces shall count towards no more than thirty
percent (30%) of the total number of required off-street parking spaces for
multiple-family dwellings (three (3) or more units).
III. PEDESTRIAN CIRCULATION
INTENT:
•    Provide convenient, safe and attractive pedestrian routes.
•    Increase social interaction.
FOR ALL PROJECTS:
1.    Pedestrian walks shall be separated from residential structures by at
least three (3) feet for landscaping. The Planning Commission may consider
other treatments to provide attractive pathways.
2.    Where not visible to the public (i.e., on the interior of the site), all
paths shall be a minimum of five (5) feet in width.
3.    Public pathways must be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA).
IV. SETBACKS AND PRIVACY
INTENT:
•    Provide privacy for residents, especially those immediately adjacent to
the proposed development.
•    Protect light and air access for residents of proposed development as well
as residents in adjacent existing structures.
FOR ALL PROJECTS:
Design project to reduce intrusion and impacts to adjacent and nearby
properties through meeting fill of the following:
1.    Offset window placement to avoid direct sightlines between living spaces.
2.    Orient courtyards and balconies to maximize privacy.
3.    Landscape all setbacks with a combination of landscape, hardscape or
other amenities.
4.    Shape upper levels to increase solar access, light, and air to adjacent
lower structures, on- and off-site open spaces, and adjoining residential land
uses.
FOR PROJECTS WITH LOT LINES ABUTTING AN EXISTING SINGLE-FAMILY ZONE:
Abutting an existing single-family zone: Provide an appropriate transition or
complement to adjacent single-family zones. Projects shall create a step in
perceived height, bulk or scale between the anticipated development potential
of the adjacent single-family zone and the the proposed development. This can
be done through any of the following:
1.    Increasing the distance from the building to the edge of the single-
family zone.
   a.    Set building back from interior or rear lot lines abutting single-
family zones a minimum of two (2) feet for every ten (10) feet in height.
2.    Providing shading or increased landscape buffer at the edge of a single-
family zone.
3.    Stepping back upper floors so building height/mass is less intense near
single-family zone.
4.    Matching the scale of adjacent single-family zone developments in
building detailing.
V. OPEN SPACE
INTENT:
•    Add to the livability of new residences.
•    Provide visual interest and relief.
•    Provide opportunities for outdoor activities.
•   Provide light and air in a new residential development.
•    Provide opportunities for social interaction.
FOR ALL PROJECTS
All projects must provide 150 square feet of on-site open space per dwelling
unit. Acceptable types of open space include:
1.    Common outdoor open space
   •    Where accessible to all residents, common outdoor open space may count
for up to one hundred percent (100%) of the required open space. Common outdoor
open space includes landscaped courtyards, shared decks, gardens with pathways,
children's play areas, pools, water features, accessible (unfenced) areas used
for stormwater retention or other multipurpose recreational or green spaces to
which all residents have access. Special requirements for common open spaces
include the following:
   •    Required setback areas shall not count toward the open space
requirement unless they are part of an open space that meets the other
requirements of common open space.
   •    Space shall have a minimum dimension of fifteen (15) feet in any
direction to provide functional leisure or recreational activity. This
dimension can be waived based on site conditions such as topography or
irregular lot geometry.
   •    Space shall feature paths or walkable areas, landscaping, seating,
lighting, play structures, sports courts or other pedestrian amenities to make
the area more functional and enjoyable for a range of users, taking into
consideration potential noise issues related to hard court sports such as
basketball, tennis and handball.
   •    Common space shall be separated from ground level windows, streets,
service areas and parking lots with landscaping, low-level decorative fencing
(no chain link), or other treatments as approved by the Planning Commission
that enhance safety and privacy for both the common open space and dwelling
units.
   •    The space shall be oriented to receive sunlight and preferably face
south, if possible. Open space may also face east or west, but not north,
unless the Planning Commission determines that site conditions such as
topography or irregular lot geometry warrant waiving this requirement.
   •    The space must be accessible from the dwelling units. Ideally, it
should be centrally located, if practical. The space must be oriented to
encourage activity from local residents.
2.    Balconies.
Individual balconies or patios (not including covered porches or stoops) may be
used for up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the required open space. To qualify
as open space, balconies or patios must be at least forty (40) square feet,
with no dimension less than five (5) feet.
3.   Rooftop decks and terraces.
Rooftop decks and terraces may be used to meet up to fifty percent (50%) of the
required open space, provided the following conditions are met:
   •   Space must be accessible to all dwelling units and ADA compliant.
   •   Space must provide amenities such as seating areas, barbeques,
fireplaces, recreational spaces, landscaping, etc.
   •    Space must feature surfacing which enables residents to use the open
space.
   •    Space must incorporate features that provide for the safety of
residents, such as appropriate lighting levels. See Safety and Security
4.   On-site indoor recreation areas
Indoor recreation areas may be used to meet up to twenty-five percent (25%) of
the required open space provided the following conditions are met:
   •    Space must be ADA accessible to all dwelling units.
   •    Space is designed for and includes equipment for recreational uses,
preferably for a range of users.
5.   Sensitive or critical areas
Sensitive areas shall only count toward open space requirements if integrated
into the site design to be visible and usable by residents with features such
as trails and benches. Sensitive or critical areas meeting these requirements
may count for up to fifty percent (50%) of the required open space, but only
the space utilized by the built amenities or trails, including a five (5) foot
radius around the amenities, shall be counted
VI. LIGHTING
INTENT:
•    Provide for personal safety and security.
•    Reduce the adverse impacts of lighting and retain dark skies.
FOR ALL PROJECTS
All publicly accessible areas and areas commonly used by residents shall be
lighted with levels as follows:
1.    Areas of low pedestrian activity such as service areas and vehicular
traffic areas: minimum 0.2 foot-candles (fc), maximum four (4) fc.
2.    Moderate or high volume pedestrian areas and building entries: minimum
one fc, maximum five fc, preferred average two (2) fc.
3.    Public parking lots: minimum one fc, maximum four (4) fc.
Additionally, all projects must meet the following:
1.    Lighting shall be provided at consistent levels, with an average lighting
level to minimum lighting level uniformity ratio no less than 3:1, to create
gradual transitions between varying levels of lighting and between lit areas
and unlit areas. Highly contrasting pools of light and dark areas shall be
avoided.
2.    Pedestrian lighting shall have a maximum height of fifteen (15) feet.
3.    Parking area lighting fixtures shall be fully shielded, dark sky rated
and mounted no more than twenty (20) feet above the ground, with lower fixtures
preferable so as to maintain a human scale.
4.    Steady, non-flashing lighting of building features, artwork and special
landscape elements may be allowed, subject to the findings of the Planning
Commission that the light causes no significant adverse impact.
5.    Provide lighting that complements the building and site design and
provides for safe pedestrian circulation and gathering places while minimizing
light spillage off-site.
VII. DUMPSTERS, UTILITIES AND SERVICE AREAS
INTENT:
•    Minimize the visual, auditory and olfactory impacts of waste handling,
storage areas, utilities and other similar facilities.
•    Allow for the efficient movement of utility functions and servicing of
buildings.
LOCATION AND DESIGN
The visual, auditory, and olfactory impacts of waste handling, storage areas,
utilities and similar activities and facilities shall be minimized. Reduce
impacts of refuse containers and storage areas through all of the following
measures:
1.    Service areas (loading docks, trash dumpsters, compactors, recycling
areas, electrical panels and mechanical equipment areas) shall be located to
avoid negative visual, auditory (noise), olfactory or physical impacts on the
street environment and adjacent residentially zoned properties. The Planning
Commission may require evidence that such elements will not significantly
impact neighboring properties or public areas. (For example, the Planning
Commission may require noise damping specifications for fans near residential
zones.) Service areas shall be sited for alley access if available.
2.    Service areas must not be visible from the sidewalk and adjacent
properties. Where the Planning Commission finds that the only option for
locating a service area is either visible from a public right-of-way or space
or from an adjacent property, the area must be screened with either landscape
or structural screening measures provided under "Screening" (below, this
section).
3.    Ground-mounted mechanical equipment must be located and screened to
minimize visual and noise impacts to pedestrians on streets and adjoining
properties.
4.    Roof-mounted mechanical equipment must be located and screened so the
equipment is not visible from the ground level of adjacent streets or
properties with in twenty (20) feet of the structure. Match the color of roof
mounted equipment with the exposed color of the roof to minimize visual impacts
when equipment is visible from higher elevations nearby.

IMAGES/0-0-0-4139_9489x3009.jpg]
5.    Locate and screen utility meters, electrical conduit and other service
and utilities apparatus so they are not visible from adjoining properties and
nearby streets.
6.    Other provisions of this section notwithstanding, service areas used by
residents shall be located to avoid entrapment areas and other conditions where
personal security would be compromised. The Planning Commission may require
pedestrian-scaled lighting or other measures to enhance security.
7.    Locate or shield noise producing mechanical equipment such as fans or
heat pumps to meet state law provisions
8.   All service connections and on-site utilities including wires and pipes
must be located underground. Meters may be attached to buildings. Project
proponents are required to coordinate with the local electric utility provider
to locate electrical service facilities in the least obtrusive way.
SCREENING
Where screening of service areas is called for (where impacts cannot be
adequately addressed through location or other means described above), adhere
to the following:
1.    A structural enclosure shall be constructed of masonry, heavy-gauge metal
or decay-resistant composite wood, and have a roof. The walls must be
sufficient to provide full screening from the affected roadway or use. The
enclosure may use overlapping walls to screen dumpsters and other materials.
Gates shall be made of heavy-gauge, sight-obscuring material, and the enclosure
shall be designed to be architecturally consistent and compatible with the
architectural concept for the site or building it serves.
2.    Collection points shall be located and configured so that the enclosure
gate swing does not obstruct pedestrian or vehicle traffic, or does not require
that a hauling truck project into any public right-of-way.
3.    The service area shall be paved.
4.    Weather protection of recyclables, trash and compost/yard waste shall be
ensured by using weather-proof containers or by providing a roof over the
storage area.
5.    In addition to the required screening, artwork such as paint schemes or
coverings that help to blend the equipment into the background may also be
utilized.
VIII. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
INTENT:
•    Provide a welcoming entry to residential buildings.
•    Provide a visually interesting roofline.
•    Achieve architectural scale that is compatible with the size and visual
massing of development envisioned within the zoning classification.
•    Add visual interest and sense of quality and craftsmanship to building
facades.
•    Enhance the pedestrian experience.
DEFINITIONS:
Architectural scale Perceived height and bulk of a building relative to that of
neighboring buildings or anticipated future neighboring developments. A
building has "good architectural scale" if its visual size is relatively
similar to development that is planned for in the zoning classification.
Modulation Stepping back or projecting forward of portions of a building face,
within specified intervals of building width and depth, as a means of breaking
up the apparent bulk of a structure's continuous exterior walls.
Articulation Visually enhancing a building facade by including features such as
broken rooflines, chimneys, entrances, distinctive window patterns.
BUILDING ENTRY DESIGN
Principal building entrances of all buildings shall feature all of the
following:
1.    A minimum of fifty (50) square feet of pedestrian weather protection.
Entries may satisfy this requirement by being set back into the building
facade.
2.    Lighting, to conform to Lighting
3.    Building or business name and address number.
4.   Transparency such as glass doors, windows or glazing (window area) near
the door so that the visitor and occupant can view people opening the door from
the other side (not required for individual unit entries leading directly to a
single dwelling).
5.    Security, to the extent feasible. Entries must be visible from areas with
high pedestrian activity.
6.    Architectural or artwork enhancements, including one or more of the
following:
   a.    Ornamental doors or windows,
   b.    Ornamental paving or materials (e.g., decorative tile work),
   c.    Distinctive architectural lighting,
   d.    Artwork,
   e.    Landscaping, or
   f.    Adjacent usable open space.
ROOFLINE CHARACTER
All projects must provide a roofline design that fits with the character of the
building and provides some level of visual interest. The upper level or top of
the building should have a considered (intentional) treatment. This may be done
in any of the following ways:
1.    Design a shaped, sloped, pitched or varied roof form -visible to
passersby from public areas including highways or other distant views.
2.    Provide cornice expressions, eyebrows, overhangs, horizontal projections.
3.    Increase variety of building massing at upper levels to establish
contrast with overall bulk and mass of lower levels.
4.    Incorporate extensions (chimneys, turrets, towers, skylights,
clerestories - if logical continuation of architecture).
5.    Utilize other height variations to complement adjacent structures.
Avoid superfluous or tack-on roof features such as mansard roof extensions,
roof signs or roof ribs.
FACADE MODULATION AND BULK/MASS DESIGN.
All new buildings over three (3) stories, over 5,000 square feet in gross
building footprint or with facades longer than 100 feet measured horizontally
along a public right-of-way or visible from a public right-of-way shall provide
at least three (3) major modulation or articulation features as described below
along any facade that is visible from a public right-of-way, residential zone
or pedestrian pathway. The "articulation interval" at which the repetitive
element repeats should not be greater than fifty (50) feet.
1.    Horizontal building modulation. Horizontal modulation is the stepping
back or extending forward of building stories or horizontal building elements.
To satisfy this requirement through horizontal modulation, the depth (extension
out or set back from the building facade) of the modulation must be at least
two (2) feet when tied to a change in the roofline and at least five (5) feet
in other situations. Balconies may be used to qualify for this option, provided
they have a floor area of at least forty (40) square feet, are integrated with
the architecture of the building, and project at least two (2) feet from the
building facade. Step backs of upper stories are a common form of horizontal
modulation.
2.   Vertical building modulation. Vertical modulation is the extension or
stepping back of vertical elements of a building. In order to satisfy this
guideline through vertical modulation, the minimum depth of modulation is
eighteen (18) inches and minimum width for each modulation is fifteen (15)
feet. Balconies may not be used to meet this modulation option unless they are
recessed or projected from the facade and integrated with the building's
architecture as determined by the Planning Commission.
3.    Modulated roofline. Buildings may qualify for this option by modulating
the roof line of all facades visible from a street, park or pedestrian pathway
consistent with the following standards:
   a.    For flat roofs or facades with a horizontal fascia (the board at the
end of a roof eave or cornice) or parapet, change the roofline so that there is
a change of the roofline at least every sixty (60) feet. Minimum vertical
dimension of roof line modulation is two (2) feet.
   b.    For gable, hipped or shed roofs, a slope of at least three (3) feet
vertical to twelve (12) feet horizontal is required to meet the guideline.
   c.    Other roof forms such as arched, vaulted, dormer or saw-toothed may
satisfy this design standard if the individual segments of the roof with no
change in slope or discontinuity are less than sixty (60) feet in width
(measured horizontally).
4.    Repeating distinctive window patterns at intervals less than the
articulation interval.
5.    Providing a porch, patio, deck or covered entry for each articulation
interval.
6.    Changing the roofllne by alternating dormers, stepped roofs, gables, or
changing roof textures on certain features such as metal roofs on towers and
dormers to reinforce the modulation or articulation interval.
7.   Changing materials with a change in building plane.
8.    Providing lighting fixtures, trellises, trees or other landscape feature
within each interval.
9.    Creating open-to-the-sky courtyards and terraces that break the building
facade.
10.    Incorporating projections such as:
   a.    Window bays
   b.    Porch additions
   c.    Stair enclosures
   d.    Chimneys
   e.    Balconies
   f.    Recesses at windows, entries, doors or other openings
   g.    Minor projecting masses
11.    Using materials and colors to emphasize major or minor architectural
scales, to introduce sense of detail and create distinctions between
structures.
The Planning Commission may increase or decrease the sixty (60)-foot interval
for modulation and articulation to better match surrounding structures or to
implement an adopted subarea plan.
IX. ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS
INTENT:
•    Add visual interest to building appearance.
•    Enhance the pedestrian experience.
•    Contribute to the public's perception of the City of Heath as a desirable
place to live through showing care and craftsmanship in design.
FOR ALL PROJECTS
All new buildings shall include on the facades that face a public right-of-way
at least three (3) of the following design features:
1.    Distinctive roofline treatments, such as an ornamental molding, or other
roofline device visible from the ground level.
2.    Special treatment of windows and doors, other than standard metal
molding/framing details, around all ground floor windows and doors, decorative
glazing or door designs.
3.    Decorative building materials, such as decorative masonry, shingle, brick
or stone.
4.    Individualized patterns or continuous wood details, such as fancy butt
shingles (a shingle with the butt end machined in some pattern, typically to
form geometric designs), decorative moldings, brackets, trim or lattice work,
ceramic tile, stone or similar materials. The applicant must submit
archiectural drawings and material samples for approval.
5.    Use of green walls, planter boxes, landscaped trellises, wall trellises,
decorative or special railings, grill work, landscape guards or specially
designed canopies, as an integral part of the building's design.
6.    Decorative artwork, which may be freestanding or attached to the building
and may be in the form of mosaic mural, bas-relief sculpture, light sculpture,
water sculpture, fountain, free standing sculpture, art in pavement or other
similar artwork. Painted murals or graphics on signs or awnings do not qualify.
7.    Special building elements, such as pilasters, entablatures, wainscots,
canopies or marquees that exhibit nonstandard designs.
RESIDENTIAL WINDOW DETAILS
The facades of residential buildings shall employ techniques to recess or
project individual windows above the ground floor at least two (2) inches from
the facade or incorporate window trim at least four (4) inches in width that
features color that contrasts with the base building color.

X. MATERIALS
INTENT:
•    Help ensure the quality and maintainability of new development.
•    Help ensure attractiveness of new buildings.
FOR ALL PROJECTS
1.    The following are allowed only with special detailing, as described
below:
   a.    Metal siding. When used as a siding material over more than twenty-
five percent (25%) of a building's facade visible from a public area, metal
siding must:
      i.    Have a matte finish in neutral or earth tone such as buff, gray,
beige, tan, cream, white, or a dulled color, such as barn-red, blue-gray,
burgundy, ochre.
      ii.    Include two (2) or more of the following elements:
         1.    Visible window and door trim painted or finished in a
complementary color.
         2.    Color and edge trim that cover exposed edges of the sheet metal
panels.
         3.    A base of masonry, stone or other approved permanent material
extending up to at least two (2) feet above grade that is durable. (The intent
is to provide more durable materials near grade level.)
   b.    Concrete block walls. Concrete block construction used over twenty-
five percent (25%) of a building facade visible from a public area must be
architecturally treated in one or more of the following ways:
      i.    Use of textured blocks with surfaces such as split face or grooved.
      ii.    Use of other masonry types, such as brick, glass block or tile in
conjunction with concrete blocks.
      iii.    Use of decorative coursing to break up blank wall areas.
      iv.    Use of matching colored mortar where color is an element of
architectural treatment for any of the options above.
   c.    Requirements for stucco, stucco-like and similar troweled finishes:
      i.    To avoid deterioration, the finish material must be trimmed or
sheltered from extreme weather by roof overhangs or other methods.
      ii.    The finish material may only be used in conjunction with other
approved building materials.
2.    Any material that is subject to damage and deterioration from human
contact or landscape elements is prohibited within two (2) vertical feet of the
sidewalk or ground level or in areas that are especially subject to vandalism
such as areas with low visibility. In these areas, a more durable finish
material such as brick, concrete or concrete block shall be used.
3.    Use of flat sheet materials such as fiber cement panels (e.g., Hardie
Panel) is not allowed on ground floor facades. This is because the panels do
not provide human scale surfaces or textures or refined details. Textured
panels on ground floors may be approved by the Planning Commission if they are
detailed not to appear as a panelized system.
4.   Prohibited materials for exterior of buildings (excluding special art
features):
   a.    Mirrored glass.
   b.    Vinyl siding.
   c.    Corrugated fiberglass.
   d.    Chain link fencing within fifty (50) feet of a building's public
entrance (except for temporary purposes such as a construction site).
   e.    Crushed colored rock or tumbled glass.
   f.    Any sheet materials, such as wood or metal siding, with exposed edges
or unfinished edges.
   g.    Any spray-on materials (e.g.: shot-crete) not specifically approved by
the Planning Commission.
   h.    Non-durable materials subject to deterioration if exposed to weather
such as most plastic and synthetic materials or materials that are particularly
vulnerable to vandalism. Project aplicants wishing to use synthetic materials
must submit samples and product description information to the Planning
Commission for approval. The Planning Commission will not accept such materials
unless its durability and appropriateness is demonstrated.
      (3)   Uses.
         A.   Permitted Uses.
            1.    Two Family Dwellings
            2.   Three Family Dwellings
            3.   Multi-Family Dwellings
         B.   Conditional Uses. Conditional Uses listed at Section
1165.03 (a) and (c).
         C.   Accessory Uses. Any accessory use or structure customarily
incident or accessory to a principal or conditionally permitted use in this
Zone 2.
      (4)   Development Plan Approval. Prior to development of a lot or a
Development (as defined below) the owner and/or developer shall submit a
Development Plan to the Planning Commission to be reviewed at a public hearing.
Within thirty (30) days after the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall
approve the Development Plan if it is in accordance with these Zone 2
requirements including the Overlay Standards or, if the Planning Commission
determines the Development Plan is not in accordance with these Zone 2
requirements, it will provide the applicant a written list of issues that need
addressed to bring the Development Plan into conformance with these Zone 2
requirements. Submittal of a revised Development Plan to bring it into
conformance with these Zone 2 requirements may occur at any time after its non-
approval and as many times as needed to bring the Development Plan into
conformance with these Zone 2 requirements. An approved Development Plan will
terminate five (5) years from the date of its approval if construction has not
physically been initiated on the property. The approval and denial of a
Development Plan shall not be considered an amendment to the Zoning Resolution
but is subject to appeal pursuant to Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (5)   General Development Standards.
         A.   Density and Minimum Lot Sizes. The total maximum number of
dwelling units (DU) permitted per acre shall be calculated by multiplying the

1136.01 FINDINGS.
   Council finds that changes in land use and zoning classification resulting
from the sprawl of urbanization has often necessitated the removal of trees and
other valuable natural resources and often has the effect of degrading the
appearance, character and value of existing land use patterns within and
surrounding the City.
(Ord. 40-98. Passed 8-17-98.)
1136.02 PURPOSES.
   The purposes of this chapter are to protect and promote the public health,
safety and general welfare by fully utilizing the benefits of landscaping in
new development to ensure that the local stock of native trees is replenished;
to contribute to the process of air purification, oxygen regeneration, ground
water recharge and storm water run-off retardation, while at the same time
aiding in noise, glare and heat abatement; to buffer uncomplimentary and often
incompatible land uses by providing a transitional interface; to assist in
controlling traffic to and from, as well as within, off-street parking
facilities by limiting the internal movement of vehicles and pedestrians to
designated traffic configurations; to relieve the blighted appearance of
parking lots; and to otherwise facilitate the creation of a pleasant
environment.
(Ord. 40-98. Passed 8-17-98.)
 
1136.03 INTENT; APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   (a)    The intent of this chapter is to:
      (1)    Encourage landscape development in publicly and privately
developed land use areas, except agricultural zones, not including commercial
applications in agricultural zones such as airports, landfills, junk yards or
other uses as determined by the Planning Commission;
      (2)    Foster a community-wide reforestation program;
       (3)    Require the installation and maintenance of landscape planting
areas in off- street parking facilities and other vehicle use areas;
      (4)    Require the installation and maintenance of landscape planting
areas in uncomplimentary land uses and zones herein set forth;
       (5)    Encourage the planting of the highest quality landscape materials
for multi- family residential, commercial and industrial properties, public
streets, public places and parks, located within the City's corporation limits.
      (6)    Require the installation and maintenance of landscape planting
areas adjacent to building structures.
   (b)    All new development, construction or reconstruction shall be in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter within one calendar year from
the date of completion of construction. Where a building permit has been issued
prior to the effective date of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter
shall not apply. Where a development, construction, or reconstruction project
involves only a portion of the total property (i.e.: building addition) that
portion will be required to comply with the provisions of this chapter. If said
development, construction or reconstruction exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the
assessed valuation of such structure prior to the project as shown on the most
recent tax appraisal of the County Auditor then it shall be required to comply
with this chapter for the entire property.
   (c)    Where there is a change of use in an existing building with a parking
area between the street and building setback line, the property shall be
required to comply with the provisions of this chapter and submit plans for
review before the Planning Commission.

   (a)    This chapter defines the minimum requirements that shall be met in
regard to perimeter landscaping for noncompatible land use areas, landscaping
for service areas and interior landscaping for business, buildings, structures
or other new developments of the land.
   (b)    Vehicular use areas shall not be constructed, enlarged or
reconstructed in the City until a landscape plan has been approved by the
Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall not give approval to any
landscape plan submitted to them pursuant to this section unless it conforms to
the requirements of this chapter. Landscape plans submitted pursuant to this
chapter shall be submitted as part of the site plan submittals required for a
building permit pursuant to the Zoning Code. Landscape plans submitted pursuant
to this chapter shall be drawn to scale, including dimensions and distances,
and clearly delineate any existing and proposed parking spaces or other
vehicular use areas, access aisles, driveways and their location. The plan
shall clearly identify size and description of all landscaping materials
including locations of existing trees.
   (c)    Change of Use for Single Use Structures. All existing non-complying
parking areas and/or drive aisles will be required to comply with the
provisions of this chapter, as outlined in Section
1136.06. All existing non-complying structures will be required to comply with
provisions of this chapter, as outlined in Section
1136.09. All existing non-complying service structures will be required to

will be determined by the portion (percent of total structure square footage)
that use or tenant occupies (i.e.: if said tenant occupies 20% of total
structure, 20% of required landscape material will be installed). The landscape
material shall be installed at the time of the change of use. Where possible,
appropriate landscape setbacks shall be permanently established.
(Ord. 40-98. Passed 8-17-98.)
1136.06 STANDARDS FOR OFF-STREET PARKING FACILITIES AND VEHICULAR USE AREAS.
   Public and private off-street parking facilities and other vehicular use
areas shall be landscaped in accordance with the following requirements.
   (a)    Frontage Along Public Streets.
       (1)    For parking lots up to 7,000 square feet and/or including less
than twenty- five cars. The setback for off-street car parking facilities is
determined by three development options as shown on Exhibit 'A-1' (Frontage
Landscaping Requirements for Off-Street Surface Parking Lots). Option 'A'
requires a 10'-0" minimum parking and/or drive aisle set-back with a continuous
3'-0" height evergreen hedge. Option 'B' requires a 20'-0" minimum parking and/
or drive aisle set-back with a continuous 3' 0" height minimum earthen mound.
In addition to these requirements of the zoning Code, one 2" minimum caliper
large or medium class tree is to be planted for each 35 feet of frontage.
      (2)    For parking lots exceeding 7,000 square feet or twenty-five cars.
The set- back for off-street car parking facilities is determined by three
development options as shown on Exhibit 'A-2' (Frontage Landscaping
Requirements for Off-Skeet Surface Parking Lots). Option 'A' requires a 15'-0"
minimum parking lot and/or drive aisle set-back with a continuous 3'-0" height
evergreen hedge. Option 'B' requires a 25'-0" minimum parking and/or drive
aisle set-back with a continuous 3'-0" height minimum earthen mound. In
addition to these requirements of the Zoning Code, one 3" minimum caliper large
or medium class tree is to be planted for each 35 feet of frontage.
      (3)    For truck vehicular use areas and parking. The set-back for off-
street truck parking facilities is as shown on Exhibit 'A-3' (Frontage
Landscaping Requirements for Off-Street Surface Parking Lots). Truck parking,
loading areas and drive aisles require a 45'-0" minimum parking and/or drive
aisle set-back with a continuous 6'-0" height minimum earthen mound. In
conjunction with this requirement three (3) staggered rows of 8'-0" height
minimum evergreen trees at 20'-0" maximum spacing and two (2) 10'-0" height
small class trees per each 100 lineal feet of frontage are to be planted.
    (b)    Rear and Side Yards Adjacent Compatible Use Districts. The set-back
shall be 10'-0" minimum for car parking and/or drive aisles and 20'-0" minimum
for truck parking and/or drive aisles, as shown in Exhibit 'B- l'. In addition
to these requirements of the Zoning Code, one 2" minimum caliper large or
medium class tree is to be planted for each 35 lineal feet of property line for
all vehicular use areas. If evergreen trees are preferred in lieu of large or
medium class trees, the evergreen trees are to be 6'-0" minimum height and one
tree is to be planted for each 20 lineal feet of property line. Truck vehicular
use areas are to have a 6'-0" height minimum evergreen tree planted for every
20 lineal feet of property line.
    (c)    Rear and Side Yards Adjacent Incompatible Use Districts. The set-
back for off- street car and truck parking facilities is determined by two
development options for cars and a specific requirement for trucks as shown in
Exhibit 'B-2' (Side and Rear Yard Landscaping Requirement for Off-Street
Parking Lots). Option 'A' for cars requires a 20'-0" minimum parking and/or
drive aisle set-back with a continuous 6'-0" height wall. The wall shall be
constructed of brick decorative cut block stone and shall be maintenance free
as approved by the City. In addition to this requirement 8'-0" height evergreen
trees at 20'-0" maximum spacing and two (2) 2" caliper minimum small class
trees per each 100 lineal feet of property line are to be planted. Option 'B'
for cars requires a 30'-0" minimum parking and/or drive aisle set-back with a
continuous 4'-0" height minimum earthen mound. In addition to the mounding
requirements a double staggered row of 8'-0" height minimum evergreen trees at
20'-0" maximum spacing and two (2) 2" caliper minimum small class trees per
each 100 lineal feet of property line are to be planted. Truck vehicular areas
require a 45'-0" minimum parking and/or drive aisle set-back with a continuous
6'-0" height minimum earthen mound. In addition to the mounding requirement
three (3) staggered rows of 8'-0" height minimum evergreen trees at 20'-0"
maximum spacing and two (2) 2" caliper minimum small class trees per each 100
lineal feet of property line are to be planted.
   (d)    Interior Vehicular Use Areas. Within interior vehicular use areas
peninsulas, island, aisle end islands, and planting areas are to be constructed
for landscape plantings as shown on Exhibit 'C' (Interior Landscaping
Requirements for Off- Street Surface Parking Lots). Each peninsula, island,
aisle end island, or planting area is to contain at least one (1) 2" minimum
caliper small or medium class tree. Islands, peninsulas, aisle end islands, and
planting areas are to be located at intervals not to exceed fifteen (15)
parking spaces. All parking aisles are to be terminated with an end island or
planting bed. Peninsulas, islands, and aisle end islands are to be minimum
sizes of eight feet (8') in width and thirty-six feet (36') in length, or eight
feet (8') in width and eighteen feet (18') in length, as shown on Exhibit 'C'.
      (1)    In order that there shall be safe access to parking spaces, eight
feet (8') landscaped strips shall be arranged so as to divide parking corridors
and to limit "cross tracing" through open parking spaces.
       (2)    To minimize traffic hazards, when an access way intersects a
public right- of-way or when the property abuts the intersection of two or more
rights- of-way, all landscaping shall provide unobstructed cross visibility at
a level between three feet and six feet.
       (3)    Grass or other ground cover shall be planted on all portions of
the interior planting area not occupied by other landscape material.
       (4)    The minimum distance from a tree to a vehicular use area shall be
four feet measured from the face of the tree. Vehicles may overhang a
landscaped area not more than two and one-half feet when parked head-in to a
landscaped area in a marked parking space. The overhang distance may be counted
as part of the required depth of each parking space.
      (5)    Airport facilities adjacent to commercial or residential areas
must install landscaping as described in Exhibit 'B-2' (Option 2-Incompatible
Land Use).
         (Ord. 40-98. Passed 8-17-98.)
1136.07 LANDSCAPE BUFFER RELATING TO UNCOMPLIMENTARY LAND USES AND ZONES.
   Except as provided in Section 1175.09 of the City of Heath Zoning
Ordinances, where it is determined that as a result of new developments,
construction or reconstruction uncomplimentary or incompatible land uses or
zones are created, a continuous eighty percent (80%) opaque landscape hedge,
wall or earthen mound visual screen, in addition to screening of vehicular use
area provisions, shall be provided.
(Ord. 15-2020. Passed 5-18-20.)
1136.08 SCREENING OF SERVICE STRUCTURES.
   Service structures, including, but not limited to, propane tanks, trash
dumpsters, electrical transformers, air conditioners/cooling towers, heat
pumps, utility vaults which extend above grade, and other equipment or elements
providing service to a building or site, are to be screened in all zoning
districts. A contiguous one hundred percent (100%) opaque landscape hedge,
solid fence, wall, or earthen mound is required to enclose any service
structure on all exposed sides. If such structure is frequently moved (i.e.:
trash dumpster) all but one side is required to be screened. Screening shall be
one foot (l'-0") higher than service structure but shall not be required to
exceed 8'-0" in height (6'-0" height for walls and fences). Provide 24" height
minimum plantings at 5'-0" maximum spacing around the enclosed portion of the
perimeter screen. Curbing and/or bollards are to be installed around any trash
disposal or waste collection unit a minimum of 2'-0" within the screening
material to prevent damage to the screening when the container is moved or
emptied.
(Ord. 40-98. Passed 8-17-98.)
1136.09 OTHER PLANTING REQUIREMENTS.

1168.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this District is to provide areas for the development of
moderate-to high-density residential uses and structures in moderately spacious
surroundings. It is the intent of this chapter that these Districts be located
in the suburban and intermediate portions of the City where a protected
environment suitable for moderate-density residential use can be provided, as
well as in established moderate-density residential areas as a means to ensure
their continuance. However, the use of this District is appropriate on a
smaller scale in the surburban portions of the City as a transitional or buffer
zone between low-density residential districts and commercial districts,
industrial districts, or major transportation arteries, or other uses that are
not compatible with a low-density residential environment. In fulfilling the
purpose of this District, the townhouse or rowhouse concept may be used which
permits the construction of dwellings immediately adjacent to one another
without side yards between the individual units. This concept permits better
use of the entire lot by compacting the usual front, rear and side yards into
one or more internal gardens which may be completely walled in or screened.
(Ord. 112-86. Passed 1-19-86.)
1168.02 PERMITTED USES.
   (a)   Any and all uses permitted in R-2 Districts, except as restricted in
Section
1168.04.
   (b)   Townhouse dwellings.
   (c)   Zero lot line dwellings.
(Ord. 112-86. Passed 1-19-86.)
1168.03 CONDITIONAL USES.
   Same as R-2 District. (Ord. 112-86. Passed 1-19-86.)
1168.04 PROHIBITED USES.
   Single-family dwellings. (Ord. 112-86. Passed 1-19-86.)
1168.05 TOWNHOUSES AND ZERO LOT LINE DWELLINGS NOT PART OF A TRACT DEVELOPMENT.

zero lot line houses, except that for corner lots the minimum shall be thirty-
four feet for townhouses and fifty feet for zero lot line dwellings.
   (c)   Minimum front yard depth: ten feet except that where the building
fronts on a dedicated street and/or is adjacent to an R-1, R-1-S or R-

be built closer than ten feet to the lot line of a lot that is zoned R-1, R-1-
S, or R-2 Residential.
   (e)   Minimum rear yard depth: twenty feet for townhouses and zero lot line
dwellings. Such space may be used for parking purposes and open carports; forty

maintained common open space, a townhouse or zero lot line dwelling including
accessory structures shall not occupy more than fifty percent (50%) of the lot
area.
   (h)   A maximum of eight living units shall be allowed in each row of
townhouses. When an end unit of a rowhouse does not side on a street, an open
space or court of at least twenty feet in width shall be provided between it
and the adjacent row of townhouses, and this open space shall be divided
between the two immediately adjacent townhouse lots as to property or lot
lines.
   (i)   Where townhouse lots and dwelling units are designed to face upon an
open or common access court rather than upon a street, this open court shall be
a minimum of forty feet in width and such court shall not include vehicular
drives or parking areas.
   (j)   Townhouses shall be constructed up to side lot lines, without side
yards, and no windows, doors or other openings shall face a side lot line
except that the outside wall of end units may contain such openings.
   (k)   Regulations for conventional family dwellings shall be the same as in
the R-2 Residential District, except as restricted in Section
1168.04.
   (l)   All surface drainage must be approved by the Zoning Department.

other zoning districts and shall serve as a guide to the design process, and
shall be used by the Planning Commission in approving site plans within this
district.
   (b)    Building Entrances. Entryway design elements and variations shall
provide orientation, aesthetically pleasing character, and pedestrian scale to
the building. These elements shall be architecturally integrated with the
building and create the appearance of multiple entrances and storefronts. Each
principal building shall have clearly defined, highly visible customer entrance
(s) featuring an appropriate combination of two or more of the following:
      (1)    Overhangs
      (2)    Recesses/projections
       (3)    Verandas
       (4)    Arches
       (5)    Landscaped areas for pedestrian seating
       (6)    Architectural details such as tile work and moldings which are
integrated into the building structure and design.
      (7)    Outdoor patios/public plazas with seating
      (8)    Peaked roof forms
       (9)    Canopies (not backlit) or porticos
   (c)    Aesthetic Character. Facades shall be articulated to reduce the
massive scale and the uniform, disengaging appearances of retail buildings, and
to provide visual interest that will be consistent with the community's
identity, character, and scale. Composite shapes shall be utilized in the site
layout of large structures. The intent is to require developments to
incorporate high quality materials and a pedestrian friendly scale so as to
contribute to and identify a sense of community as articulated in the Master
Plan. The following standards shall be applied to accomplish these goals.
      (1)    No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed seventy-five
(75) horizontal feet, and wall plan projections or offsets shall have a depth
of at least ten (10) feet and shall extend at least thirty (30) feet of the
length of the facade.
      (2)    No segment of wall shall exceed ten (10) vertical feet without
interruption by an architectural feature such as a change in color, texture,
material, design, etc.; and
      (3)    Ground floor facades that face public streets or parking areas
shall have display windows, awnings, verandas, entry areas, or other such
features along no less than sixty percent (60%) of their horizontal length.
   (d)    Building Features. Buildings shall have architectural features,
finishes, and patterns that provide visual interest, contribute to a pedestrian
scale, reduce massive effects, and recognize local, as well as community-wide
character. The elements in the following standard shall be integral parts of
the building fabric, and not superficially applied trim, graphics, or paint.
      (1)    Building facades shall incorporate a repeating pattern that
includes the elements listed below. At least one of these elements shall repeat
horizontally. The elements are as follows:
         A.   Color
         B.   Texture
         C.   Material
         D.   Reveals
         E.   Offsets
         F.   Columns
         G.   Pilasters
       (2)    Expression of architectural or structural bay through a change in
plane is recommended. The following are examples of such expressions:
         A.   Offsets
         B.   Projecting ribs or columns
         C.   Recessed arches or other features
   (e)    Roofs. Variations in roof lines shall be used to reduce the mass and
add interest to large buildings. The lenth of a continuous stretch of roof
shall not exceed 75 fet without a change in pitch, roof level or parapet height
to break up the roof massing. Flat roofs shall not be visible, except if
verandas, trellises, etc. are utilized. Roof features shall complement the
character of adjoining neighborhoods and/or developments where applicable. All
rooftop mechanical equipment must be screened from public view and the
enclosure shall be designed to meet a minimum STC rating of 35, using materials
and designs appropriate for the noise pitch. Parapets will feature three-
dimensional cornice treatment. Parapet backing, if visible, must match the
materials of the front elevation of the parapet. Roofs shall incorporate at
least two of the following features:
      (1)    Overhanging eaves, extending no less than three (3) feet past the
supporting walls.
       (2)    Sloping roofs that do not exceed the average height of the
supporting walls, which utilize trusses and pillars.
      (3)    Multiple horizontal roof planes per building elevation.
   (f)    Building Materials and Colors. Building materials shall be of high
quality. It is the applicant's responsibility to demonstrate that materials,
systems, and their supporting connections, enclosures, joints, joint materials,
ability to expand and contract, ability to maintain color and finish, long term
durability and maintenance meet or exceed acceptable industry standards as
accepted by the Planning Commission. The applicant shall provide all
appropriate data, samples, and warranty information. The Planning Commission
will consider new products, systems, and technologies, but retains discretion
over their issue.
   The use of brick or stone (including limestone and manufactured stone) is
significant in the development’s community-wide acceptability and contextual
appearance. Therefore, one or oth materials shall be utilized on every building
facade. A minimum of 60 percent of every building front facade must be standard
or utility sized brick or natural stone. Split face concrete block is not
considered brick or stone and thus may not be used to meet the 60 percent
requirement; however, it may be used for the remaining 40 percent. Other
facades must have a minimum of thirty percent (30%) brick or stone. This
required percentage may be increased if the development location warrants it.
   Definitions.
   “Brick” means ceramic structural material that is made by pressing clay into
blocks and firing them to the requisite hardness in a kiln.
   “Stonework” means natural stone that has been quarried, cut, dressed and
finished.
   “C.M.U.” means structural masonry made by mixing broken stone or gravel with
sand, cement and water and allowing the mixture to harden in a solid mass.
   The following materials are not acceptable:
      (1)    Standard concrete masonry units, such as concrete block, painted
or unpainted, other than textured (split face) block.
      (2)    Vinyl or aluminum siding
      (3)    Wood siding and trim other than cedar
   Tinting of glazing and the percentage of facade area devoted to glazing are
both subject to review and approval by the Planning Commission.
   Building materials and colors must contribute to the visual impact of a
building. Therefore, they should be aesthetically pleasing and compatible with
materials and colors used throughout the community. These shall be subdued low
chroma colors, including grey, buff, beige, taupe, brown, and tan. "Corporate
identity" or "logo" colors may not be used in any material colors unless they
coincide with accepted colors. Business "logo colors" may be used sparingly in
signage.
   Facade and trim colors shall be of low reflectance, subtle, and neutral
colors. The use of high intensity colors, metallic colors, black, or
fluorescent colors is prohibited. Painted stripes or designs shall be avoided.
Exposed neon tubing on the building is subject to review and approval by the
Planning Commission.
   (g)    Rear and Side Facades. No structure is considered as having "front"
and "rear" facades. The same quality of finish shall be utilized on all sides
of the building. All facades will contribute to the scale and features of the
building by featuring similar characteristics as the front facade.
   (h)    Miscellaneous Requirements. Loading areas and outdoor storage areas
of large format retailers exert visual and noise impacts on surrounding areas.
All of these areas must be completely screened or enclosed. Standards for these
areas are summarized in the following:
      (1)    Storage, sales, truck parking, trash collection/compaction,
loading, or other such uses must be fully screened.
      (2)    Storage, sales, trash collection/compaction, loading, or other
such uses shall be located at least thirty-five (35) feet from a public street,
public sidewalk, or internal pedestrian way, public or private.
      (3)    Loading docks, truck parking, storage, utility meters, HVAC
equipment, trash collection/compaction, and other service functions shall be
incorporated into the overall design of the building and the landscaping. The
visual and noise impacts of these functions shall be fully contained/enclosed
and out of view from adjacent properties and public/private streets. Attention
shall not be attracted to these functions by the use of screening or building
materials different from or inferior to the principal materials of the building
and landscapes.
       (4)    No delivery, loading, trash removal, or other such operations
should be permitted between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. when any part
of the site is within five hundred (500) feet of residential uses. Trash
collection containers shall have top enclosures. Violations of these policies
will be handled by the Heath Police Department and the Code Enforcement
Officer.

requirements:
   (a)   Screening and Landscaping. Off-street parking areas for more than five
vehicles shall be effectively screened on each side which adjoins premises
situated in any R District by a masonry wall or solid fence of acceptable
design. Such wall or fence shall be between four and six feet in height and
shall be maintained in good condition. Landscaping provided in lieu of such
wall or fence shall consist of a strip of land not less than fifteen feet in
width planted with an evergreen hedge, or dense planting of evergreen shrubs
not less than four feet in height.
   (b)   Surfacing. Any off-street parking area for more than five vehicles
shall be graded for proper drainage and surfaced so as to provide a durable and
dustless surface.
   (c)   Lighting. Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking area
shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining premises in
any R District. All types of illumination shall be shaded or concealed so that
the light will not interfere with the vision of motor vehicle operators or
shine directly on residential property nor flash or simulate movement.
   (d)   Joint Use of Parking Areas. Parking spaces may be located on a lot
other than that containing the principal use with approval of the Board
provided a written agreement, approved by the City Solicitor and accepted by
Council, shall be filed with the application for a zoning permit.
   (e)   Parking Area Modifications. The Board may authorize on appeal a
modification, reduction or waiver of the foregoing requirements, if it should
find that, in the particular case appealed, the peculiar nature of the
residential, business, trade, industrial or other use, or the exceptional shape
or size of the property or other exceptional situation or condition would
justify such action. No action shall be taken by the Board unless and until it
has first received the recommendation of the Planning Commission regarding the
appeal. Additional green space may be substituted for parking spaces in
reserve.
   (f)   Aisle. An aisle is that portion of the circulation area within a
parking lot, excluding the driveway, that provides accessibility to parking,
stacking or loading spaces. An aisle to serve adjacent loading spaces shall
have a minimum width fifteen feet. No part of the loading space may be inlcuded
in this calculation.
      The minimium width permissible for an aisle to serve adjacent parking
spaces shall depend on the smallest angle of parking as measured between the
centerline of the aisle and the centerline of the adjacent parking space as
illustrated.
 
Angle of Parking              Minimum Aisle Width
80' degree or more            20 feet - two way travel
Less than 80' but 50' or more 17 feet - one way travel
Less than 50'                 13 feet - one way travel
0' or parallel parking        13 feet - one way travel

1187.10 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
   (a)   Illumination. Illumination of signs shall be permitted in all
districts. Illumination shall be from a concealed or indirect light source and
shall not flash, blink, fluctuate, travel, move or in any manner fail to
provide constant illumination and shall not create a hazard or visibility
problem or interfere with or impair vehicular movement on any street from which
the sign may be viewed. Illuminated signs shall be constructed and maintained
so that the source of illumination is shielded or otherwise prevented from the
beaming directly onto adjacent properties or streets.
(Ord. 27-01. Passed 9-4-01.)
   (b)   Animated, mechanical, and digital signs and billboards.
      (1)   Purpose and intent. The intent of this subsection is to provide
standards allowing utilization of specific types of mechanical moving signs and
billboards and digital signs and billboards that create digital images that are
changed every few seconds by computers. The purpose of the standards is to
protect residential areas from exposure to light and motion sequences involving
lighted messages that exceed those of existing signage, and manage, for safety
purposes, the exposure of motorists to excessive distractions caused by visual
displays adjacent to roadways.
      (2)   Time-and-temperature and digital signs. 
         A.   Time-and-temperature signs: Single line electronic time and
temperature signs are allowed. All other types of mechanical or electronic
changeable copy signs, flashing signs, moving signs and animation signs are
prohibited, except as provided herein.
         B.   Digital signs:
            1.   Number. No more than one digital sign is allowed per site
unless it is a multi-tenant location with 750 feet or more of road frontage.
            2.   Size. Lighted display surfaces shall not exceed 32 square feet
for single-tenant sites or for multi-tenant sites having less than 200 feet of
road frontage. Multi-tenant sites having more than 200 feet of road frontage
may have digital signs with lighted display surfaces of up to 100 square feet
in area. The entire sign must conform to the height, size, setback, and
location requirements currently established for respective zoning district.
            3.   Style and brightness. The restriction applicable to digital
billboards listed in Sections
1187.10(b)(4)(c) and (d) shall apply to digital signs.
            4.   Location. Digital signs are prohibited everywhere except in
the B-3, M-1, and M-2 Zoning Districts. Whenever a proposed digital sign site
is adjacent to a residential property or a residential district, approval of
the Board of Zoning and Building Appeals is required.
            5.   Conversion of nonconforming signs. Whenever an owner seeks to
convert a nonconforming sign to a digital sign, the sign must be brought into
full compliance with existing sign- code requirements.
      (3)   Nonconforming uses. The requirements established in Chapter
1153, Nonconforming Uses, shall not apply to the action of substituting a
static billboard face for an digital face as described in this subsection.
      (4)   Size, height, style, brightness of digital billboards.  
         A.   Size: The maximum total sign area for digital billboards shall
not exceed that of the billboards they replace, and in no case shall exceed 378
square feet. In cases where multiple billboards are attached to a single
support system, only one billboard may be a digital billboard.
         B.   Height: The maximum height of digital billboard shall not exceed
35 feet above the street elevation, or the maximum height requirements of the
zoning district it lies within, whichever is less.
         C.   Style: Other than changes of digital image, which shall not occur
more frequently than once every eight seconds, restrictions listed in Sections
1187.10(a) and (b) shall apply.
         D.   Brightness: To protect residential areas from excessive or
pulsating light, the brightness of light emitted from an electronic variable
message sign shall not increase by more than 0.3 foot candles (over ambient
levels) as measured using a foot candle meter at a distance of 200 feet. Within
1,000 feet of residences, the brightness may be required to be adjusted to 0.25
foot candles (over ambient levels). The foot candle readings will be taken as
follows:
            1.   At least 30 minutes past sunset, use a foot candle meter to
record the ambient light reading for the area. This is done while the digital
billboard is off or displaying all black copy.
            2.   The reading should be taken with the meter aiming directly at
the digital sign from a distance of 200 feet.
            3.   Turn the digital display to full white copy and take another
reading.
            4.   If the difference between the readings is 0.3 foot candles or
less (Or, if required, 0.25 foot candles if within 1,000 feet of a residence)
the brightness is properly adjusted.
The desired effect of these standards is to drop the night time brightness of
the sign to approximately 4% to 15% of its capable output, and is based on the
daytime brightness operating near maximum output (7500 nits), which is required
to overcome full sunlight.
In addition, toning of individual colors may be required to reduce brightness
intensity of particular colors. Upon demand, the digital billboard owner/
operator will be required to demonstrate clear and comprehensible proof that a
sign is in compliance.
      (5)   If located on a state highway. If the sign is located on a state
highway, the following information must be provided:
         A.   A copy of the current ODOT sign permit for the existing sign.
         B.   A copy of the ODOT permit allowing the proposed electronic
variable message sign. In lieu of a permit for the proposed sign, a notarized
statement is acceptable from the sign owner stating the current and proposed
billboard conforms to all state regulations and standards established by the
Ohio Revised Code and all appropriate state and federal agencies.
      (6)   Existing structure. Replacement sign size cannot exceed the size of
the original sign. If the existing sign is nonconforming in regard to size, the
replacement variable message sign must be altered to conform.
      (7)   Permit procedures.  
         A.   A permit for an electronic medium billboard will be issued upon
providing information stipulated on the permit application and completion of
the requirements listed in this subsection and payment of the appropriate fee.
         B.   Permits are valid for a period of two years from the date of
issuance of the permit. At the end of the two-year period, a new permit must be
obtained or the electronic variable message (digital) billboard must be
removed. Continuing permits will not be issued if the electronic variable
message sign demonstrates a history of noncompliance.
         C.   Permits for electronic variable message signs may be revoked
under if any of the following occur:
            1.   That the application for the permit, or supporting
information, contains materially false, misleading or inaccurate information.
            2.   An electronic variable message device has been erected or
maintained contrary to the terms and conditions of the permit.
            3.   The required fee has not been paid.
            4.   That the location does not conform to the rules and laws of
the State and City.
            5.   That any other provisions of this section or the rules adopted
hereunder have been violated.
      (8)   Emergency community notification. All digital billboard owners and

When the Zoning Inspector or his designee finds, upon the investigation, that a
sign is unsafe and/or unsound structurally, he shall notify the owner of the
said sign, together with the owner of the land on which the sign is located, by
certified mail of his findings. Such notice shall advise the owner that the
sign has been declared abandoned and/or unsafe and/or structurally unsound and
must be removed within ten (10) days for an unsafe and/or structurally unsound
sign. The owner may request an opinion as to the existence of a violation from
the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided for in Section
1127 of the Zoning Code. If an unsafe, or structurally unsound sign is not
removed as ordered and the owner has not requested an opinion as to the
existence of the violation from the Board of Zoning Appeals, the same may be

with the following provisions:
      (1)   The size and structural shape shall not be changed or altered. The
copy may be changed provided that the change applies to the original
nonconforming use associated with the sign and that the change is made by the
owner of the sign at the time the sign became nonconforming; the copy area
shall not be enlarged. Any subsequent owner or user shall bring the sign into
compliance within 30 days.
      (2)   In case damage occurs to the sign extent of 60% or more of either
the structure or the replacement value of the sign, the sign shall be brought
into compliance. Where damage in the sign is less than 60% of the structure or
its replacement value, the sign shall be repaired within 60 days.
   (e)   If any sign installed, erected, constructed or maintained in violation
of any provision of this Chapter, except for nonconforming signs in compliance
with Section
1187.12, the Zoning Inspector or his designee shall notify the owner if user
thereof to comply with the provisions of this chapter by certified mail. If the
owner or user fails to comply with such notice, and the owner has not requested
an opinion as to the existence of the violation from the Board of Zoning
Appeals, or, after a reasonable search, cannot be found, the Zoning Inspector
or his designee shall cause such graphic or such portion thereof as is
constructed or maintained in violation of this chapter to be taken down; the
expense of which shall be paid by the owner or user. Unless clearly specified
otherwise, the property owner will be considered to be the presumptive owner of
said sign. However, nothing herein contained shall prevent the Zoning Inspector
or his designee from adopting such precautionary measures as may seem to him
necessary or advisable in case imminent danger to place the graphic in safe
condition, the expense of which shall be paid by the owner of the premises or
recovered against him in the manner as further described in this section.
   If a violation of a provision of this Chapter is repeated within 180 days of
a previous violation of the same provision of this chapter by the owner or user
subject of the previous violation on the same property as the previous
violation, such sign maybe seized immediately and a charge assessed for removal
without additional notification.
   Fees for removal shall be immediately due and payable to the Municipality.
Notice of such assessment shall be given to the owner or user by mailing such
notice to the address utilized by the County Treasurer for tax billing purposes
and by posting a Notice of Assessment at the subject premises where the sign
owner and property owner are the same. All assessments not paid within ten (10)
days after such mailing and posting, after approval by Council, shall be
certified by Finance Director to the County Auditor to be placed on the tax
duplicate and collected as other taxes are collected.
   The City may also collect such costs together with interest through a civil
action in the appropriate court of law having jurisdiction thereof and seek
such additional orders from a court of competent jurisdiction as many be
necessary from time to time in order to enforce the provisions of this section.

CHAPTER 1190
Planned Unit Development District
1190.01    Purpose.
1190.02    Permitted uses.
1190.03    Minimum tract size.
1190.04    Procedures and plan requirements.
1190.05    Development standards and performance requirements.
 
 
1190.01  PURPOSE.
   The Planned Unit Development (PUD) District is offered as an option to the
requirements of the standard zoning districts in order to provide:
   (a)   A maximum choice of living or working environments by allowing a
variety of housing and building types, lot dimensions, yards, building
setbacks, and area requirements;
   (b)   A useful and suitably located pattern of open space and recreation
areas;
   (c)   Convenience in the location of commercial and industrial areas;
   (d)   Accommodation of a mixture of residential and nonresidential land uses
which is not available through the standard zoning districts and which is
designed to complement existing and proposed development;
   (e)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography
and geological features, unique natural features, trees and other vegetation,
and avoids the disruption of natural drainage patterns;
   (f)   More efficient use of land and utilities than generally achieved
through conventional development; and
   (g)   A development pattern in harmony with the land use density,
transportation, and community facilities objectives of the comprehensive plan.
      (Ord. 74-98. Passed 10-19-98.)
1190.02 PERMITTED USES.
   Land and buildings in the PUD District shall be limited to one or more of
the following uses as specified by the applicant in the required development
plan:
   (a)   Standard City residential district uses;
   (b)   Commercial and industrial use permitted in the B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4, and
M-1 Districts;
   (c)   Office/retail industrial combinations;
   (d)   Zero side lot line, two-family, townhouse, or other innovative forms
of residential development;
   (e)   Accessory buildings and uses in association with a permitted dwelling;
   (f)   Open space and recreational areas including accessory facilities
developed in accordance with the requirements of these regulations; and
   (g)   Churches or other places of worship. Normally, a yard area of not less
than three (3) acres is required. In addition, there should be one (1) acre or
more per 100 seats in the main assembly area. These guidelines may be modified
when justified by the PUD application.
   (h)   Other lawful uses are permitted which, in the opinion of Council,
based upon the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission, meet the
purpose and intent of the PUD District and are adequately designed, located,
and otherwise provided for by the development plan and other required
documents.
      (Ord. 74-98. Passed 10-19-98.)
1190.03 MINIMUM TRACT SIZE.
   A minimum tract size of forty (40) acres is normally required for submission
of a PUD application. However, applications for tracts of less than forty (40)
acres may be accepted by the City Zoning Inspector, provided one or more of the
following applies:
   (a)   The subject tract is contiguous to other land zoned PUD by the City or
is adjacent to an equivalent PUD District within an adjacent jurisdiction.
   (b)   The Planning and Zoning Commission Chairman determines that the spirit
and intent of the City Zoning Ordinance shall be best served by application of
the PUD District.
      (Ord. 74-98. Passed 10-19-98.)
   
1190.04 PROCEDURES AND PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Incentives for Use. The PUD District is intended to provide incentives
to encourage its use by permitting certain variations from normal development
standards. In addition, the process permits a combined review of zoning and
some subdivision plat requirements. In exchange for flexibility, the PUD
District requires that the zoning application provide information traditionally
found in the subdivision stage of development review. Approval of the PUD
Zoning Development Plan constitutes approval of the preliminary subdivision
plan. The PUD Zoning Development Plan is reviewed by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and Council.
   (b)   Sketch Plan. Prior to the PUD Zoning Development Plan preparation, an
applicant for a PUD District is required to informally discuss the PUD with
City staff and Commission. The developer shall submit to the Zoning Department
fourteen (14) copies of the sketch plan to be distributed among the City
Department heads and other interested parties. A sketch plan review meeting
shall be set up and the developer notified of its time and place. The sketch
plan review meeting is intended to provide a forum for discussions on general
layouts proposed, land use, density, and other policy issues. The applicant is
not limited regarding the number of sketch plan reviews or the time period
involved. This open sketch plan review process is intended to allow the
applicant and the City the time necessary to reach consensus on the fundamental
concepts of the PUD. At any time, the applicant may opt to proceed to the
formal PUD Zoning Development Plan review stage, provided a revised sketch plan
illustrating all changes to date is submitted to the City.
   (c)   PUD Zoning Development Plan Submission. Fourteen (14) copies of a
preliminary development plan, prepared by a registered engineer or surveyor and
architect or landscape architect, shall be submitted by the fee simple
landowner or lessee with the application to amend the Zoning District Map. Such
preliminary Zoning Development Plan shall conform to Section
1190.05 and shall include the following:
      (1)   A legal description of the total site proposed for development,
including information regarding present and proposed ownership. Include
existing and proposed zoning information and evidence that the applicant has
sufficient control over the land to implement the proposed PUD.
      (2)   The preliminary subdivision plan requirements of the City
Subdivision Regulations. The site plan and accompanying maps shall illustrate
watercourses, floodplains, topographical contours at two (2) foot intervals,
soils information at a one (1) inch equals 100 feet scale, information on
wooded areas, and proposed provisions of utilities including sewage disposal,
water supply, and stormwater drainage systems. Engineering concepts shall be
submitted where necessary as determined by the City Engineer.
      (3)   The location and size of all existing buildings, structures, and
proposed location and size of areas of residential use, indicating anticipated
dwelling unit densities, dwelling unit types, the total number of dwelling
units for each density area, and the total number of dwelling units proposed.
      (4)   The proposed size, location and types of uses of nonresidential
portions of the tract, including commercial areas, industrial areas, usable
open spaces, school sites, and all other areas and spaces with the suggested
ownership or lot layout of such areas and spaces.
      (5)   Drawings illustrating architectural design concepts to be utilized,
landscaping plans (as provided in Section
1190.05). Representative conceptual streetscapes and other information relating
to the architectural and landscape themes of the proposed PUD. Such drawings
should be sufficient to relay the basic architectural and landscaping intent of
the proposed improvements.
      (6)   The existing and proposed circulation system of arterial, collector
and local streets including right-of-way widths, pavement widths, street
lighting, driveway widths, off-street parking areas, service areas, loading
areas, major points of access to public rights-of-way, and public
transportation improvements. Walks and other proposed pedestrian access ways
should be illustrated. Notations of proposed ownership, public or private,
should be included where appropriate.
      (7)   A development schedule indicating the approximate date when
construction of the PUD or stages of the PUD can be expected to begin and be
completed.
      (8)   A text description of the relationship of the proposed PUD Zoning
Development Plan to the City Comprehensive Plan and other adopted plans and
policies.
      (9)   When privately-maintained common areas or open space are proposed,
deed restrictions, protective covenants and other legal statements or devices
to be used to control the use, development and maintenance of the land, shall
be provided.
      (10)   Sufficient information on land areas adjacent to the proposed PUD
to indicate the relationships between the proposed development and adjacent
areas, including land uses, zoning classification, permitted densities, public
facilities, and natural features of the landscape.
      (11)   Other information, as may be required by the Commissioner or
Council, in order to determine compliance with this chapter.
   (d)   PUD Zoning Development Plan Text. An accompanying text shall be
submitted which address the above plan requirements and describes the
commitments of the plan in sufficient detail to facilitate timely review by the
City. This text is intended to describe the general concepts to be utilized,
including the theme which integrates the various uses. For example, the
standard building package for a franchise business may not be appropriate
unless it is modified to blend with the architectural theme of other structures
in the PUD. The text should describe the general modifications necessary.
   (e)   PUD Zoning Development Plan Review. The PUD Zoning Development Plan
shall be reviewed according to policies, standards, provisions, and scheduling
requirements specified in the Codified Ordinances.
   (f)   PUD Zoning Development Plan Approval. The PUD Zoning Development Plan
shall be reviewed at a public hearing by the Commission. A formal
recommendation for approval, disapproval or some modification of the PUD Zoning
Development Plan shall be forwarded to Council by the Commission. Council shall
advertise for a public hearing on the PUD Zoning Development Plan.
   (g)   Basis of Approval. A PUD Zoning Development Plan may be approved by
Council, provided the following criteria are met:
      (1)   A development pattern is proposed which is consistent with the
purpose, intent, and applicable standards of this Zoning Code;
      (2)   The proposed development is in conformity with the comprehensive
plan or portion thereof as it may apply;
      (3)   The proposed development advances the general welfare of the City;
and
      (4)   That the benefits, improved arrangement, and the design of the
proposed development requirements included in this Zoning Code.
   (h)   Effect of Approval. The PUD Zoning Development Plan as approved by
Council shall constitute a PUD Zoning District as it applies to Council.
Approval of the PUD Zoning Development Plan constitutes approval of a
preliminary subdivision plan as required by the City Subdivision Regulations.
The approval shall be for a period of three (3) years to allow the preparation
of the required subdivision plat, submitted in accordance with the City
Subdivision Regulations. Unless the required subdivision plat is submitted and
recorded within the three year time limit, the approval shall be voided and the
land shall revert to agricultural zoning district, except if an application for
time extension is approved in accordance with the following subsection.
   (i)   Extension of Time of Modification. Extension of time limit or
modifications of the PUD Zoning Development Plan may be approved by resolution
of Council. Such approval shall be given upon a finding of the purpose or
necessity for such extension or modification and evidence of reasonable effort
toward the accomplishment of the original PUD Zoning Development Plan as
approved by Council, and that such extension or modification is not in conflict
with the general health, safety and welfare of the public or the development
standards of the PUD District. No such modification or extension shall be
approved by Council until a recommendation regarding the same is received from
the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 38-99. Passed 7-19-99.)
1190.05 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Intensity of Use. The maximum net residential density shall be twelve
(12) dwelling units per acre of area devoted to residential use. Commercial and
industrial uses shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) lot coverage by
buildings, parking, and traffic circulation areas.
   (b)   Calculation of Density. The calculation of residential density shall
include all land devoted to residential use, and shall further include
easements for utilities except major facilities which do not serve individual
dwellings. The calculation of residential density shall also include surface
drainage facilities (detention areas and retention areas, if designed for
recreational use or open space purposes in addition to stormwater management
functions), recreation space, and other areas provided as common open space
including land dedicated to public use except required street rights-of-way.
   (c)   Green Space. The minimum percentage of overall area devoted to green
space shall be twenty percent (20%). This green space shall be either dedicated
and maintained by the City of Heath or dedicated to a homeowner/property owners
association (formed by the developer) at the City's discretion. If a homeowner/
property owners association is required, then the developer shall submit the
necessary documents to the City Planning Commission for review and approval.
   (d)   Arrangement of Areas. Areas of various densities within the PUD
District, in addition to achieving these development standards, shall be so
arranged and distributed so that the development of higher density shall be
appropriately balanced by open space or low density development. When
residential zoning districts, or other permitted uses are proposed, the
development plan shall provide for building setbacks, landscaping and buffering
along the common lot line of such zoning district boundary in order to
accomplish an effective separation between the two areas. Transitions between
commercial or industrial uses and adjacent residential uses shall be
accomplished with screening, setbacks, and design elements sensitive to the
adjacent uses as described in the City's Landscape and Open Space and
Recreation Ordinances.
   (e)   Arrangement of Structures. The physical relationship of dwelling units
and their minimum yard space shall be determined in accordance with the
approved development plan. The burden shall be on the applicant to demonstrate
that the proposed arrangement of structures will create a pleasing, functional,
and safe environment.
   (f)   Traffic.
      (1)   The PUD Zoning Development Plan shall be accompanied by a
preliminary analysis of traffic conditions which can be expected to result from
the proposed development. Using existing data and formulas from the resources
listed below, the analysis shall estimate the Average Daily Traffic (ADT), the
peak hours of traffic, and distribution of the same to the existing and
proposed street system, together with a brief analysis of improvements which
may be necessary to accommodate the additional traffic. The applicant shall
state and document assumptions made regarding the projected traffic figures.
The following standard techniques and references, or other references which may
be acceptable to the City:
         A.   Highway Capacity Manual (Special Report #87, 1965, National
Academy of Sciences).
         B.   Transportation Research Circular #212.
         C.   "Trip Generation": Institute of Traffic Engineers (Current
Edition). Traffic analysis shall be based on existing off-site conditions and

that all performance requirements of the City Zoning Code are maintained,
including:
      (1)   Smoke. No smoke from an industrial or commercial process shall be
emitted from any structure in the PUD.
      (2)   Odor. No use shall emit odorous gases or other odorous matter in
such quantities as to be detectable at any point on or beyond the PUD boundary.
      (3)   Noise. No commercial, service, or industrial use shall emit greater
than fifty-five decibels at the lot line.
   (n)   Graphics. The PUD Zoning Development Plan shall establish details
illustrating the criterion proposed for a unified graphics theme for the
proposed PUD. At a minimum, all graphics shall conform to Chapter
1187 of the Building Code. All graphics permits within a PUD District shall be
approved by the City Graphics Commission. For purposes of the PUD Zoning
Development Plan, the applicant shall describe the types, limitations, and
controls to be utilized along with descriptions, examples, or sufficient
detained information on the proposed graphics to be utilized within the PUD
District. In no case shall PUD graphic requirements be less restrictive than

11105.02   Computing rear and side yards.
11105.03   Side yard modifications.
 
 
11105.01 AVERAGE DEPTH OF FRONT YARDS.
   In any R District, where the average depth of at least two existing front
yards on lots within 100 feet of the lot in question and within the same block
front is less or greater than the least front yard prescribed elsewhere in this
Zoning Ordinance, the required depth of the front yard on such lot shall be
modified. In such cases, this shall not be less than the average depth of such
existing front yards on the two lots immediately adjoining, or, in the case of
a corner lot, the depth of the front yard on the lot immediately adjoining;
provided, however, that the depth of a front yard on any lot shall be at least
ten feet and need not exceed fifty feet; and provided further, that in no event
shall the depth of a front yard of a corner lot be less than twenty-five feet.
   (a)   Steep Slopes; Front Yard Garage. In any R District where the natural
grade of a lot within the required front yard has an average slope, normal to
the front lot line at every point along such line, of such a degree of percent
of slope that it is not practicable to provide a driveway with a grade of
twelve percent (12%) or less to a private garage conforming to the requirements
of this Zoning Ordinance, such garage may be located within such front yard,
but not in any case closer than twelve feet to the street line.
   (b)   Double Frontage Lots. Buildings on lots having frontage on two
nonintersecting streets need not have a rear yard if an equivalent open space
is provided on the lot in lieu of such required rear yard; applicable front
yards must be provided, however, on both streets.
      (Ord. 21-67. Passed 12-4-67.)
11105.02 COMPUTING REAR AND SIDE YARDS.
   In computing the depth of a rear yard or the width of a side yard where the
rear or side yard abuts an alley, one-half of the width of the alley may be
included as a portion of the required rear or side yard, as the case may be.
However, in no event shall any building or structure be erected closer than
five feet from any lot line.
(Ord. 21-67. Passed 12-4-67.)
11105.03 SIDE YARD MODIFICATIONS.
   (a)   Side Yard Increased. Each side yard, where required, shall be
increased in width by two inches for each foot by which the length of the side
wall of the building, adjacent to the side yard, exceeds forty feet.
   (b)   Side Yard; Corner Lot. A side yard along the side street lot line of a
corner lot, which lot abuts in the rear, either directly or across an alley,
the side lot line of another lot in an R District, shall have a width of not
less than one-half the required depth of the front yard on such other lot
fronting the side street.
   (c)   Frontage Modifications. In the case of curvilinear streets and cul-de-
sacs the Board may authorize a reduction of the otherwise specified lot
frontage in an R District, provided that:
      (1)   The lot width measured at the building line shall equal the
frontage required in the district where located;
      (2)   The front lot line shall be not less than forty feet in any event;
and
      (3)   Such reduction of frontage shall not result in a reduction of the
required lot area.
         (Ord. 21-67. Passed 12-4-67.)

entrance floor of the building except for a railing not exceeding three feet in
height.
   (e)   Bay windows, balconies, uncovered porches and chimneys may project a
distance not exceeding three feet, provided that such features do not occupy,
in the aggregate, more than one-third of the length of the building wall on
which they are located.
   (f)   Subject to the limitations in Section
11107.02, the above-named features may project into any required side yard
adjoining an interior side lot line, a distance not to exceed one-fifth of the
required least width of such side yard, but not exceeding three feet in any
case.
   (g)   Subject to the limitations in subsection (f) hereof, the features
named herein may project into any required rear yards the same distances they
are permitted to project into a front yard.
      (Ord. 21-67. Passed 12-4-67.)
11107.02 FENCES, WALLS AND HEDGES.
   Fences walls and hedges may be located in required yards as follows:
   (a)   If not exceeding at any point four feet in height above the elevation
of the surface of the ground at such point, they may be located in any yard.

11111.01  OPEN SPACE AND RECREATION.
   It is found that in order to protect public health, safety, and welfare, an
adequate amount of land should be dedicated and developed for open space, park,
and recreational purposes. Therefore, all development within the planning
jurisdiction shall pay a fee-in-lieu of land dedication, unless the City of
Heath, or some other governmental agency requests the dedication or provision
of a portion of such land, the provision of a combination of land dedication
and fee payment, or the provision of a perpetual conservation easement, as set
forth in this resolution, for the purpose of providing park and recreation
facilities to serve future residents of the City.
   Developed open space shall be designed to provide active recreational
facilities to serve the residents of the City. Undeveloped open space shall be
designed to preserve important site amenities, scenic vistas, and
environmentally sensitive areas.
(Ord. 66-98. Passed 10-19-98.)
11111.02 CHOICE OF OPEN SPACE AND RECREATIONAL LAND OR FEE-IN- LIEU.
   (a)    Filing. At the time of filing the Preliminary Plan for approval, the
subdivider shall indicate whether a fee, land, or a combination of the two will
be provided to meet the requirements of these regulations.
   (b)    Determination. The Heath City Planning Commission (HCPC) shall
determine with the advice of the City of Heath Parks Department (CHPD) whether
the plans of the subdivider to pay a fee-in-lieu of land, dedicate or provide
land, or provide a combination of land dedication and fee payment are
acceptable. This decision will be made as part of the review of the preliminary
plan.
(Ord. 66-98. Passed 10-19-98.)
11111.03  MINIMUM OPEN SPACE AND RECREATIONAL LAND REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Fee-in-lieu of Land Provision.
      (1)    Amount of fee-in-lieu. In the event that open space and
recreational land designation is inappropriate or infeasible, the HCPC shall
request the subdivider to pay a park fee in lieu of land provision. The per
unit fee will be collected at the time final plat approval is requested and
shall be based on the total number of units contained within the final plat as
determined by using the following formula:
 
Fee-in-Lieu of    =    Land area that would     X Fair market value
land dedication       otherwise be required
            to be provided as determined
            by subsection (b)(1) hereof.
      (2)    Determination of fair market value. For the purposes of this
resolution, fair market value shall be determined as follows:
         A.   Time for Determination. Fair market value shall equal the average
value per acre of all land in each subdivision or development in its raw,
undeveloped state, at the time of Final Plat filing, determined by application
of one of the following procedures:
            1.   By agreement between the subdivider and the HCPC.
            2.   In the event the subdivider and the HCPC cannot agree, by
determination of the HCPC on the basis of assessed value for property tax
purposes of all land in the subdivision, modified to equal market value in
accordance with current assessment practices, and divided by the total number
of acres within the subdivision; or
            3.   In the event the subdivider objects to the valuation method
set forth in subsection (2), then by a qualified independent appraiser approved
by the HCPC. The fee for the appraiser will be paid by the subdivider.
   (b)    Land Provision and Dedication.
      (1)    Minimum amount of land. The minimum amount of land to be dedicated
or provided by a subdivider as open or recreational space shall be determined
in accordance with the following formula (gross site area and number of
dwelling units is as shown on the preliminary plan):
 
Acres of land    =    (0.02 X gross site area)    +    0.03 per dwelling
to be decanted                   unit proposed
or provided
         These minimums shall not be construed to prohibit the voluntary
dedication or provision of lands by the subdivider in excess of the
requirements established by these regulations.
       (2)    Characteristics of land. The HCPC will use the following criteria
to judge whether land to be dedicated or provided is satisfactory for open
space and recreational purposes. These criteria may be adjusted if the HCPC
determines that doing so will be in the best public interest.
         A.   Unity. Land to be dedicated or provided must form a single parcel
of land or else consist of a few large pieces connected by a trail, path, or
walkway. Every attempt should be made to match open spaces and/or recreational
land with similar land on adjoining lots or subdivisions.
         B.   Composition. Utility, drainage, or other easements that are
typically required as part of the subdivision process shall not count toward
the provision of open space. This includes all road right-of-way, all roadside
ditches, and any retention or detention ponds unless designed as part of an
overall common open space and approved by the HCPC.
         C.   Size, Shape, and Topography. The land shall be of such minimum
dimensions and maximum slope as to be functionally usable for recreational
purposes. Steep slopes, streams, lakes, jurisdictional wetlands, water courses,
and flood plains may constitute a maximum of forty percent (40%) of such land.
         D.   Location. The land to be dedicated or provided shall be
convenient to the dwelling units it is intended to serve. Due to the potential
for noise generation, however, the land shall also be sited with sensitivity to
surrounding development.
         E.   Access. Public access and maintenance to the land shall be
provided from adjoining street frontage.
          F.   Preservation of Natural Beauty. Scenic natural features such as
trees, plant life, watercourses, topography, and views, and any historic or
archeologic locations shall be considered and preserved in the provision of
open space, parks, and recreation areas.
      (3)    Open space ownership. The type of ownership of land dedicated or
provided for open space purposes shall be selected by the owner, subdivider, or
developer, subject to the approval of the HCPC and the CHPD. The type of
ownership may include, but is not limited to the following:
         A.   The local government, subject to acceptance by the governing
board of the local government.
         B.   Other public jurisdictions or agencies, subject to their
acceptance.
         C.   Quasi-public organizations, subject to their acceptance.
         D.   Homeowner, condominium, or cooperative associations or
organizations; or
         E.   Shares, undivided interest by all property owners in the
subdivision.
         Ownership shall be determined based on the type of open space to be
provided. For example, perpetual conservation easements and significant passive
open space such as linear parks shall be owned and maintained by the CHPD.
Active recreation areas such as tot lots or ball fields shall be owned and
maintained by a homeowners association or other responsible local entity.
       (4)    Homeowners Association. If the open space is owned and maintained
by a homeowner or condominium association, the developer shall file with the
application for preliminary approval a declaration of covenants and
restrictions that will govern the association. The provisions shall include,
but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   The homeowners association must be established before the lots
are sold.
         B.   Membership must be mandatory for each home buyer and any
successive home buyer.
         C.   The open space restrictions must be permanent, not just for a
period of years.
         D.   The association must be responsible for liability insurance,
local taxes, and the maintenance of recreational and other facilities.
         E.   Homeowners must pay their pro rata share of the cost, and the
assessment levied by the association can become a lien on the property if
allowed in the master deed establishing the homeowner's association; and
         F.   The association must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changed needs.
      (5)    Treatment of land. Following approval of a preliminary plat which
designates land for open space and recreation, the existing vegetation (except
growing commercial crops other than growing timber), topography, features of
historic value, stream courses, soil, rock, strata, and other natural features
of such dedicated or provided land shall not be altered or have their condition
adversely affected in any way without the consent of HCPC.
      (6)    Improvement of land. There are two general types of land that meet
the open space requirements of these regulations:
Developed Open Space: the HCPC may require the installation of recreational
facilities, taking into consideration:
         A.   The character of the open space land;
         B.   The estimated age and the recreation needs of persons likely to
reside in the development.
         C.   Proximity, nature, and excess capacity of existing recreation
facilities; and
         D.   The cost of recreational facilities.
Undeveloped Open Space: As a general principle, undeveloped open space should
be left in its natural state. The subdivider may make certain improvements such
as the cutting of trails for walking or jogging, or the provision of picnic
areas, etc. In addition, the HCPC may require a subdivider to make other
improvements such as removing dead or diseased trees or grading or seeding.
The developer shall provide developed open space with recreation facilities
when the developments equal or exceed 4 units per acre, or as required by the
HCPC.
      (7)    Deed restrictions. Any lands designed for open space purposes
shall contain appropriate covenants and deed restrictions approved by the City
Law Director ensuring that:
         A.   The open space will not be further subdivided in the future;
         B.   The use of open space will continue in perpetuity for the purpose
specified;
         C.   Appropriate provisions will be made for the maintenance of open
space by the homeowners association. If in the opinion of the HCPC the open
space is not properly maintained, then the City shall perform the necessary
maintenance and the cost for same shall be charged to the homeowners
association.
         D.   Common, undeveloped open space shall not be turned into a
commercial enterprise admitting the general public at a fee or as part of a
membership.
       (8)    Procedure for designation open space land. Dedication or
provision of land shall be by general warranty deed conveying to the owner,
whether it be the City of Heath, a homeowners association, or other approved
owner, good and marketable title to the real estate described in such deed,
free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. This deed shall be submitted to
the County Recorder and shall be recorded simultaneously with the final plat
map.
       (9)    Perpetual conservation easements. At the discretion of the City,
with the advice of the HCPC, perpetual conservation easements may be used in
lieu of fee simple acquisition where appropriate to preserve natural features.
Under this alternative, more land may be necessary to accomplish this goal than
would be required by simply using the formula for land dedication provided in
subsection (b)(1) hereof.
       (10)    Open space designations for phased subdivisions. The City
recognizes that for phased subdivisions, the land most suitable for open space
and recreation may not be accessible in the initial stages of the development.
If the open space to be designed will not be immediately accessible, the
subdivider shall pay a fee-in-lieu of land dedication to the City as each phase
of development is platted. This fee, calculated as described below, shall be
based on the acreage and number of lots for the phase of the development to be
platted. The fee will be placed in an escrow account and will be returned to
the developer once the land to be provided or dedicated is fully accessible and
acceptable.
If the open space will be accessible during the first phase of the development,
the subdivider has the option of dedicating or providing the open space for the
entire subdivision, or providing only that portion of the land required for
that phase to be platted.
         (Ord. 66-98. Passed 10-19-98.)
11111.04 LIMITATION ON USE OF REQUIRED LAND AND FEES.
   Any land and fees received by the City pursuant to this resolution shall be
used only for the purpose of providing park and recreational facilities to
serve the citizens. Fees paid pursuant to this resolution shall be deposited in
a Parks and Recreational Capital Improvement Fund to be used for the
acquisition, development, and improvement of park and recreational facilities.
No part of such fees shall be used for the purpose of paying salaries, wages,

promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (b)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (c)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Heath as identified in Section
11112.01(d) below, including any additional areas of special flood hazard
annexed by Heath.
   (d)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Licking County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Licking County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective 03/16/2015.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Heath as required by Section
11112.04(c) - Subdivisions and Other New Developments.
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the Municipal Building, 1287 Hebron Rd, Heath, OH 43056.
   (e)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or
deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another ordinance,
easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes
the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (f)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (g)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Heath, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (h)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof,
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 59-
2024. Passed 8-19-24.)
   11112.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined in this Chapter, words or phrases used in herein
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   "Accessory Structure" means a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   "Appeal" means a request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   "Base Flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or one hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   "Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)" means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the lowest adjacent natural grade elevation plus
the depth number (from one (1) to three (3) feet).
   (e)   "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.

   (h)   "Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management)" means issued by
President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted
activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special
flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   "Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)" means the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   "Fill" means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   "Flood" or "Flooding" means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   "Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)" means usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)   "Flood Insurance Rate Map ('FIRM')" means an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   "Flood Insurance Risk Zones" means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in any
given year; base flood elevations are not determined.
      Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-
year flood in any given year; base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in
any given year; with flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet (usually sheet
flow on sloping terrain); average depths are determined.
      Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood in
any given year; flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet (usually areas of
ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to
be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing
drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
      Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (o)   "Flood Insurance Study (FIS)" means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
   (q)   "Flood Protection Elevation" means the Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard. In areas where
no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (r)   "Floodway" means a floodway is the channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to
pass the base flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a
hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase
in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a
designated height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot
at any point within the community.
      The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized
by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (s)   "Freeboard means" a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)   "Historic structure" means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (u)   "Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis" means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (v)   "Letter of Map Change (LOMC)" means a Letter of Map Change is an
official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance
Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood
Insurance Studies.
   (w)   "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (x)   "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (y)   "Manufactured home park" means as specified in the Ohio Adm. Code
4781-12-01(K), a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority. Manufactured home
park does not include any tract of land used solely for the storage or display
for sale of manufactured homes.
   (z)   "Mean sea level" means for purposes of the National Flood Insurance
Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to
which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are
referenced.
   (aa)   "National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)" means the NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (bb)   "New construction" means the structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after effective date of a floodplain regulation
adopted by the City of Heath and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
      For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction'' commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
floodplain regulation and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (cc)   "Person" includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15(A)(2) as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (dd)   "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (ee)   "Registered Professional Architect" means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio Revised
Code Sections 4703.01 to 4703.19.
   (ff)   "Registered Professional Engineer" means a person registered as a
professional engineer pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 4733.
   (gg)   "Registered Professional Surveyor" means a person registered as a
professional surveyor pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Chapter 4733.
   (hh)   "Special Flood Hazard Area" also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard" means the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 30, or A99. Special flood hazard areas may also
refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal state or
local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone
soils associated with a watercourse.
   (ii)   "Start of construction" means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (jj)   "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (kk)   "Substantial Damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to the 'before damaged'
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (ll)   "Substantial Improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to by the local code enforcement official and
which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (mm)   "Variance" means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations.
   (nn)   "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 59-2024. Passed 8-19-24.)

         A.   Each federal agency has a responsibility to evaluate the
potential effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain; to ensure that
its planning programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards
and floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the
policies and requirements of EO 11988.
   (k)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Heath's flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
11112.01(d) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six (6) months of the date
such information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            (i)   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            (ii)   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special

Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            (i)   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            (ii)   Proposed development which increases the base flood
elevation by more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base
flood elevations but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
11112.03(j).
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Heath, and
may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Heath have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Heath Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Heath's
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Heath suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Heath has assumed or relinquished floodplain
management regulatory authority.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
11112.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (4)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (m)   Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data.
      (1)   Zone A:
         A.   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         B.   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)   Zones AE, A1-30, AH, and AO:
         A.   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
            (i)   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
            (ii)   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
         B.   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
11112.04(i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
      (3)   Zones B, C, and X:
         A.   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are
not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM
which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, or AO. Communities are
encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure that
the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
   (n)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            (i)   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
11112.03(k)(1).
            (ii)   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            (iii)   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one (1) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one-foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            (i)   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            (ii)   Section
11112.04(i)(1)B., items (i) and (iii)-(v).
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Heath specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
11112.03(k)(1)A.(iii) when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the

of general circulation in the community at least fifteen (15) days before the
date of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (4)   Granting of Variances. Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
