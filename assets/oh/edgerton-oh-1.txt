EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR’S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of Edgerton was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Edgerton Codified Ordinances is indicated.

month as the day of the month from which the computation is begun, unless there
are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   A.   The time within which an act is required by law to be done
shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last day; except
that when the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be
done on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
         B.   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may
be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal

   (f)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which
shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when the
subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United

   (i)   Rule 9 – Motions; When Debatable; Withdrawal. When a motion is made

   (o)   Rule 15 – Reference to Committee on Rules and Ordinances. All
ordinances of a general or permanent nature, except the ordinances for
appropriation, before their final passage, may be referred to the committee on
rules and ordinances. It shall be the duty of said committee as to any
ordinance so referred to it, to carefully compare the same with all existing
ordinances, upon the subject matter, and it shall report thereon any
discrepancy or conflict which may exist therewith. It shall also examine and
report upon the form of such discrepancy or conflict or to correct error in
form. If any amendment shall be made to any ordinance, they shall recommend the
change necessary to remedy such discrepancy or conflict or to correct error in
form. If any amendment shall be made to any ordinance after the committee has
reported thereon, it shall be recommitted to said committee for further report
thereon.
   (p)   Rule 16 – Reference to Committees. Any report, resolution, ordinance
or matter before the Council for consideration (except appropriation
ordinances), before their final passage may be referred either to the standing
committee to which the subject matter is most closely related or to a committee
specially appointed by the president of the Council. Any such committee shall
consider the matter thus referred to it and report thereon to the Council
without unnecessary delay.
   Any matter referred to a committee may by a two-thirds vote of Council at
any time prior to report of such committee, be taken from the hands of such
committee for consideration.
   (q)   Rule 17 – Limitation on Debate or Discussion.  No member of the
Council while Council is in session shall engage in debate or discussion with
anyone save another member of the Council or the president of the Council or
some person who has either been granted by the Council the privilege to address
the Council or is present at a Council meeting on invitation of the Council.
All such debate or discussion shall be governed by Robert’s Rules of Order.
   (r)   Rule 18 – Public Participation at Council Meetings. The legislative
process is the function of Council and the Mayor. Members of the public have no
absolute right to speak at a Council meeting. Whether an issue is open to
public comment during a meeting is subject to the sole discretion of the Mayor.
   To the extent the Mayor permits an issue to be open to discussion, in no
event shall a member of the public speak unless recognized and authorized to do
so by the Mayor. Unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Mayor, any person
who speaks before Council shall be limited to a three (3) minute presentation.
Upon conclusion of any presentation, the speaker shall not speak further unless
subsequently re-authorized and recognized by the Mayor.
   In determining whether to permit public discussion on a particular issue,
the Mayor may consider all reasonable and lawful factors, including, without
limitation:
   •   The nature of the issue or topic;
   •   Whether the speaker requested to be placed on the agenda in a timely
manner in accordance with Rule 6;
•   Whether the issue has been subject to prior discussion or debate;
   •   Whether the issue has been already decided by Council;
   •   Whether the issue would be better presented outside of Council directly
to the Administrator, Mayor or other Village representative; and
   •   Whether the issue is the subject of litigation or other considerations
that render public discussion inappropriate.
   Any member of the public who speaks without being recognized by the Mayor,
or otherwise engages in uncivil or unruly behavior may be prohibited from
speaking or removed from a Council meeting.
   (s)   Rule 19 – Resignation. The resignation of a member of the Council
shall not take effect until the same has been accepted by a vote of the
majority of the members exclusive of the person tendering the resignation.
   (t)   Rule 20 – Robert’s Rules of Order. In the absence of any rule upon the
matter of business, the Council shall generally be governed by “Robert’s Rules
of Order”; provided, however, that any deviation from Robert’s Rules of Order
is permitted and shall not void any proceedings.
   (u)   Rule 21 – Amendments.  These rules may be amended or altered or new
rules adopted by a vote of the majority of all the members elected at any
meeting of the Council, on the report of a committee to which the subject has
been referred at a previous meeting.
   (v)   Rule 22 – Suspension of Rules.  These rules or any of them may be
temporarily suspended at any meeting of the Council, by an affirmative vote of
the majority of members present, except when a greater number is required by
law or by these rules. The vote on such suspension shall be taken by the yeas
and nays and entered on the journal. In case any rule herein shall not have
been adhered to by the Council, the same shall be regarded as having been
suspended. (Ord. 851. Passed 9-15-08.)
121.03 GUIDELINES FOR COUNCIL MEMBERS.
   (a)   At Council Meetings.
      (1)   Members should maintain a sense of decorum and courtesy in
discussions between Council members and in exchanges with the attending public.
      (2)   If a member has received a complaint or otherwise become aware of a
problem involving Village employees or the Village, it is appropriate for that
Council member to first raise the matter with the Village Administrator prior
to the meeting in order that the matter might be resolved without the necessity
of it coming before Council, or that at least the Village Administrator will
have had an opportunity to inquire into the matter and be better able to
respond to relevant questions concerning the matter.
      (3)   Executive sessions are requested when the subject matter under
discussion is not appropriate for public discussions. Examples of such matters
are discussions of litigation, the purchase of real estate, the appointment,
promotion or demotion of personnel, and employee negotiations. Executive
sessions are not public. However, Council may invite whomever they choose to
attend the executive session. All formal action must, however, be in open
session. Minutes are not kept at executive sessions. The content of executive
sessions are confidential and should not be discussed outside of executive
session.
      (4)   If a Council member desires to go into executive session, he should
notify the Village Administrator in advance if possible. It is appropriate to
state a general reason for the executive session when the motion is made.
   (b)   Outside of Council Meetings.
      (1)   The Village furnishes seven (7) services to Village residents
through its seven (7) departments and twenty-one (21) employees. Good
management requires that there be an established chain of command and that the
chain of command be followed. Council members should respect that chain of
command.
      (2)   By state law of the Ohio Revised Code, an individual member, acting
alone, has no more authority over Village employees than any other citizen. The
Village Council, acting together, has all of the authority. If an individual
member wishes to spend time with a Village work crew or attend any meeting of
employees and supervisors, prior arrangements should be made through the
Village Administrator. It should be noted that on such occasion, the Council
member is present as an observer and not a participant.
      (3)   All issues or topics of executive session or committee meetings
will not be discussed outside of sessions. This is in violation of Ohio R.C.
4.06 and would be grounds for removal.
         (Ord. 795. Passed 10-18-04.)
121.04 COPIES OF PUBLIC DOCUMENTS.
   (a)   Copies of public documents may be requested from the appropriate
Village Department. Unless the Department determines otherwise, the charge
shall be ten cents ($.10) per page plus the cost of mailing, if mailing is
required.
   (b)   In the discretion of the Department Head, Clerk/Treasurer, or Village
Administrator, a deposit may be required to cover the anticipated costs.
   (c)   The Village will furnish copies of public records in existence at the
time the request is made. The Village will not undertake to furnish documents
not yet in existence.
(Ord. 795. Passed 10-18-04.)
121.05 CLERK AS THE DEFAULT DESIGNEE OF ELECTED OFFICIALS.
   (a)   The Clerk of the Village of Edgerton is hereby selected as the default
statutory designee as contemplated by Ohio R.C. 149.43 to attend any necessary
training on behalf of all applicable elected officials.
   (b)   The Village Clerk shall be deemed such statutory designee for all
present elected officials and all future elected officials unless an elected
official chooses another designee.
   (c)   Any elected official that chooses to have someone other than the
Village Clerk act as a statutory designee pursuant to Ohio R.C. 149.43(E) shall
notify the Village Clerk in writing, in which case the Village Clerk shall not
act as the elected official’s designee until such time as the elected official
subsequently requests, in writing, that the Village Clerk act as the elected
official’s designee. (Ord. 841. Passed 10-1-07.)

183.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of these regulations the following terms shall have the
definitions hereafter given:
   (a)   The definitions of the terms “taxpayer”, “association”, “business”,
“corporation”, “employee”, “employer”, “net profits”, “non-resident”, “person”,
“resident”, “other entity” shall be the same as set forth in Section
181.01.
   (b)   The term “Place of Business” means any bona fide office (other than a
mere statutory office) factory, warehouse, or other space which is occupied and
used by the taxpayer in carrying on any business activity individually or
through one or more of his regular employees regularly in attendance.
A taxpayer does not have a regular place of business outside Edgerton solely by
consigning goods to an independent factor or contractor outside the Village for
sale.
   (c)   The term “Business Allocation Percentage,” as used in these
regulations, means the average percentage arrived at by applying the formula
set forth in Section
181.02(h). The “Business Allocation Percentage” is the percentage which may be
applied to determine the portion of the entire net profits of a taxpayer to be
allocated as having been made within the Village of Edgerton within the meaning
of the provisions of said Section
181.02.
   (d)   The term “The Ordinance” means Ordinance No. 259 enacted by the
Council of the Village of Edgerton on December 27, 1971, (Chapter
181) and any amendments or supplements thereto.
The singular shall include the plural and the masculine shall include the
feminine and the neuter. (Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.02 COMMENCEMENT AND DURATION OF THE TAX.
   The tax imposed by the Ordinance is effective as to income and profits
earned or accruing on and after January 1, 1972, and payroll deductions must be
made against all salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses and other compensation
earned or accruing on and after that date.
   The Ordinance continues effective insofar as the levy of taxes is concerned
until December 31, 1975.
(Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.03 IMPOSITION OF TAX - RESIDENT EMPLOYEES.
   In the case of the residents of the Village of Edgerton an annual tax of one
percent (1%) is imposed on all salaries, wages, commissions other compensation
earned or accrued on and after January 1, 1972. For the purpose of determining
the tax on the earnings of the resident taxpayers, taxed under Section
181.02(a), the source of the earnings and the place or places in or at which
the services were rendered are immaterial. All such earnings, wherever earned
or paid, are taxable.
   The following are items which are subject to the tax:
   (a)   Salaries, wages, bonuses or incentive payments received by an
individual, whether directly or through an agent and whether in cash or in
property, for services rendered on and after January 1, 1972.
      (1)   As an officer, director or employee of a corporation (including
charitable and other non-profit corporations), joint stock association or joint
stock company;
      (2)   As an employee (as distinguished from a partner or member) of a
partnership, limited partnership, or any other form of unincorporated
enterprise owned by one or more persons;
      (3)   As an employee (as distinguished from the proprietor) of a
business, trade or profession conducted by an individual owner;
      (4)   As an officer or employee (whether elected, appointed or
commissioned) of a governmental administration, agency, arm, authority, board,
body, branch, bureau, department, division, subdivision, section or unit of the
State of Ohio or any of the political subdivisions thereof;
      (5)   As an officer or employee (whether elected, appointed or
commissioned) of a governmental administration, agency, arm, authority, board,
body, branch, bureau, department, division, subdivision, section or unit of the
United States Government or of a corporation created and owned, or controlled
by the United States Government or any of its agencies;
      (6)   As an employee of any other entity or person.
   (b)   Wages, bonuses, or incentive payments received by an individual,
whether directly or through an agent and whether in cash or in property, for
services rendered on and after January 1, 1972.
      (1)    Whether based upon hourly, daily, weekly, semi-monthly, monthly,
annual, unit of production or piece-work rates; and
      (2)    Whether paid by an individual, limited partnership, partnership,
association, corporation (including charitable and other non-profit
corporations), governmental administration, agency, arm, authority, board,
body, branch, department, division, subdivision, section or unit, or any other
entity.
   (c)   Commissions received by a taxpayer whether directly or through an
agent and whether in cash or in property, for services rendered on and after
January 1, 1972, regardless of how computed, by whom or wheresoever paid.
If amounts received as a drawing account exceed the commissions earned, the tax
is payable on the gross amounts received.
Amounts received from an employer by way of expenses and not by way of
compensation, and used as such by the individual receiving them, are not deemed
to be compensation if the employer deducts such expense advances as such from
his gross income for the purpose of determining his net profits taxable under
the Ordinance.
If such commissions are included in the net earnings of a trade, business,
profession, enterprise or activity regularly carried on by such individual and
therefore subject to tax under Section
181.02(c), they shall not again be separately taxed. In such case, such net
earnings shall be taxed as provided in Section
183.11.
   (d)   The receipt of fees and other compensation for personal services
rendered shall be deemed to be subject to taxation under the Ordinance.
   (e)   Domestic servants are subject to Edgerton tax under the Ordinance but
are not subject to withholding provisions. That is to say, the domestic will
report earnings and pay the tax directly to the Edgerton Income Tax Department.
      (Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.04  IMPOSITION OF TAX - NON-RESIDENTS.
   (a)   In the case of individuals who are non-residents of Edgerton, there is
imposed under the Ordinance an annual tax of one percent (1%) on all salaries,
wages, commissions and other compensation, earned or accruing on and after
January 1, 1972, for work done or services performed or rendered within the
Village of Edgerton, whether such compensation or remuneration is received or
earned directly or through an agent and whether paid in cash or in property.
   (b)   The items subject to tax under the section are the same as those
listed and defined in Section
183.03. For methods of computing the extent of such work or services performed
within the Village of Edgerton, and cases involving compensation for personal
services partly within and partially outside the Village of Edgerton, see
Section
183.14.
(Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.05  IMPOSITION OF TAX, NET BUSINESS PROFITS - RESIDENTS.
   (a)   In the case of trades, businesses, professions, other activities,
enterprises or undertakings conducted, operated, engaged in, prosecuted or
carried on by residents of Edgerton, there is imposed an annual tax of one
percent (1%) on the net profits earned or accruing on and after January 1,
1972.
   (b)   For the purpose of construing subsection (c) and (d) of Section
181.02, the term “residents” in the phrase “conducted by residents of the
Village of Edgerton” will ordinarily be construed to have reference to the
business entity itself, as distinguished from the partners, properties or other
participants in its profits.
   (c)   Generally, a partnership, association or other unincorporated
enterprise owned by two or more persons will be taxed as an entity. However, in
the case of a non-resident partnership, association or unincorporated
enterprise which cannot be reached or taxed directly by the Village of
Edgerton, or if only part of its earnings may be directly taxed, then in either
such case, resident partners, co-owners, proprietors or other participants in
the profits thereof must include in their declaration and tax return or returns
their distributive shares of such profits, or portion thereof not taxed to the
business enterprise as an entity, and must pay the tax thereon.
   (d)   The tax imposed under Section
181.02(c) is levied upon the entire net profits of the resident trade,
business, profession, other activity, enterprise, or undertaking, wherever
earned, paid or accrued and regardless of the fact that any part of such
business or professional activity may have been conducted at or through a place
or places of business located outside the Village of Edgerton.
(Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.06 IMPOSITION OF TAX, NET BUSINESS PROFITS - NON-RESIDENTS.
   (a)   In the case of a non-resident individual, partnership, association,
fiduciary or other entity (other than a corporation) engaged in the conduct,
operation or prosecution of any trade, business, profession, enterprise,
undertaking or other activity, there is imposed an annual tax of one percent
(1%) on the net profits (earned or accruing on and after January 1, 1972) of
such trade, business, profession, enterprise, undertaking, or other activity
if, and to the extent, conducted in or derived from activity in Edgerton.
   (b)   A non-resident entity within the meaning of Section
181.02(e) which has a branch or branches, office or offices and/or store or
stores, warehouses, or other place or places in which the entity’s business is
transacted, located in the Village of Edgerton, shall be considered to be
conducting, operating, prosecuting, or carrying on a trade, business,
profession, enterprise, undertaking or other activity to the full extent of the
sum total of all transactions originating or consummated in, by or through such
Edgerton branch, office, store, warehouse or other place of business,
including:
      (1)   Billings made on such transactions, or
      (2)   Services rendered, or
      (3)   Shipments made, or
      (4)   Goods, chattels, merchandise, etc., sold, or
      (5)   Commissions, fees or other remuneration or payments earned.
   (c)   In the case of the partnership, association, or other unincorporated
business owned by one or more persons the tax, generally, shall be upon said
partnership, association, or business enterprise as an entity and not
ordinarily upon the partners or members thereof. However, the provisions of
Section
183.05 are applicable to render taxable against such resident partners or
members their distributive share of any profits of such non-resident entity not
taxable under the Ordinance.
   (d)   In determining the proportion or amount of the taxable net profits of
a non-resident business entity having a place or places of business within and
outside Edgerton, such business entity may at its option use and apply the
Business Allocation Percentage Formula set forth in Section
181.02(h). For explanation of Formula, see Section
183.08.
(Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.07  IMPOSITION OF TAX, NET BUSINESS PROFITS - CORPORATIONS.
   (a)   In the case of a corporation doing business in Edgerton, whether
domestic or foreign, and, whether domiciled in Edgerton, or elsewhere, there is
imposed an annual tax of one- percent 11%) on that part of the net profits
(earned or accruing on and after January 1, 1972) of such corporations which is
earned by such corporations as a result of work done or , services performed or
rendered and business or other activities conducted in the Village of Edgerton.
   (b)   The provisions of Section
183.06(b) are applicable to such corporations.
   (c)   A corporation doing business both within and outside the Village of
Edgerton may, in determining the part of the net, profits which are taxable
under the Ordinance, at its option:
      (1)   Use the usual accounting system of the taxpayer corporation, so
long as said usual accounting system shall be one acceptable to the Federal
Internal Revenue Department as evidenced by acceptance and approval of income
tax returns filed therein; or   
      (2)   Use the Business Allocation Percentage Formula set forth in Section
181.02(h).
         (Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.08 BUSINESS ALLOCATION PERCENTAGE.
   (a)   At the option of a corporate taxpayer or of a non-resident business
entity, such taxpayers may, but are not obliged to, use the formula set forth
in Section
181.02 to compute the percentage of their entire net profits (derived from
activities both within and outside the Village of Edgerton) which is taxable
under the Ordinance, and to determine the tax payable to the Village of
Edgerton thereunder.
      (1)   If the taxpayer did not have a place of business outside Edgerton
during the period covered by any declaration and or return required under the
Ordinance, its business allocation percentage is 100 percent; in other words
the taxpayer is required to pay a tax of one percent- (1%) on the entire net
profit of the business.
      (2)   If the taxpayer had a place or places of business outside Edgerton
and was doing business in Edgerton during such period, the business allocation
percentage shall be computed on the basis as set forth in
181.02(h).
      (3)   The Business allocation percentage is computed by determining the
percentages:
         A.   Which Edgerton real and tangible personal property bears to all
real and tangible personal property (including that situated in Edgerton) of
taxpayer wheresoever situated;
         B.   Which Edgerton business sales bear to taxpayer's entire business
sales wheresoever derived (including those derived from Edgerton); and
         C.   Which payrolls paid by taxpayer within Edgerton bear to
taxpayer's entire payroll wheresoever paid (including Edgerton payrolls);
adding together the three percentages so arrived at/and dividing the total by
three.
      (4)   However, if one of the factors (property, sales or payrolls) is
missing, the other two percentages are added and the sum is divided by two, and
if two of the factors are missing, the remaining percentage is the business
allocation-percentage.
         Example 1:
   Corporation having places of business in Edgerton, Detroit and Cleveland.
   Edgerton real and tangible personal property $10,000. All real and personal
property (Edgerton, Detroit and Cleveland) $100,000. Percentage: 10%
   Edgerton sales $15,000. All sales $75,000. Percentage: 20%
   Edgerton payroll $6,000. All payroll $20,000. Percentage: 30%
         Business Allocation Percentage:
 
10% plus 20% plus 30%  Equals 20%
         3
 
         Example 2:
   Same corporation owning no real or tangible personal property anywhere.
Edgerton sales $15,000. All sales $75,000. Percentage: 20%
   Edgerton payroll $6,000. All payroll $20,000. Percentage: 30%
         Business Allocation Percentage:
 
20% plus 30%     Equals 25%
      2
 
         Example 3:
   Same corporation owning real and tangible personal property in Edgerton
valued at $10,000 and owning no real or tangible personal property outside
Edgerton. Other factors same as in Examples 1 and 2.
         Business Allocation Percentage:
 
100% plus 20% plus 30%     Equals 50%
         3
 
      (5)   After determining such business allocation percentage, the tax
shall be determined by applying that percentage to the entire net profits of
the taxpayer, wherever derived (thus arriving at the taxable net profit), and
computing one percent (1%) of the resultant taxable net profit.
      (6)   In case it shall appear to the Village Clerk that any income or
capital of the taxpayer is improperly or inaccurately reflected, the Village
Clerk may adjust items of income, expense, deductions and capital, and
disregard assets in computing any allocation percentage, provided any income
directly traceable thereto is also excluded from entire net income, so as
equitably to determine the tax.
   (b)   Explanation of “Property Factor”. The percentage of the taxpayer's
real and tangible personal property within Edgerton is determined by dividing
the net book value (during the period covered by the report) of such property
within Edgerton, without deduction of any encumbrances, by the average net book
value similarly computed, of all such property within and without Edgerton.
Only property owned by the taxpayer is considered in determining such
percentage.
   (c)   Explanation of Sales Factor. Receipts from the following are allocable
to Edgerton:
      (1)   Work done and performed or services rendered in Edgerton.
      (2)   Rentals from property situated in Edgerton, where the rental of
such property is a usual or normal part of the taxpayer's business activity.
      (3)   For the purpose of determining business allocation percentage, no
account shall be given to receipts, within or without Edgerton, of income
derived from intangibles (including stocks, bonds, royalties and the like) the
income of which is taxable under the statutes of the State of Ohio.
      (4)   Compensation and other receipts for work done or services performed
within Edgerton are allocable to Edgerton and taxable under the Ordinance. All
amounts so received, credited or charged by taxpayer in payment for such work
or services are so allocable, irrespective of whether done or performed by
employees or agents of taxpayer or by any other person. It is immaterial where
such amounts were payable or where they were received.
         A.   Commission or fees received by the taxpayer are allocated to
Edgerton if the services for which the commissions were paid were performed in
Edgerton. If the taxpayer's services for which commissions or fees were paid
were performed for the taxpayer by salesmen or other agents or employees
attached to or working out of an Edgerton place of business of the taxpayer,
the taxpayer's services will be deemed to have been performed in Edgerton.
         B.   Where a lump sum is received by the taxpayer in payment for
services within and without Edgerton, the amount attributable to services
within Edgerton is to be determined on the basis of the relative values of, or
amounts of time spent in the performance of, such services within and without
Edgerton.
      (5)   Receipts from sale of capital assets (property not held by the
taxpayer for sale to customers in the regular course of business) are not
business receipts. Receipts from the sale of real property held by the taxpayer
as a dealer for sale to customers in the regular course of business, are
business receipts and are allocable to Edgerton if the real property was
situated in Edgerton. Receipts from sale of intangibles included in business
capital, held by the taxpayer as a dealer for sale to customers in the regular
course of business are business receipts and are allocable to Edgerton if the
sales were made in Edgerton or through a regular place of business of the
taxpayer in Edgerton.
   (d)   Payroll Factor. The percentage of the taxpayer's payroll allocable to
Edgerton is determined by dividing the wages, salaries and other personal
service compensation of the taxpayer's employees within Edgerton during the
period covered by the report, by the total amount of compensation of all
taxpayer's employees during such period.
      (1)   Wages, salaries and other compensation are computed on the cash or
accrual basis in accordance with the method of accounting used in the
computation of the entire net income of the taxpayer.
      (2)   Employees within Edgerton usually includes all employees regularly
connected with or working out of a place of business maintained by the taxpayer
in Edgerton.
      (3)   However, where an employee performed services both within and
without Edgerton, the amount treated as compensation for services performed
within Edgerton shall be deemed to be:
         A.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends directly on
the volume of business secured by him, such as a salesman on a commission
basis, the amount received by him for the business attributable to his efforts
within Edgerton;
         B.   In the case of an employee whose compensation depends on other
results achieved, the proportion of the total compensation which the value of
his services within Edgerton bears to the value of all his services; and
         C.   In the case of an employee compensated on a time basis, the
proportion of the total amount received by him which the working time employed
in Edgerton bears to the total working time.
   (e)   Adjustment of Business Allocation Percentage Formula. Generally, the
Business Allocation Percentage Formula will result in a fair apportionment of
the taxpayer's net profits within and without Edgerton. However, due to the
peculiar circumstances of certain businesses, the formula may work a hardship
in some cases or result in a tax evasion in others, thus not do justice to the
taxpayer or the Village. Accordingly, in such cases, the Village Clerk may
substitute factors calculated to bring about a fair and proper allocation in
any case where the taxpayer has adopted the optional use of the business
allocation percentage formula.
(Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.09  ON WHAT EARNINGS OR NET PROFITS TAX FIRST LEVIED.
   (a)   The tax referred to in Sections
183.03 and
183.04 shall first be levied, collected and paid with respect to the salaries,

earned on and after January 1, 1972, and to and including December 31, 1975.
   (b)   The tax referred to in Sections
183.05,

accordance with the regular accounting system of taxpayer as approved by the
Director of Internal Revenue) from and after January 1, 1972, and to and
including December 31, 1974.
   (c)   But see Section
183.10 for fiscal year returns.
(Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.10 FISCAL YEARS.
   (a)   Where the fiscal year of a trade, business, profession, enterprise,
undertaking and/or other activity differs from the calendar year, the tax shall
be applicable to the net profits of the fiscal year, but for the first fiscal
year with respect only such portion thereof as was earned on and after January
1, 1972.
   (b)   A fiscal year will be recognized only if it has been or may be
recognized as such by the Director of Internal Revenue for the purpose of
Federal Income Tax.
(Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.11  NET BUSINESS PROFITS.
   In amplification of the definition of the term "Net Profits" as set forth in
Section
181.01(g), but not in limitation thereof, the following additional information
and requirements respecting net business profits are furnished:
   (a)   Where necessary to properly reflect income, inventories must be used.
The basis of pricing used for the purpose of the Federal Income Tax must in
each instance be used.
   (b)   Where the books and records are kept on an "Accrual Basis", "Long-Term
Contract Basis," or "Installment Basis", and said basis is used in the filing
of Federal Income Tax Returns, the same basis must be used for the purpose of
this tax.
   (c)   If the return is made on a "cash basis", Gross Profit shall include
(1) commissions, fees and interest earned, plus (2) the gross profit or loss
from sales of merchandise, chattels, goods, wares, securities, notes, chooses-
in-action and services, except as hereinafter provided.
   (d)   If the return is made on an "accrual basis", Gross Profit shall
include (1) commissions, fees and interest earned, plus (2) the gross profit or
loss from sales of merchandise, chattels, goods, wares, securities, notes,
chooses-in-action and services, except as hereinafter provided.
   (e)   From Gross Profit there shall be subtracted allowable expense to
arrive at the net profits subject to tax.
   (f)   All ordinary and necessary expense of doing business, including
reasonable compensation paid employees, shall be allowed (but no deduction may
be claimed for "salary" or withdrawals of a proprietor or of the partners,
members or other co- owners of an unincorporated business or enterprise).
   (g)   If not claimed as part of the Cost of Goods Sold or elsewhere in the
return filed, there may be claimed and allowed a reasonable deduction for
depreciation, depletion, obsolescence, losses resulting from theft or casualty
not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, of property used in the trade or
business, but the amount may not exceed that recognized for the purpose of the
Federal Income Tax.
   (h)   Bad Debts in a reasonable amount may be allowed in the year
ascertained worthless and charged off, but in no event shall the amount allowed
exceed the amount recognized as a deduction for the purpose of the Federal
Income Tax.
   (i)   Only taxes directly connected with the taxpayer's business may be
claimed as a deduction. If for any reason the income from property is not
subject to tax, then the tax on and other expenses of said property are not
deductible. In any event, the following taxes are not deductible from income:
      (1)   The tax under the Ordinance;
      (2)    Any Federal taxes based upon income;
      (3)    Gifts, estate or inheritance taxes, and
      (4)    Taxes and/or special assessments for local benefits or
improvements to property which tend to appreciate the value thereof.
   (j)   Capital gains and losses (including gains or losses from the sale,
exchange, or other disposition of depreciable business property, and real
property used in the taxpayer's trade or business) shall not be taken into
consideration in arriving at Net Profits Earned.
   (k)   If the taxpayer is a non-resident, only the amount of net profits
applicable to the activities of the business in Edgerton shall be subjected to
tax. If the non-resident taxpayer's records do not disclose the actual net
profits for the Edgerton Branch, office, store, or activity, separately, then
the basis of allocation shall be disclosed in the return. If such basis of
allocation is not deemed correct, in view of all the known circumstances, the
Village Clerk will make a reallocation based upon gross receipts or any other
basis which shall, under the circumstances of the case, more accurately reflect
the net profits.
   (l)   In general, all business expense recognized and to the extent allowed
as such for the purpose of determining Federal Income Tax will be recognized
and allowed for determining Edgerton Income Tax under the provisions of the
Ordinance. However, all expense connected with the acquisition or carrying of
securities, the income from which is not recognized as taxable under the
Ordinance, may not be deducted in determining taxable net profits hereunder.
   (m)   In general, unearned income is not to be included in computing the tax
levied hereunder. Income from intangibles by way of dividends, interest and the
like, should not be included if the property from which such income is derived
is subject to taxation under the Intangible Personal Property Tax Laws of the
State of Ohio, or is specifically exempted from taxation under said laws.
   (n)   Rentals received by the taxpayer are to be included only if and to the
extent that the rental, ownership, management or operation of the real estate
from which such rentals are derived (whether so rented, managed or operated by
taxpayer individually or through agents or other representatives) constitutes a
business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in part.
Following are the circumstances under which, in any instance, the rental of any
real property shall or shall not be deemed to be a “Business Activity”:
      (1)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of $100.00 per month, it
shall be prima facie evidence that the rental, ownership, management or
operation of such properties is a business activity of such taxpayer, and the
net income of such rental property shall be subject to tax; provided that in
case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a
business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or fluctuating percentage
of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the lessee, whether or not such
rental exceeds $100.00 per month; provided further that in the case of farm
property, the owner shall be considered engaged in a business activity when he
share in the crops or when the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or
net receipts derived from the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds
$100.00 per month; and provided further that the person who operates a rooming
house shall be considered in business whether or not the gross income exceeds
$100.00 per month.
      (2)   In determining the amount of gross monthly rental of any real
property, periods during which (by reason of vacancy or any other cause)
rentals are not received shall not be taken into consideration by the taxpayer.
      (3)   Rentals received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of buying
and selling real estate shall be considered as part of business income.
      (4)   Real property, as the term is used in this chapter, shall include
commercial property, residential property, farm property, and any and all other
types of real estate.
      (5)   In determining the taxable net income from rentals, the deductible
expense shall be of the same nature, extent and amount as are allowed by the
Internal Revenue Department for Federal Income Tax purposes.
      (6)   Residents of Edgerton are subject to taxation upon net income from
rentals (to the extent above specified) on all properties located in Edgerton,
and on all properties located outside Edgerton, the net income of which is not
subject to city income tax in said other community. In the case of residents of
Edgerton, if the net income of properties located outside Edgerton is subject
to City income tax in another community, then said net income will not be
subject to village income tax in Edgerton.
   Non-residents of Edgerton are subject to such taxation only if the real
property is situated within the Village of Edgerton. Nonresidents, in
determining whether gross monthly rentals exceed $100.00, shall take into
consideration only real estate situated within Edgerton.
   (o)   Income from royalties or copyrights is not to be included.
      (Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.12  RECONCILIATION WITH FEDERAL RETURN.
   (a)   In a form satisfactory to the Village Clerk, there shall be submitted
with each return filed by a taxpayer subject to the Federal Income Tax, a
reconciliation between the amount shown in the return filed with the Village
Clerk and the business income reported to the Federal Internal Revenue
Department.
   (b)   If, as a result of a change made in business income by the Federal
Internal Revenue Department, or by a judicial decision, an additional amount
will result as owing to the Village of Edgerton, a report of such change shall
be filed by the taxpayer within thirty days after receipt of the final notice
of such change from the Federal Authorities or after final decision of a court
adjudicating any such Federal Income Tax liability.
(Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.13  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   On or before April 15, 1973, every taxpayer engaged in any business,
the net profits of which are subject in whole or in part to the tax imposed by
the Ordinance, shall make and file with the Village Clerk a final return on a
form furnished by or obtainable from the Village Clerk. Thereafter, each such
taxpayer shall, on or before April 15 of each subsequent year, make and file a
final return with the Village Clerk. Like returns shall be filed at the same
time and in the same manner by all persons whose wages, salaries, bonuses,
incentive payments, commissions, fees and other compensation received during
the preceding taxable year are subject to the tax imposed by the Ordinance.
However, where an employee's entire earnings for the year are paid by an
employer and the Edgerton tax thereon has in each instance been withheld and
deducted by the employer from the gross amount of the entire earnings of such
employee-taxpayer and where the employer of such employee has filed a report or
return in which such employee's entire and only earnings are reported to the
Village Clerk, and where such employee has no taxable income other than such
earnings, it shall not be necessary for such employee to file a return for any
taxable year in which such conditions have prevailed.
   Any person who receives both compensation for services performed for an
employer, in whatsoever form, and in addition receives income from any business
activity or occupation not subject to withholding under the Ordinance, must
file a declaration and a final return.
   (b)   In all returns filed hereunder there shall be set forth the aggregate
amount of salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive payments, commissions, fees and
other compensation received and/or net profits earned (all as hereinbefore
defined) by and during the preceding year and subject to said tax, together
with such pertinent information as the Village Clerk may require.
   (c)   If the return is made for a fiscal year or for any period other than a
calendar year, the said return shall be made within three and one-half months
from the end of said fiscal year.
   (d)   The return shall also show the amount of the tax imposed by the
Ordinance on such earnings, or net profits, or both.
   (e)   The taxpayer making the return shall at the time of filing thereof,
pay the Village Clerk the amount of tax shown to be due and unpaid by the
return. If, pursuant to the provisions of Section
183.15, the taxpayer has at the time of making such final return overpaid his
tax, such taxpayer shall show the amount of overpayment and may in said return
either (1) request a refund therefor, or (2) request that the amount thereof be
credited against the amount which will be required to be paid by taxpayer on
the next succeeding installment of tax which may become due.
   (f)   Where any portion of the tax otherwise due shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Sections
183.14 and
183.18, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, pursuant
to Section
181.04, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown
to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing said final return.
   (g)   Upon written request of the taxpayer, the Village Clerk may extend the
time for filing the annual return for a period of not more than six (6) months
or not more than thirty (30) days beyond any extension requested of and granted
by the Federal Internal Revenue Department for the filing of the Federal Income
Tax return.
   For payments in installments, see Section
183.19.
(Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.14 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   It is the duty of each employer (as hereinbefore defined) who employs
one or more persons on a salary, wage, commission, or other compensation basis,
to deduct from compensation paid to any employee subject to the Ordinance, the
tax of one percent (1%) of such salary, wage, bonus, incentive payment,
commission or other compensation due by said employer to said employee. The tax
shall be deducted by the employer from:
      (1)   All compensation paid to employees who are nonresidents of the
Village of Edgerton for services rendered, work performed, or other activities
engaged in to earn such compensation, within the Village of Edgerton; and
      (2)   From the gross amount of all salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive
payments, commissions or other form of compensation paid to employees who are
residents of the Village of Edgerton, regardless of the place where the
services are rendered.
   (b)   All employers who or which maintain an office or of her place of
business in Edgerton are required to make the collections and deductions in
this article specified, regardless of the fact that the services on account of
which any particular deduction is required as to residents of the Village of
Edgerton, were performed at a place of business of any such employer situated
outside the Village of Edgerton.
   (c)   The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the tax on the
compensation received.
   (d)   Commissions and fees paid to professional men, brokers, and others who
are independent contractors and not employees of the payor, are not subject to
withholding or collection of the tax at the source. Such taxpayers must in all
instances file returns and pay the tax pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.02. (See Sections
183.05 and
183.06). 
   (e)   In the case of employees who are non-residents of Edgerton, the amount
to be deducted is one percent (1%) of the compensation paid with respect to
personal services rendered in Edgerton.
   Where a non-resident receives compensation for personal services rendered or
performed partly within and partly outside Edgerton, the withholding employer
shall deduct, withhold and remit that portion of the compensation which is
earned within Edgerton in accordance with the following rules of apportionment.
      (1)   If the non-resident is a salesman, agent, or other employee whose
compensation on the basis of commissions depends directly on the volume of
business transacted by him, the deducting and withholding shall attach to the
portion of the entire compensation which the volume of business transacted by
the employee within the Village of Edgerton bears to the volume of business
transacted by him within and outside the Village of Edgerton.
      (2)   The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation of
all other employees (including officers of corporations) shall attach to the
portion of the personal service compensation of such employee which the total
number of working days employed within the Village of Edgerton bears to the
total number of working days employed within and outside the Village of
Edgerton.
      (3)   If it is impossible to apportion the earnings as provided above,
because of:
         A.   The peculiar nature of the service of the employee, or
         B.   The unusual basis of compensation, apportionment shall be made in
accordance with the facts and the tax deducted and withheld accordingly.
      (4)   The occasional entry into the Village of Edgerton of a nonresident
employee who performs the duties for which he is employed entirely outside the
Village, but enters the Village for the purpose of reporting, receiving
instructions, accounting, etc., incidental to his duties outside the Village,
shall not be deemed to take such employee out of the class of those rendering
their services entirely outside the Village.
   (f)   An employer shall withhold the tax on the full amount of any advances
made to an employee on account of commissions (whether by way of drawing
account or otherwise but see subsection (g) below) where such advances are in
excess of commissions earned.
   (g)   An employer required to withhold the tax on compensation paid to an
employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be withheld,
ignore any amount allowed and paid by the employer to the employee for expense
necessarily and actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of
his services, provided, that such expense must be of the kind and in the amount
recognized and allowed as deductible expense for Federal Income Tax purposes.
(Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.15  RETURNS OF TAX WITHHELD AND PAYMENT.
   (a)   The deduction from salaries, wages and other compensation required to
be made by employers are to begin with compensation earned on and after January
1, 1972. The first return and payment required to be made on account of such
deductions shall be made, filed and paid to the Village Clerk between April 1,
1972 and April 30, 1972.
   (b)   Each employer within the Village of Edgerton who employs one or more
persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis shall deduct
monthly, or more often than monthly, and at the time of the payment of such
salary, wage, commission, or other compensation, the tax of one percent (1%) of
salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by the said employer to
the said employee and shall make a return and pay to the Village Clerk the
amount of taxes so deducted as follows:
   For the three (3) months ending March 31st, on or before April 30th;
   For the three (3) months ending June 30th, on or before July 31st;
   For the three (3) months ending September 30th, on or before October 31st;
   For the three (3) months ending December 31st, on or before the following
January 31st.
   (c)   The reporting periods referred to in the preceding paragraphs are
elastic to this extent: The employer will use the same quarterly accounting
period for reporting taxes withheld under the Edgerton Income Tax Ordinance as
he uses in reporting quarterly taxes withheld to the Federal Government.
   (d)   Said return shall be on a form prescribed by and obtainable from the
Village Clerk and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
therefor by the Village Clerk.
   (e)   For adjustment of errors in returns of tax withheld by employers see
Section
183.21. (Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.16 LIMITATION ON CREDIT FOR TAX PAID AT SOURCE.
   The failure of any employer, residing either within or outside the Village
of Edgerton, to collect the tax and to make any return prescribed herein, shall
not relieve the employee from the payment of such tax in compliance with these
Regulations respecting the making of returns and the payment of taxes. (Res.
10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.17 STATUS AND LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS.
   (a)   Every employer is deemed to be a trustee of the Village of Edgerton in
collecting and holding the tax required under the Ordinance to be withheld, and
the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds until
the same is paid to the Village of Edgerton.
   (b)   Every such employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the
source is liable directly to the Village of Edgerton for the payment of such
tax, whether actually collected by such employer or not. (Res. 10-1971. Passed
12-27-71.)
183.18 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   An employee whose entire wages, salaries, or other compensation for
any taxable year will be subjected to the withholding provisions under Section
183.14, whose tax will accordingly be withheld as to his entire earnings for
such year by his employer, and who during such taxable year expects to derive
no other compensation or other income which is subject to tax under the
Ordinance, need not file a declaration as provided in this chapter.
   (b)   All other taxpayers (as defined in the Ordinance and in these
regulations) subject to the taxes imposed in Section
181.02, and every taxpayer who anticipates any income or net profits not
subject to total withholding as provided in the next preceding paragraph, shall
file with the Village Clerk a declaration of his estimated tax as follows:
      (1)   On or before April 15, 1972, every such calendar year taxpayer
shall file a declaration of his estimated tax for the taxable period beginning
January 1, 1972, and ending December 31, 1972.
      (2)   A similar declaration shall be filed by each such calendar year
taxpayer on or before the 15th day of April of each subsequent year during the
life of the Ordinance, and each such declaration shall contain a statement of
the taxpayer's estimated tax for the full taxable year in which such
declaration is filed.
   (c)   Taxpayers who or which are permitted, pursuant to the provisions of
Section
183.10,to return and pay their tax upon a fiscal year basis, shall file their
first declaration within three and one-half months after the beginning of the
first fiscal year beginning on and after January 1, 1972, and the subsequent
declaration for each year thereafter on or before the 15th day of the fourth
month following the beginning of each such fiscal year. Those taxpayers on a
fiscal year basis shall make quarterly payments on or before the 15th day of
the fourth month and on or before the last day of the sixth, ninth and twelfth
month following the beginning of such fiscal year. The first installment, equal
to at least one-fourth of the estimated tax, must accompany the
declaration.
   (d)   The estimated tax for a calendar year taxpayer may be paid in full
with the filing of the declaration or in equal installments on or before April
15, June 30, September 30, and December 31.
   (e)   The declarations so required shall be filed upon a form furnished by
or obtainable from the Village Clerk. Any taxpayer who has filed an estimate
for Federal income tax purposes may, in making the declaration, required
hereunder, simply state therein that the figures therein contained are the same
figures used by the taxpayer in making the declaration of his estimate for the
Federal Income Tax. However, in addition to such statement, any such taxpayer
may, in such declaration, modify and adjust such declared income so as to
exclude therefrom income which is not subject to tax under the Ordinance.
   (f)   Any estimate filed hereunder may be amended by the filing of an
amended estimate at the time prescribed for the payment of any installment of
tax paid in accordance with Section
183.19. (Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.19 PAYMENT OF TAX INSTALLMENTS.
   (a)   At the time of filing each declaration (required by Section
183.18) each taxpayer shall pay to the Village Clerk one-fourth (1/4) of the
amount of his estimated annual tax. Thereafter, on or before the 30th day of
June, September and December 31st of each year during the life of the
Ordinance, such taxpayer shall pay at least a similar amount. However, if any
such taxpayer shall, on or before any such payment date, file an amended
declaration showing an increase or decrease of the estimated tax, the
installments then and thereafter due shall be increased or diminished (as the
case may be) in such manner that the balance of the estimated tax shall be
fully paid on or before December 31st of the taxable year involved through the
payment of quarterly installments in equal amounts during the quarterly periods
remaining from and after the filing of any such amended declaration.
   (b)   Taxpayers who or which are permitted to make returns and pay their tax
on a fiscal year basis (see Section
183.10), may make the quarterly payments on their declaration of estimated tax
pursuant to Section
183.18(e).
   (c)   For final returns and final adjustment of tax due, see Section
183.13.
(Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.20 RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY EMPLOYERS AND TAXPAYERS.
   Employers and others subject to the tax under the Ordinance are required to
keep such records as will enable the filing of true and accurate returns,
whether of taxes withheld at source or of taxes payable upon earnings or net
profits, or both, and such records are to be preserved to enable the Village
Clerk, or any agent or employee of the Village Clerk, to verify the correctness
of the returns filed. (Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)
183.21 COLLECTION OF DEFICIENCIES; ALLOWANCE OF CREDIT FOR OVERPAYMENT.
   (a)   If, as a result of investigation conducted by the Village Clerk, a
return is found to be incorrect, the Village Clerk is authorized to assess and
collect any underpayment of tax withheld at source or any underpayment of tax
owing by any taxpayer with respect to earnings or net profits, or both. If no
return has been filed and a tax is found to be owing, the tax actually owing
may be assessed and collected with or without the formality of obtaining a
delinquent return from the employer or taxpayer.
   (b)   Should it be disclosed, either as a result of an investigation by the
Village Clerk or through the medium of the filing of a claim or petition for
refund or credit, that an overpayment has been made, the Village Clerk will
refund such overpayment.
   (c)   The employer will in every instance be required to pay the full tax
which should have been withheld, even though he may fail to withhold from the
employee. If too much has been withheld the excess shall be refunded by the
employer to the employee. While the withholding agent (employer) will be
expected to maintain complete records of such adjustments with the employees,
any such adjustment made during any month will not need to be reflected in the
withholding return or disclosed by schedules or statements thereto attached.
   (d)   In those cases in which too much has been withheld by an employer from
an employee and remitted to the Village Clerk and there has been a termination
of the employee- employer relationship, the taxpayer (employee) may obtain an
adjustment by application to the Village Clerk. (Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-
71.)
183.22  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by the Ordinance remaining unpaid when the same have
become due, together with all interest and penalties thereon, become a debt due
the Village from the taxpayer, and are recoverable as other debts by suit
instituted by the Village Solicitor.
   (b)   Employers who or which, although obliged under the Ordinance to
withhold and remit to the Village Clerk the taxes required to be withheld at
the source (Section
183.14), shall fail to so withhold and/or remit, become liable to the Village
in a civil action to enforce the payment of the debt created by such failure.
   (c)   When a final return is filed as prescribed in Section
183.13 hereof and a deficiency is determined to be due the Village of Edgerton,
action to collect the same must be brought within three (3) years after the tax
was due or the return was filed, whichever is later. However, in the case of
fraud, failure to file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more
of income required to be reported, prosecution may be commenced within six (6)
years after the commission of the offense. (Res. 10-1971. Passed 12-27-71.)

183.25 SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax against
any individual or any of the several groups specified herein, is found to be
unconstitutional, illegal, or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or
invalidity shall affect only such sentence, clause, section or part of this
chapter and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions,

1972, said payroll shall be considered a split payroll, and as such said
payroll will not be subject to withholding tax under Edgerton Village Income

   (A)   The tax on income and the withholding tax established by this Chapter

tax on income and the withholding tax established by this Chapter
185 are deemed to be levied in accordance with, and to be consistent with, the

deemed to incorporate the provisions of ORC 718.
   (B)   The tax is an annual tax levied on the income of every person residing
in or earning or receiving income in the municipal corporation, and shall be
measured by municipal taxable income. The Municipality shall tax income at a
uniform rate. The tax is levied on Municipal Taxable Income, as defined herein.
(Ord. 967. Passed 12-8-15.)
185.012 PURPOSES OF TAX; RATE.

   2.    Rate of tax. All income subject to taxation by the Municipality

185.014 STATEMENT OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY; STATE MANDATED CHANGES TO MUNICIPAL
INCOME TAX.
   (A)   Significant and wide-ranging amendments to ORC 718 were enacted by Am
Sub HB 5, passed by the 130th General Assembly, and signed by Governor Kasich
on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal corporations to conform to
and adopt the provisions of ORC 718 in order to have the authority to impose,
enforce, administer and collect a municipal income tax.
   (B)   As mandated by H.B. 5, municipal income tax Ordinance 967, effective
January 1, 2016, comprehensively amends Chapter 185 in accordance with the
provisions of ORC 718 to allow the Municipality to continue the income tax and
withholding tax administration and collection efforts on behalf of the

and succeeding taxable years.
   (B)   Ordinance 967 does not repeal the existing sections of Chapters
181 and
183 for any taxable year prior to 2016, but rather adopts Chapter
185. For municipal taxable years beginning before January 1, 2016, the
Municipality shall continue to administer, audit, and enforce the income tax of
the Municipality under ORC 718 and ordinances and resolutions of the
Municipality as that chapter and those ordinances and resolutions existed
before January 1, 2016. For taxable years beginning 2016, Chapters

183 shall remain effective for taxable years beginning 2016, but only to the
extent not inconsistent with Chapter
185 or other applicable law.

qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following

         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) or (B)(1)(c) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of each
month.
      (c)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted on behalf of the Municipality in the preceding
calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if

         (i)   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be

         (ii)   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first

day of that month.
      (d)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under section
185.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or form 1099, or an equivalent form with respect to
such employee, and other information as may be required by the Tax
Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal

employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
185.051 of this Chapter.

performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)

used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
185.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
185.051 of this Chapter.
   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (D) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal services at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no

liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041

be indicated on the annual return.

require that such copies be transmitted electronically.

are due.
         If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net

   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (B) and (I) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
185.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the

same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
185.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
185.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section 185.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
185.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (I)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an employee for
the performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (I)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (A) and (B) of this section apply to such
apportionment except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.
         Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new
election under this division after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(A)(1) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (I)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (A)(1) of this section, the average
original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying remote
employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location shall be
sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (A)(2) of this section, any wages,
salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a qualifying
remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying
remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting
location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (A)(3) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (D) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)   Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (B) of this section. However, a tax administrator shall
not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
under this Chapter.

185.063 CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.

section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
         (b)   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (B)(2) of this section; or
         (c)   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return in
the same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
185.03(1) of this Chapter, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable
income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
185.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
185.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
185.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
185.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
185.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (H)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

185.064 TAX CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT FOSTER NEW JOBS IN OHIO.
   The Municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable
credit against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.

derives from the retained employees of the taxpayer, and shall be for a term
not exceeding fifteen years. Before the Municipality passes an ordinance
allowing such a credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an
agreement specifying all the conditions of the credit.
(Ord. 967. Passed 12-8-15.)
185.07 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX.
   (A)    As used in this section:

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars. For the
purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division

   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the

liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth day of the first
month of the following taxable year, ninety percent of the tax liability for

fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the taxable year, ninety per cent of the
tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
185.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section
185.10 of this Chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by

         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
185.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

or other personal service compensation, for work done, or services performed or
rendered outside of said Village, if it be made to appear that the individual
taxpayer has paid an Ohio municipal income tax on such net profits, salaries,
wages, commissions or other compensation to another municipality, shall be
allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter of amount so paid by
the individual taxpayer to such other municipality. The credit shall not exceed
the tax assessed by this chapter on such income, net profit, salary, wages,
commissions or compensation earned in such other municipality or municipalities
where such tax is paid.
   (B)   As used in this section, the word "municipality" shall mean an Ohio
city or village, but no other political subdivision. (Ord. 967. Passed 12-8-

185.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 967. Passed 12-8-15.)
185.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
185.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 967. Passed 12-8-15.)
185.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
185.096 of this Chapter.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
185.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
185.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
185.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. (Ord.
967. Passed 12-8-15.)

EJCITI program, including the responsibility for the creation of proposed
program applications and any standards, all of which shall be approved by
council.
   (c)    Any tax incentives or credits granted in accordance with this

   (A)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under subsection
185.051(C) of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole

individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust. Such fiduciary

return or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the
refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with

      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division

         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
185.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
185.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
185.092 of this Chapter prevails.

      (3)    (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Municipality income tax
ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with the
Municipality for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in Section
185.052(A)(6)) within the Municipality.
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in Municipality and
does not expect to be subject to Municipality income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the Municipality. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the Municipality, make any sales in the Municipality, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the Municipality during the
taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
Municipality for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the Municipality income tax
ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)    This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or (c) of Section
185.051 of this Chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the time
stamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in section
185.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)    When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

meaning as in section
185.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
         The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also shall
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
      (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an
audit of the person. (Ord. 1009. Passed 12-18-17.)
185.092 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX; INDIVIDUALS SERVING IN COMBAT ZONE.
   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active

civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall

(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-first day after
the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. (Ord. 967. Passed 12-8-15.)
185.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)    The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)    Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax. (Ord. 967. Passed 12-8-15.)
185.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE. 
   (A)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates. For
tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended due date of
Municipality's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual shall
be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)    Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)    An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)    If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal
income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the state
income tax return.

      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the

shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
185.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. (Ord. 967. Passed 12-8-15.)
185.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section 185.18 of this
Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the

was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D) Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
185.10 of this Chapter.

any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other

the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction

Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
185.10 of this Chapter.

section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to

interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
185.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 967. Passed 12-8-15.)
185.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. (Ord. 967. Passed 12-8-15.)
185.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
         Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing. Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code. For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 967. Passed 12-8-15.)
185.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
185.18 of this Chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
185.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
185.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
185.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 967. Passed 12-8-15.)

pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator, to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on

(Ord. 967. Passed 12-8-15.)
185.21 LIMITATION ON CREDIT FOR TAX PAID AT SOURCE.
   The failure of any employer, residing either within or outside the Village
of Edgerton, to collect the tax and to make any return prescribed herein, shall
not relieve the employee from the payment of such tax in compliance with these
Regulations respecting the making of returns and the payment of taxes. (Ord.
967. Passed 12-8-15.)
185.22 STATUS AND LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS.
   (A )   Every employer is deemed to be a trustee of the Village of Edgerton

until the same is paid to the Village of Edgerton.
 
   (B)   Every such employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the
source is liable directly to the Village of Edgerton for the payment of such
tax, whether actually collected by such employer or not. (Ord. 967. Passed 12-

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle. However, if
the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation has
established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing
service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available

   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private

person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self
as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information
pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under subsection

shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under

subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the chief
to be necessary to a criminal investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (4)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken

the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the law enforcement agency of the
municipal corporation concerning all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be

who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self as the
owner, operator or lienholder of the vehicle, and requests information
pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three business days of the removal, the towing
service or storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause

   (a)   The chief of a law enforcement agency of the municipal corporation,
within the chief’s respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway
patrol trooper, upon notification to the chief of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63,
that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the chief, or state highway patrol
trooper as a result of the performance of the chief’s or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the

         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to Ohio
R.C. 4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
         B.   The vehicle is a commercial motor vehicle. If the vehicle is a

time, the chief, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (c) of this section, the chief shall
designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered removed.
   (b)   If the chief, or a state highway patrol trooper issues an order under

removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the chief shall send or
cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at the owner’s or lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested, by
certified mail with electronic tracking, or by a commercial carrier service
utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed receipt. The notice shall

nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten days of the date of the
sending of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal

retrieving the vehicle and without paying any fee. However, a towing service or
storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the
owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or
storage facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69
(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
chief, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to be necessary to a
criminal investigation;
            2.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger

         B.   For purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section, “personal
items” do not include any items that are attached to the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this section, and the search
was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the motor
vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay to the
place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), in addition
to any expenses or charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at a public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief, without charge to any
party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county in which the place of
storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the requirements of
this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the Clerk, without charge,
shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, to the chief. If the vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor
vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62 or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the chief shall execute in
triplicate an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles,
describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and
that all requirements of this section have been complied with. The chief shall
retain the original of the affidavit for the chief’s records, and shall furnish
two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, shall issue a
salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two hours without the permission of the person having the right to
the possession of the property or on a public street or other property open to

right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight hours or longer, without
notification to the chief of the law enforcement agency of the municipal
corporation of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the Municipality.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of

guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred

evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant

authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).

this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for

4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver’s
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a term of community
service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an offender to complete a
term of community service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect
criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in
the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

registrar shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of
registration of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the
declaration of forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five
years after the date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having

by the person or to transfer registration of the vehicle.
   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and

restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

charged with a violation of subsection (a) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of driving
under suspension and shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this
section.
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)(2) of this section,
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. The offender shall be sentenced

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio

economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during or
after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under this
section. (ORC 4510.111)
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in

commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
 501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 RECOVERY OF CONFINEMENT COSTS.
   (a)   All persons convicted under an ordinance of the Municipality of an
offense other than a minor misdemeanor and who are confined in a prison, jail,
station, or other facility shall reimburse the Municipality for expenses
incurred as a result of their confinement. Expenses incurred include, but are
not limited to, the costs of the provision of food, clothing, shelter and
medical expenses, accrued during the time of incarceration and during the time
so served in a local jail or other facility.
   (b)   The amount of reimbursement to be made by each person shall be
determined at a separate hearing, conducted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15.
Before the hearing on reimbursement, the presiding Judge shall investigate or
cause to be investigated the person’s ability to pay. The financial
capabilities of the person are to be examined in light of the following
factors’ however, such factors are not to be limited to:
      (1)   The financial resources, excluding the funds saved from wages
derived from his labor or employment during the period of incarceration;
      (2)   Any obligation of support for his dependents;
      (3)   Any obligations to make reimbursement to the victim of the offense
for which he is convicted;
      (4)   His income, assets, liabilities, ability to borrow, household
expenses, and any other factors that may affect his ability to make
reimbursement.
   (c)   The amount to be reimbursed to the Municipality shall be the actual
cost of confinement, up to but not exceeding forty dollars ($40.00) per person
per day, as the same may from time to time be determined by action of the
Williams County Commissioners. At the present time, this amount is thirty
dollars ($30.00) per day, plus any medical expenses.
   (d)   The Solicitor, upon authorization of the government, shall institute
an appropriate civil action, as deemed necessary, in the name of the
Municipality, in the Court of Common Pleas to recover from all and any persons
incarcerated in a jail, prison, station, or other facility, the confinement of
which renders the Municipality liable for care, maintenance, and support; the
amount determined by a court, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.15. The action shall
be brought within one (1) year after the release of a person so incarcerated.
The amount recovered shall be paid into the treasury of the Municipality. (Ord.
490. Passed 9-23-85.)
501.14 CREDIT UPON FINES FOR JAIL SENTENCE.
   Where a fine may be imposed in whole or in part in punishment of a violation
of an ordinance and the judge or magistrate has authority to order that the
defendant stand committed to the jail of the county or municipal corporation
until the fine is paid, the court may order that such person stand committed to
such jail or workhouse until such fine is paid or secured to be paid or is
otherwise legally discharged. Persons so imprisoned shall receive credit upon
such fine at the rate of ten dollars ($10.00) per day. (Ord. 248. Passed 4-13-
70.)
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not more than
five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the
entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

estate is a public nuisance because of the presence of a motor vehicle in an
inoperative condition or because such motor vehicle is an unregistered motor
vehicle, evidence that it was viewed on at least five days including the first
day and the eleventh or later day and that at the times of such viewing there
was no visible material change in the vehicle shall constitute a rebuttable
presumption that the motor vehicle was inoperative and/or unregistered for a

Administrator, which service may be by personal service by any officer or
employee of the Village, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by

or parcels of land for a period of more than thirty days unless the
construction or erection plan for the use of said materials has commenced. Such
materials shall be used or consumed in the construction or removed from the
premises when the period of four months from the time said materials are first
placed on the lot, lots, parts of lots, or parcel of land.
   (b)   It shall be unlawful for any person to move any materials so stored or
placed to another location within the Municipality for the purpose of avoiding
the intent of this section, except that any such materials may be moved to
another lot, lots,    parts of lot, or parcels of land when the same have been
sold to a bona fide purchaser for value for such purchaser’s own use.
(Ord. 822. Passed 7-17-06.)

offal to cause it to be removed by persons properly authorized to places
permitted or provided by the Municipality.

person at least three times a year, by May 15, July 1 and again by August 15.

hereby declared to be a public nuisance.
   (b)   Upon information that high weeds and grasses are growing on lands in
the Village, the Village Administrator shall cause written notice to be served
on the owner or person having charge of such lands, which notice shall advise
that such grasses or weeds must be cut within five days after service of such
notice. If the owner or person having charge of the land is a resident, the
notice may be served by any person authorized by the Village Administrator by
personally serving such owner or person having charge of the lands, or by
leaving a copy with a responsible person at the residence, or by posting a copy
in a conspicuous place at the residence. If the owner or person having charge
of such land is a nonresident of the Village, and his address is known, such
notice may be served in the same manner as a resident or may be served by
certified or regular mail. If such person's address is unknown, it shall be
sufficient to publish such notice once in a newspaper of general circulation in
the county or post such notice in a conspicuous place on the land. The Village
Administrator shall determine the particular type of service to be used.
(Ord. 822. Passed 7-17-06.)

seller from exercising reasonable diligence to determine, the following:

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section

or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
(ORC 2909.03)
541.03 CRIMINAL DAMAGING OR ENDANGERING.

to any property of another without the other person’s consent:
      (1)   Knowingly, by any means;
      (2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or
endangering, a misdemeanor of the second degree. If violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an
aircraft and if the violation creates a risk of physical harm to any person or

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)

   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the health, safety, and
general welfare of the citizens of the Village of Edgerton through the
regulation of storm water and non-storm water discharges to the storm drainage
system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law.
This chapter establishes methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants
into the Village Storm Sewer System in order to comply with requirements of the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The
objectives of this chapter are:
   (a)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the Village storm sewer
system by storm water discharges by any user
   (b)   To prohibit Illicit Connections and Discharges to the Village storm
sewer system
   (c)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance
and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.
   (d)   To enact the "Village of Edgerton Storm Water Management Rules and
Regulations" to protect and safeguard the general health, safety and welfare of
the public by abating erosion of the soil and abating the degradation of the
waters of the State by soil sediment in conjunction with non-farm, earth-
disturbing activities.

system discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons,
or to the Village storm sewer system or Waters of the United States. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the
authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to
prevent or minimize damage to the Village storm sewer system or Waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
   (b)   Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to the Village storm sewer system in violation of this ordinance

activity.
   (b)   Access to Facilities.
      (1)   The Village of Edgerton shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this ordinance as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives offo the authorized enforcement
agency.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the Village of Edgerton ready access
to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of
any NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any
additional duties as defined by state and federal law.

permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's storm water discharge.
      (4)   The Village of Edgerton has the right to require the discharger to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Village of Edgerton and shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
operator.
      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Village of Edgerton access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this
ordinance. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized for
required by this ordinance.
      (7)   If the Village of Edgerton has been refused access to any part of
the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a
routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
ordinance or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement
agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent

Storm Water Management Rules and Regulations document shall be applicable to
all subdivision or site plan applications, unless eligible for an exemption or
granted a waiver by the Village of Edgerton as set forth within the document.
(Ord. 863. Passed 5-4-09.)
  
923.15 REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS BY
THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.
   The Owner or Operator will adopt requirements identifying Best Management
Practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or
contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain
system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or
industrial establishment shall provide, at the owner's or operator's own
expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses
through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any
person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source
of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's
expense, additional structural and non-structural BMP's to prevent the further
discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as
necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 863.
Passed 5-4-09.)
923.16 WATERCOURSE PROTECTION.

925.01 AUTHORITY AND TITLE.
   (a)   The Village of Edgerton establishes this set of water quality and
quantity policies applicable to all storm waters to provide reasonable guidance
for the regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of protecting local
water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of storm
water runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction
activities, in order to control and minimize increases in storm water runoff
rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source
pollution associated with storm water runoff, is in the public interest and
will prevent threats to public health and safety.
   (b)   The official title of these rules shall be known as the "Village of
Edgerton Storm Water Management Rules and Regulations." (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-
09.)
925.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Development Area. Means any contiguous (abutting) area owned by one
person or operated as one development unit and used or being developed for non-
farm commercial, industrial, residential or other non-farm purposes upon which
earth-disturbing activities are planned or underway.
   (b)   Drainage Area. Means:
      (1)   The contributing area to a single drainage basin, expressed in

(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.03 PURPOSE.
   The Village of Edgerton has adopted Storm Water Management Rules and
Regulations to establish feasible and economically reasonable standards to
achieve a level of management and conservation practices which will protect and
safeguard the general health, safety and welfare of the public by abating
erosion of the soil and abating the degradation of the waters of the state by
soil sediment in conjunction with non-farm, earth-disturbing activities.
   It is the intent of these rules and regulations to:
   (a)   Minimize increases in storm water runoff from any development in order
to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank
erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels;
   (b)   Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by storm water
runoff from developments which would otherwise degrade local water quality;
   (c)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-
development hydrologic condition to the maximum extent practicable;
   (d)   Reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through storm water management controls
and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose
no threat to public safety;
   (e)   Establish a basis for the design of all storm drainage systems which
will preserve the rights and options of property owners and help assure the
long term adequacy of storm drainage systems. (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.04 APPLICABILITY.
   (a)   These rules and regulations shall be applicable to all subdivision or
site plan applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by
the Village of Edgerton (the Village cannot grant a waiver of the requirements
of the OEPA concerning storm water) of these rules and regulations. These rules
and regulations also apply to land development activities that are smaller than
the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger
common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria,
even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take
place at different times on different schedules to ensure that established
water quality standards will be maintained during and after development of the
site and that post construction runoff levels are consistent with any local and
regional watershed plans. These rules and regulations shall also apply to
modifications on existing Village lots affecting drainage in any way.
   (b)   To prevent the adverse impacts of storm water runoff, the Village of
Edgerton has developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new
development sites. These standards apply to any construction activity
disturbing 5,000 or more square feet of land. This includes all requirements of
the OEPA General Permit (1 acre or more). The following activities may be
exempt from these storm water performance criteria:
      (1)   Any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an
approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan.
      (2)   Additions or modifications to existing single family structures.
      (3)   Developments that do not disturb more than 5,000 square feet of
land, provided they are not part of a larger common development plan;
      (4)   Repairs to any storm water treatment practice deemed necessary by
the Village of Edgerton.
   (c)   The requirements of Section
925.05 must be met prior to an activity being determined exempt by the Village.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.05 REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Any person performing any non-farm, earth-disturbing activity that
disturbs 5,000 square feet or more on five or more contiguous acres of land
owned by one person or operated as one development unit shall be required to
file a Storm Water Management Plan (Refer to Sections
925.21 through
925.27) and obtain a Storm Water Management Permit.
   (b)   Any person performing any non-farm, earth-disturbing activity that
disturbs 5,000 square feet or more on less than five contiguous acres of land
owned by one person or operated as one development unit is required to submit a
Drainage Plan (Refer to Sections
925.28 through
925.33) and obtain a Storm Water Management Permit, and may be required to
submit a Storm Water Management Plan (Refer to Sections
925.21 through
925.27).
   (c)   Any person performing any non-farm, earth-disturbing activity that
disturbs less than 5,000 square feet is required to obtain a Storm Water
Management Permit and submit a Drainage Plan (Refer to Sections
925.28 through
925.33) but is not required to submit a Storm Water Management Plan. However,
all non-farm, earth-disturbing activities are not exempt from compliance with
all other criteria as outlined in this text.
   (d)   In the event that a subdivision/development is constructed in phases,
then the entire subdivision/development size shall determine whether a, b, or c
pertains. All projects of 1 acre or more will also be required to file an OEPA
NOI and prepare a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). (Ord. 864.
Passed 5-4-09.)
925.06 WAIVERS.
   It is conceivable that earth-disturbing activities not automatically subject
to exemptions by Section
925.04 may exist such that the submission of a Storm Water Management or
Drainage Plan serves no real purpose. Such activity shall be eligible for a
waiver from the requirement of submitting a Plan and/or other requirements of
this text.
   To obtain a waiver, the developer shall submit a written request to the
Village of Edgerton. This request shall include sufficient data to determine
that granting a waiver will not result in excessive storm water runoff or rate
of runoff.
   (a)   Waivers for Providing Storm Water Management. Every applicant shall
provide for storm water management as required by these rules and regulations,
unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement. Requests to waive
the storm water management plan requirements shall be submitted to the Village
of Edgerton for approval.
NOTE: No waiver shall be given by the Village of Edgerton when the amount of
disturbed land is over 1 acre. In such case the OEPA rules for an NOI shall
govern.
   The minimum requirements for storm water management may be waived in whole
or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least one of
the following conditions applies:
      (1)   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter.
      (2)   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of storm
water discharges have been established in a storm water management plan that
has been approved by the Village of Edgerton and the implementation of the plan
is required by local ordinance.
      (3)   Provisions are made to manage storm water by an off-site facility.
The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately
sized to provide a level of storm water control that is equal to or greater
than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally
obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the
storm water practice.
      (4)   The Village of Edgerton finds that meeting the minimum on-site
management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
   (b)   Compatibility with Other Permit and Ordinance Requirements. These
rules and regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul
any other rules or regulations, statute, or other provision of law. The
requirements of these rules and regulations should be considered minimum
requirements, and where any provision of these rules and regulations imposes
restrictions different from those imposed by any other rules and regulations,
or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose
higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be
considered to take precedence. OEPA NOI is still required as applicable. (Ord.
864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.07 GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT.
   Unless judged by the Village of Edgerton to be exempt or granted a waiver,
the following performance criteria shall be addressed for storm water
management at all sites:
   (a)   All site designs shall establish storm water management practices to
control the peak flow rates of storm water discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of storm water. These practices should
seek to utilize pervious areas for storm water treatment and to infiltrate
storm water runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, detention
basins and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide
treatment for both water quality and quantity. (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.08 PLAN REVIEW.
   (a)   The Village of Edgerton shall review the Storm Water Management Plan
or Drainage Plan within thirty (30) days of receipt and indicate approval or
disapproval to the person who filed the plan. Indication of disapproval shall
include the plan deficiencies and the procedure for filing a revised plan.
Pending preparation and approval of a revised plan, earth-disturbing activities
shall not be allowed until the deficiencies have been properly addressed. An
approved OEPA Permit will need to be submitted when the amount of earth
disturbed is 1 acre or greater.
   (b)   The Village of Edgerton shall be responsible for review and approval
of all hydrological and runoff calculations, as well as design and construction
inspection for all storm water management facilities. (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-
09.)
925.09 PERMITS.
   (a)   Permit Application Forms will be made available in the Office of the
Village of Edgerton Administrator. Information required will be sufficient for
the Village of Edgerton to determine if a Storm Water Management or Drainage
Plan is necessary and that the developer intends to comply with these
regulations. At a minimum the application shall include the following:
      (1)   Name, address and phone number of property owner or other person
responsible for the activity.
      (2)   Location of the activity.
      (3)   Description of the activity.
         A.   Type of activity

         D.   Size of parcel or lot on which activity will occur
      (4)   If no plan is required, a signed statement that the responsible
person will comply with these rules and regulations.
   (b)   The Village of Edgerton will review the permit application and if no
Storm Water Management Plan or Drainage Plan is required, issue a permit within
thirty (30) working days. Where applicable a SWPPP shall be completed in
accordance with OEPA General Permit.
   (c)   In the event that a plan is required, the permit will be issued upon
approval of detail design, payment of required review and inspection fees, and
posting of required bonds.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.10 FEES.
   (a)   Permit Fees.
      (1)   Permit fees in the amount fixed by resolution of the Village of
Edgerton, Ohio shall be paid to the Village when a permit is issued.
      (2)   No permit fee will be required for the following:
         A.   Non-farm, earth-disturbing activities which have been provided
for in an already approved storm water management plan (i.e. home construction
on a lot in an approved subdivision with an approved Storm Water Management
Plan).
   (b)   Plan Checking and Field Inspection Fees.
      (1)   The person who obtains a Storm Water Management permit upon
approval of a Storm Water Management Plan or Drainage Plan, which involves
design and construction of Storm Water Management Facilities, shall submit
design plans, quantities and itemized cost estimates for the facilities,
prepared by a Professional Registered Engineer to the Village of Edgerton for
review and approval. A certified check in the amount of one hundred dollars
($100.00) plus 0.50% of the construction cost estimate shall be paid to the
Village of Edgerton to offset the cost of plan review. The check shall be made
out to the Village of Edgerton.
      (2)   Plans requiring additional submittal and additional review time
will be charged on an hourly basis over and above the initial fee by the
Village's Engineer hired to review the plans.
      (3)   All field inspection of the construction to assure its conformance
with the plans, shall be charged on an hourly basis and paid to the Village of
Edgerton. If the Storm Water Management Facilities to be constructed are part
of a subdivision being developed then this provision of the Storm Water
Management Regulations shall run in concurrence with them. Fees to be paid by
developer for Village's personnel and/or engineering services as determined on
a case by case basis by Village personnel and/or Village Engineer shall be
placed in an escrow account to be used by the Village prior to any work
commencing. All unused money shall be returned to the developer at the end of
the services performed by Villages Engineer and/or personnel. (Ord. 864. Passed
5-4-09.)
925.11 ASSURANCE OF COMPLETION.
   (a)   The assurance of completion of the storm water drainage facilities and
control structures included in a Storm Water Management Plan or Drainage Plan
which has been developed and approved under these regulations shall be
satisfied by the furnishing of a 100% performance, or surety bond. The Village
shall approve the sufficiency of the bond and the Village Solicitor shall
approve the bond as to form. If it can be shown that assurance of completion is
being provided through another regulation of this Village, this section of the
Storm Water Management Regulations shall be waived.
   (b)   When the development requires water service, water meters shall not be
installed, nor water turned on until all drainage improvements, as approved on

by the Village.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.12 INSPECTION AND COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   The Village Administrator or the Village Administrator's designated
representative shall inspect land disturbance areas to determine that these
rules and regulations are being complied with. If it is determined that a
violation of these rules and regulations exists, the responsible person shall
be notified of the deficiencies or noncompliance by the Village Administrator
or his representative at the site and the deficiency or noncompliance shall be
corrected or construction shall cease until the problem is corrected. If there
is a disagreement by the owner/developer he may appeal to the Council of the
Village of Edgerton. If the Village of Edgerton determines a violation exists,
they shall request the Solicitor of the Village of Edgerton, in writing, to
seek an injunction or other appropriate relief in a court of competent
jurisdiction to secure compliance with these rules and regulations if the
Village's orders are ignored. In granting relief, the court of competent
jurisdiction may order the construction of additional control measures, and may
assess a civil fine of $100 to $500. Each day of violation of a rule or stop
work order issued under this section shall be considered a separation violation
subject to a civil fine.
   (b)   With the submittals and approval of the plans, permission for ingress
and egress is granted to the designated agents or consents of the Village of
Edgerton, the Village's Inspector, for continuous inspection. (Ord. 864. Passed

925.13 STORM WATER AND SEDIMENT COMPLAINT.
   (a)   Upon receipt of a complaint, the Village of Edgerton shall inspect the
site and follow the procedures as outlined in Section
925.12. The Village Administrator shall also file a report and send a copy to
the person filing the complaint on the findings.
   (b)   During the complaint review, the Village may request recommendations
from the Williams County Soil and Water Conservation District, the Edgerton
Planning Commission and the OEPA, and such other persons or agencies as the
Village deems appropriate.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.14 RELATIONSHIP TO SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Many storm water management techniques conflict with traditional urban
subdivision requirements (i.e. storm water can often be better managed in open
grassed waterways while subdivision regulations often require that the water be
collected and carried away in underground pipes).
   (b)   If the Storm Water Management Plan or Drainage Plan developed under
these regulations is in conflict with requirements of the Village of Edgerton
Subdivision Regulations, a variance may be made to the Village of Edgerton
Subdivision Regulations by the Village Planning Commission where it is
determined that such exception will enhance the management of storm water and
not be detrimental to the health, safety and general well being of life and
inhabitants within the Village.
   (c)   A subdivision plat prepared in conjunction with a Storm Water
Management or Drainage Plan, shall include the necessary covenants and
restrictions to assure compliance to these regulations and conformance to the
approved Storm Water Management or Drainage Plan.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.15 SEVERABILITY.
   If any clause, section or provision of these rules and regulations are
declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
validity of the remainder shall not be affected thereby. (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-
09.)
925.16 PURPOSE.
   (a)   Storm Water Management Rules and Regulations have been adopted for the
purpose of regulating non-farm, earth-disturbing activities to control sediment
pollution caused by accelerated soil erosion.
   (b)   Storm water management is premised on the fact that non-farm, earth-
disturbing activities which increase the rate and/or volume of runoff will
increase the rate of erosion and volume of sedimentation. Therefore, earth-
disturbing activities which increase the rate and/or volume of runoff shall be
required to control the discharge rate of runoff prior to its release to off-
site land. The purpose of controlling the release rates is as follows:
      (1)   Permit development without increasing the flooding of the lands.
      (2)   Reduce damage to receiving streams and impairment of their
capacity.
      (3)   Establish a basis for design of a storm water drainage control
system which will preserve the rights and options of both the dominant and
servient property owners.
   (c)   These rules and regulations shall apply to all non-farm, earth-
disturbing activities performed on the lands within the Village of Edgerton;
except those activities as outlined in Section
925.04 of this text. (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.17 CALCULATING STORM WATER RUNOFF.
   The amount of storm water runoff depends on a great number of factors. Some
of these factors are reasonably fixed and subject to accurate determination,
such as watershed size and shape, ground slope and natural ponding. Others are
seasonably variable, such as frozen soil, soil moisture condition, evaporation,
or transpiration. Still others vary by land use, such as type of ground cover
and impervious areas or method of cultivation. Finally, rainfall is extremely
variable as to seasonal conditions and other variable factors. Despite the
indeterminate nature of these factors, methods for obtaining useful information
about storm water runoff have been developed. One of the four methods described
in Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Technical Release Number 55, by the
Soil Conservation Service of the United States Department of Agriculture and
its Ohio Supplement can be used to determine storm water runoff or The Rational
Method, which shall be the minimum design. (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.18 STORM WATER RUNOFF CONTROL CRITERIA.
      Storm water runoff control addresses both peak rate and total volume of
runoff.
   (a)   The storm drainage system installed shall carry a minimum five year 24
hour frequency storm. The design of which shall conform to the Urban Hydrology
for Small Watersheds, Technical Release Number 55, by the Soil Conservation
Service of the United States Department of Agriculture and its Ohio Supplement
or The Rational Method. The retention/detention area shall have a storage
capacity determined with a minimum for a ten year 24 hour frequency storm by
the Critical Storm Method of the Critical Storm Calculation Quick Detention
Sheet, which is available in the office of the Village Administrator.
   (b)   The peak rate of discharge from the retention/detention area shall not
exceed a two year 24 hour frequency storm based on pre-development conditions.
   (c)   Storage volume does not have to be provided for off-site upstream
areas. Flow from such areas will be routed through the drainage system in the
development under consideration at a rate determined in the same manner as the
on-site system. Off-site land uses over the last year before the development
shall be considered as the pre-development condition for the purpose of
calculating changes in runoff.
      (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.19 RUNOFF CONTROL METHODS.
   (a)   The runoff control criteria of this section necessitates the use of
storm water runoff control facilities in many development situations. While the
success of such facilities for accomplishing a desirable level of runoff
control cannot be denied, it is often found these same facilities have the
potential for adding to neighborhood blight or a threat to public health and
safety.
   (b)   Storm water storage facilities can be functional and wholly
unobtrusive. Their presence can offer an added amenity to the urban
environment. This positive impact can be achieved by adherence to four basic
steps in the implementation of storm water runoff control facilities. These
are:
      (1)   Proper selection of runoff control mechanisms.
      (2)   Proper design of facility.
      (3)   Construction of facility in strict adherence to design.
      (4)   Regular maintenance program and designated responsibility for
maintenance.
         (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.20 MAINTENANCE OF STORM WATER DRAINAGE FACILITIES AND CONTROL STRUCTURES.
   When storm water drainage facilities and control structures that benefit
more than one property owner are of a permanent nature and located in Village
right-of-way, the Village will assume responsibility for said structures once
they have been constructed and are functioning according to approved plans. In
the case of storm water drainage facilities and control structures (retention
ponds and other waterways) not located in Village right-of-way, the homeowners
and/or Home Association will assume responsibility for said structures and
shall be responsible for all mowing and maintenance required. Ownership and/or
easement for the purpose of maintenance shall be granted to the Village for
access to all structures and facilities for which the Village is assuming
permanent maintenance responsibility.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.21 PREPARING A STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   A Storm Water Management Plan is required on all developments. The plan
development process is one which provokes thought and consideration of
management alternative relative to storm water early in the overall site
development process.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.22 DATA COLLECTION.
   Inventory the existing site conditions to gather information which will help
develop the most effective storm water management plan. The information
obtained should be plotted on a map and included with the calculations portion
of the plan.
   (a)   Topography. A 200-scale topographic map of the site should be prepared
to show the existing elevations at two foot (2') intervals or other intervals
as deemed necessary by the Village of Edgerton. When drainage areas are large
and cover areas off-site, USGS maps may be used to show these off-site drainage
areas.
   (b)   Drainage Patterns. All existing drainage swales and patterns should be
located and clearly marked on the topographic map.
   (c)   Soils. Major soil type(s) on the site should be determined and shown
on the topographic map. Soil information can be obtained from the Williams
County Soil Survey of the Village of Edgerton. Soil information should be
plotted directly onto the map or an overlay of the same scale for ease of
interpretation.
    (d)   Ground Cover. The existing vegetation on the site should be shown on
the topographic map. Such features as tree clusters, grassy areas and unique
vegetation should be located on the map. In addition, existing denuded or
exposed soil areas should be indicated on the map. (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.23 RUNOFF CALCULATIONS BEFORE DEVELOPMENT.
   With the completion of the Data Collection activity the peak rate of runoff
and runoff volume for the pre-development situation can be determined for the
two (2) year storm.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.24 DATA ANALYSIS.
   When all of the data collected has been considered together, a picture of
the site potential and limitations should begin to emerge. The areas of the
site which have potentially critical drainage hazards should be determined. The
following are some important points to consider in site analysis.
   (a)   Topography. The primary topographic considerations are slope steepness
and slope length. Because of the adverse effect of long and steep slope on
runoff, special care should be used in these potentially critical areas.
   (b)   Natural Drainage. Natural drainage patterns exist on the land and
should be identified on the plan so they can be incorporated into the proposed
drainage system. Where it is possible, natural drainage ways should be used to
convey the runoff to avoid the expense and problems of constructing artificial
drainage systems. Care should also be taken to be sure that the existing
natural drainage system is not overloaded.
   (c)   Soils. The major soil consideration from a runoff control standpoint
is rate of infiltration of rainwater. Soils of the Village have been grouped
into hydrologic soil classes, which can be used to help determine the areas
where critical runoff will occur.
   (d)   Ground Cover. The type of existing ground cover greatly affects the
amount of existing runoff from any given area. By knowing the types of existing
ground cover and the proposed types, critical areas of runoff can be
determined.
      (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.25 DRAINAGE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT.
   After analyzing the data and determining the site limitations, the Engineer
can then develop a drainage system. The engineer should work with the site
planner and attempt to locate the buildings, roads and parking lots to exploit
the strengths of the site and overcome the drainage limitations of the site.
The following are some points to consider in making these decisions:
   (a)   Fit Drainage Systems to Terrain. The Engineer should attempt to tailor
the drainage system to the existing site conditions. This will avoid
unnecessary land disturbance and therefore help reduce the increase in runoff.
   (b)   Confine Construction to Areas Not in Drainageways. Any land
disturbance in drainageways will necessitate the installation of more costly
control measures.
   (c)   Cluster Building Sites Together. Clustering building sites together
outside of natural drainageways minimizes the amount of disturbed cover and
helps reduce the increase in runoff.
   (d)   Minimize Impervious Areas. Keep paved areas such as parking lots and
roads to a minimum. The more land that is kept in vegetative cover, the more
water will have a chance to infiltrate, thus minimizing runoff.
      (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.26 PLAN FOR RUNOFF CONTROL.
   When the general layout of the site has been decided upon, a plan to control
runoff from the site must be formulated.
   (a)   Divide the Site Into Drainage Areas. Determine how much and where the
runoff will travel over the site. Consider how runoff can be controlled in each
drainage area. In most cases it is easier to control runoff in smaller areas
than to try to handle the entire site at some location downstream as it leaves
the site.
   (b)   Select Runoff Control Practices. Runoff control practices can be
divided into three broad categories:
      (1)   Vegetative Controls.
      (2)   Structural Controls.
      (3)   Management Measures.
   Local or State handbooks should be used to select and design appropriate
vegetative and structural practices. Management measures are common sense types
of controls used to help minimize the need for physical practices.
      (1)   Vegetative Controls. Keep in mind that the first line of defense is
to prevent increase in volume or rate of runoff. This is accomplished by
protecting the soil surface as much as possible and not decreasing the over-
land flow time.
      (2)   Structural Controls. Where large increases in runoff occur,
structural practices are generally the only way to control runoff. It is very
important the structural practices be selected, designed and constructed
according to standards and specifications of the engineer of jurisdiction.
Improper use of inadequate installation can create problems which are greater
than the structure was designed to solve.
      (3)   Management Measures. Good site design and construction management
is as important as any physical practices used for runoff control. The
following are only some management considerations:
         A.   Design site to help reduce runoff in open areas and not increase
it.
         B.   Use stage construction.
         C.   Use as few pipe systems as possible.
         D.   Allow runoff to travel around within the site and not just
straight through. (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.27 DEVELOP DESIGN DETAILS.
   Once a development plan and drainage system that meets the runoff criteria
has been decided upon, the detailed plans for the drainage facilities and
control structures should be developed. Detailed design plans shall be
developed according to generally accepted engineering principles and approved
by the Village. (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.28 PREPARING A DRAINAGE PLAN.
   Smaller site developments can result in major increases in runoff, but the
alternatives for handling them are usually limited. Wherever possible, the
developer is encouraged to go through all of the steps under Section
925.21 to
925.27. However, in the situation where there is only one alternative for
surface development on a small site and it is merely a matter of designing a
drainage system to meet the runoff criteria, the developer shall submit
sufficient information to show that the criteria is being met and that the
drainage facilities and control structures have been designed to standard.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.29  DATA COLLECTION.
   In order to analyze the before development condition, the same data that is
required for a management plan is required for a drainage plan. Follow Section
925.22.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.30 RUNOFF CALCULATIONS BEFORE DEVELOPMENT.
   With the completion of the Data Collection activity, the peak rate of runoff
and runoff volume for the pre-development situation can be determined for the
two (2) year storm.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.31 RUNOFF CALCULATION AND CONTROL CRITERIA (CRITICAL STORM METHOD).
   (a)   The critical storm method shall be used in determining the magnitude
of runoff control.
   (b)   In most cases for small sites, the developer will know how the surface
of the site is to be developed. He can then go directly to calculation of
increase of runoff and determination of runoff criteria following the steps in
Section
925.26.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.32 PLAN FOR RUNOFF CONTROL.
   From the results of Section
925.31, the developer can determine the type and magnitude of control practices
the developer will need, in most cases being some type of structural control.
These controls should be located on the site plan and runoff calculations
checked.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.33 DEVELOP DESIGN DETAILS.
   Once a development plan and drainage plan and drainage system that meets the
runoff criteria have been decided upon, then detailed design plans for the
drainage facilities and structures should be developed. It is important at this
point to work closely with the Village's engineer or Village personnel to make
sure that all facilities and structures are being designed according to any
standards and criteria that may exist for these types of structures within the
jurisdiction.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.34 SUBMISSION OF A DRAINAGE PLAN.
   (a)   The plan submission shall consist of three parts:
      (1)   Site Plan.
      (2)   Engineering details.
      (3)   SWPPP (OEPA Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan).
   (b)   The site plan is a series of maps pictorially explaining the
information in the narrative. The engineering details are detailed drawings,
calculations and specifications on the drainage facilities and control
structures to be constructed as part of the development.
(Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.35 EROSION PLAN DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA.
   Effective erosion control planning requires a working knowledge of both the
application of control measures in terms of their selection and location and
the design of the control measure in terms of their selection and location and
the design of the control measure in terms of its configuration, size and
construction. Of utmost importance, however, is a familiarity with the basic
criteria that should guide the preparation of all erosion control plans
regardless of their scale or complexity. These criteria are as follows:
   (a)   Stabilization of Denuded Areas and Soil Stockpiles.
      (1)   Permanent or temporary soil stabilization should be applied to
denuded areas after final grade is reached on any portion of the site. Soil
stabilization should also be applied to denuded areas which may not be at final
grade, but will remain undisturbed during the construction period.
      (2)   Soil stabilization refers to measures which protect soil from the
erosive forces of raindrop impact and flowing water. Applicable practices
include vegetative establishment, mulching and the early application of gravel
base on areas to be paved. Soil stabilization measures should be selected to be
appropriate for the time of year, site conditions and estimated duration of
use.
      (3)   Soil stockpiles should be stabilized or protected with sediment
trapping measures to prevent soil loss.
   (b)   Establishment of Permanent Vegetation. A permanent vegetative cover
should be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation should not be considered established until a ground cover
is achieved which is mature enough to control soil erosion satisfactorily and
to survive severe weather conditions.
   (c)   Protection of Adjacent Properties.
      (1)   Properties adjacent to the site of a land disturbance should be
protected from sediment deposition. This may be accomplished by preserving a
well vegetated buffer strip around the lower perimeter of the land disturbance,
by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers, filters or dikes,
or sediment basins, or by a combination of such measures.
      (2)   Vegetated filter strips may be used only where sheet flow runoff is
expected. In general, filter strips should be at least fifteen feet (15') in
width. If at any time it is found that a vegetated filter strip is ineffective
in stopping sediment movement into adjacent property, additional perimeter
controls should be provided.
   (d)   Timing and Stabilization of Sediment Trapping Measures. Sediment
basins, diversions, sediment barriers and other measures intended to trap
sediment on-site should be constructed as a first step in grading and be made
functional before upslope land disturbance takes place. Earthen structures such
as dams, dikes and diversions should be seeded and mulched after installation.
   (e)   Sediment Basins. Storm water runoff containing damaging amounts of
sediment should pass through a sediment basin or other suitable sediment
trapping facility.
   (f)   Cut and Fill Slopes. Cut and fill slopes should be designed and
constructed in a manner which will minimize erosion. Consideration should be
given to the length and steepness of the slope, the soil type, upslope drainage
area, groundwater conditions and other applicable factors. Slopes which are
found to be eroding excessively within one year of construction should be
provided with additional slope stabilizing measures until the problem is
corrected.
   (g)   Stabilization of Waterways and Outlets. All on-site storm water
surface channels should be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from a ten-year frequency storm without erosion. Design for a
larger frequency storm may be necessary for protection from the storm water
flow. Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion should also be provided at the
outlets of all pipes and paved channels.
   (h)   Storm Sewer Inlet Protection. All storm sewer inlets which are made
operable during construction should be protected so that sediment-laden water
will not enter the conveyance system without first being filtered or otherwise
treated to remove sediment.
   (i)   Working In or Crossing Watercourses. Construction vehicles should be
kept out of watercourses to the extent possible. Where in-channel work is
necessary, precautions should be taken to stabilize the work area during
construction to minimize erosion. The channel (including bed and banks) should
always be re-established immediately after in-channel work is completed. Where
a live watercourse must be crossed by construction vehicles regularly during
construction, a temporary stream crossing should be provided.
    (j)   Construction Access Routes. Wherever construction vehicle access
routes intersect paved public roads, provisions should be made to minimize the
transport of sediment (mud) by runoff or vehicle tracking onto the paved
surface.
   (k)   Disposition of Temporary Measures. All temporary erosion and sediment
control measures should be disposed of after final site stabilization is
achieved or after the temporary measures are no longer needed. Trapped sediment
and other disturbed soil areas resulting from the disposition of temporary
measures should be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and
sedimentation.
   (l)   Maintenance. All temporary and permanent erosion and sediment control
measures shall be maintained and repaired as needed to assure continued
performance of their intended function. Inspection by Village of Edgerton
Administrator or his appointed inspector shall determine if and when
maintenance/repair is needed.
   (m)   Plans and Specifications. All erosion control practices contained on
the plan shall be built to the standards and specifications of the "Water
Management and Sediment Control for Urbanizing Areas" handbook.
   (n)   OEPA SWPPP. A Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan must be prepared
in accordance with the OEPA General Permit. A Notice of Intent must be
submitted to the OEPA 45 days prior to beginning work.
      The SWPPP must be submitted to the Village for approval.
      (Ord. 864. Passed 5-4-09.)
925.36 STORM SEWER RATES.
   Effective for bills rendered on or about January 1, 2021, each utility
customer located within the Village corporate limits shall be charged the
following Storm Sewer rates:
 
      Residential - $5.00 per month
      Commercial - $7.50 per month
      Large Power - $15.00 per month

929.01 DRILLING OF WATER WELLS AND VERTICAL BORE HOLES.
   (a)   For the quantitative and qualitative protection of the water supply of
the Village, to prevent waste of water and the pollution thereof, to protect
the integrity of the waste water treatment system, and to protect the surface
drainage system, the drilling of water wells and vertical bore holes within the
Village are prohibited except under the following conditions:
      (1)   For residential household use where the Village is not able to
supply water by extension of Village water mains;
      (2)   Where water is used for horizontal loop geothermal heating or
cooling purposes. No injection or reinjection is permitted. Vertical close loop
geothermal is prohibited within the Village and areas under control of the
Wellhead Protection Ordinance.
      (3)   No water drawn from such a well shall be consumed or used for any
other purpose. Such water shall be discharged into a surface drainage storm
sewer in an uncontaminated condition.
         (Ord. 866. Passed 7-6-09.)
   (b)   Notice of the intention to drill any water well shall be given to the
Village Administrator not less than ten working days before work is to commence
on the making of said well. This notice shall include at least the name,
address and telephone number of the owner of the land upon which the well is to
be drilled, the date the drilling is to commence, the location of the well, the
size of the well, the purposes for the well, and the name of the driller.
   (c)   Whoever violates the provisions of this section shall be fined not
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each offense. For purposes of this
section, failure to give the notice required by subsection (b) hereof in a
timely manner and/or the commencement of the drilling of a water well without
complying with the notice provisions shall be considered to be separate
offenses; further, each day work continues on a well the construction of which
was begun without appropriate notice having been given and/or each day water is
drawn or forced from the earth and not returned in accordance with the
provisions of this section shall constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. 429. Passed 4-26-82.)
929.02 BACKFLOW PROTECTION.
   (a)   If, in the judgment of the Superintendent of Water, an approved
backflow prevention device is necessary for the safety of the public water
system, the Superintendent of Water will give notice to the water consumer to
install such an approved device immediately. The water consumer shall, at his
own expense, install such an approved device at a location and in a manner
approved by the Superintendent of Water and shall have inspections and tests
made of such approved devices as required by the Superintendent of Water.
   (b)   No person, firm or corporation shall establish or permit to be
established, or maintain or permit to be maintained any connection whereby a
private, auxiliary or emergency water supply other than the regular public
water supply of the Village of Edgerton may enter the supply or distributing
system of the Municipality, unless such private, auxiliary or emergency water
supply and method of connection and use of such supply shall have been approved
by the Superintendent of Water and by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   (c)   It shall be the duty of the Superintendent of Water to cause surveys
and investigations to be made of industrial and other properties served by the
public water supply where actual or potential hazards to the public water
supply may exist. Such surveys and investigations shall be made a matter of
public record and shall be repeated as often as the Superintendent of Water
shall deem necessary.
   (d)   The Superintendent of Water or his or its duly authorized
representative shall have the right to enter at any reasonable time any
property served by a connection to the public water supply or distribution
system of the Village for the purpose of inspecting the piping system or
systems thereof. On demand the owner, lessees or occupants of any property so
served shall furnish to the Superintendent of Water any information which he
may request regarding the piping system or systems or water use on such
property. The refusal of such information, when demanded, shall, within the
discretion of the Superintendent of Water, be deemed evidence of the presence
of improper connections as provided in this section.
   (e)   The Superintendent of Water is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service
to any property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this
section is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as he
may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the public water
supply distribution mains. Water service to such property shall not be restored
until such conditions shall have been eliminated or corrected in compliance
with the provisions of this section.
929.03 RESIDENTIAL WATER SERVICE.
   (a)   Availability. The Residential Rate is available for domestic water
service to individual residences and multiple dwelling units such as
apartments, trailers, etc., used for strictly residential purposes. Where
service is supplied for commercial, business, professional or for other similar
nonresidential purposes, such service shall be considered Commercial in
character and the applicable Commercial Schedule shall apply.

1129.01 COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The regulations set forth by the Zoning Ordinance within each district
shall be minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of
structure or land except as hereinafter provided.
   (b)   No building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied and
no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered unless in conformity
with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is
located.
   (c)   No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered:
      (1)   To exceed the height;
      (2)   To accommodate or house a greater number of families;
      (3)   To occupy a grater percentage of lot area;
      (4)   To have narrower or smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards or

than herein required; or in any other manner contrary to the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)   No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of the Zoning Ordinance
shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth
herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance
shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by the Zoning
Ordinance.
   (e)   Variances to these regulations in specific cases may be authorized by
the Planning Commission where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary
hardships in carrying out the strict letter of the Zoning Ordinance providing
such exception is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Zoning
Ordinance and in accordance with the procedures and provisions of same.
Hardship shall be based on physical limitations of the land and does not
encompass financial considerations. Variances shall only be granted in
accordance with the standards and procedures established in Section
1145.05. (Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)
1129.02 INTERPRETATION, PURPOSE AND CONFLICT.
   In interpreting and applying the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, they
shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public
safety, health, convenience, comfort, morals, prosperity and general welfare.
It is not intended by the Zoning Ordinance to interfere or abrogate or annul
any resolution, rule, regulation or permit previously adopted or issued, and
not in conflict with any of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, or which
shall be adopted or issued, pursuant to law relating to the use of buildings or
premises and likewise not in conflict with the Zoning Ordinance; nor is it
intended by the Zoning Ordinance to interfere with or abrogate or annul any
easements, covenants, or other agreements between parties; provided, however,
that where the Zoning Ordinance imposes a greater restriction upon the use of
buildings or premises or upon the height of buildings, or requires larger open
spaces or larger lot areas than are imposed or required by such other
resolutions or agreements, the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance shall
control. (Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)
1129.03 NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES OR USES.
   (a)   Non-conforming Structure.
      (1)   Maintenance permitted. A non-conforming structure lawfully existing
upon the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance may be maintained, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
      (2)   Repairs. A non-conforming structure may be repaired or altered
provided no structural change shall be made.
      (3)   Additions, enlargements or moving.
         A.   A structure non-conforming as to use, height, yard requirements
or lot area per dwelling unit shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner
unless such structure, including such addition or enlargement, is made to
conform to the use, height, yard and area requirements of the district in which
it is located.
         B.   No non-conforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part to
any other location on the lot on which it is located unless every portion of
such structure is made to conform to all the requirements of the district in
which it is located.
   (b)   Non-conforming Uses.
      (1)   Continuation and change of use. Except as otherwise provided in the
Zoning Ordinance:
         A.   A non-conforming use lawfully existing upon the effective date of
the Zoning Ordinance may be continued.
         B.   A non-conforming use may be changed only to a use of the same or
more restricted classification.
      (2)   Expansion Prohibited.
         A.   A non-conforming use in a structure designed for a conforming use
shall not be expanded or extended into any other portion of such conforming
structure nor changed except to a conforming use.
         B.   A non-conforming use on a part of a lot shall not be expanded or
extended into any other portion of such lot.
   (c)   Single Non-Conforming Lots of Record. In any district in which single-
family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of the Zoning Ordinance notwithstanding
limitations imposed by other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. Such lot must
be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the
same ownership. This provision shall apply for area or width, or both, that are
generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and
requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot
shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
Variances of requirements of this Zoning Ordinance other than lot area or lot
width shall be obtained only through action of the Planning Commission
according to the procedures and requirements of Section
1145.05.
   (d)   Non-Conforming Lots of Record in Combination. If two or more lots or a
combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of the Zoning
Ordinance and if all or part of the lots with no buildings do not meet the
requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of the Zoning Ordinance
and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which
diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by the
Zoning Ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a
lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)   Non-Conforming Variance Permitted by Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission according to the procedures and requirements of Section
1145.05 may authorize upon appeals in specific cases such variance from the
terms of this section as will not be contrary to the public interest, where,
owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this
section will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this
section shall be observed and substantial justice done; provided, however, that
no action shall be taken or decision made except after public hearing.
   (f)   Any building arranged, intended or designed for a non-conforming use
the construction of which has been started at the time of the passage of the
Zoning Ordinance, but not completed, may be completed and put into such non-
conforming use, provided it is done within one year after the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance.
   (g)   Discontinuance.
      (1)   Whenever a non-conforming use has been discontinued for a period of
two years such use shall not thereafter be re-established or used except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located.
      (2)   A non-conforming use which has been damaged by fire, explosion, act
of God or the public enemy to the extent of sixty percent (60%) or more of its
reproduction value at the time of damage shall not be restored except in
conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. When
damaged by less than sixty percent (60%) of its reproduction value, a non-
conforming use may be repaired or reconstructed, and used as before the time of
damage, provided such repairs or reconstruction are started within one year of
the date of such damage.
      (3)   Any mobile home which is located within the corporate limits of the
Village on the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance shall be considered as a
non- conforming use unless the mobile home is in a licensed mobile home court.
In the event a non-conforming mobile home is removed from a parcel of land,
another mobile home shall not replace it unless one of the following occurs:
(Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)
         A.   The replacement occurred within 120 days after the original
mobile home was removed. (Ord. 427. Passed 6-28-82.)
         B.   A conditional use has been granted for the mobile home by the
Planning Commission. (Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)

   (c)   Mixed Uses. In the case of mixed uses in the same building or
structure the total requirement for off-street parking facilities shall be the
sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately on the basis of
the items set out in this section and off-street parking facilities for one use
shall not be considered as providing required parking facilities for any other
use except as hereinafter specified in subsection (d) hereof.
   (d)   Collective Parking Facilities. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to prevent collective provision for any off-street parking facilities
for two or more buildings or uses; provided however, that the total number of
off-street parking spaces shall not be less than the sum of the requirements
for the various individual uses involved computed separately on the basis of
the items set out in this section.
   (e)   Where Provided. All parking spaces provided pursuant to this section
shall be on the same lot with the building or use for which such spaces are
required, except that the Board, after public hearing, may permit the parking
spaces to be on any lot within 300 feet of the building; provided, however,
that if the Board determines, after public hearing, that it is impractical to
provide parking spaces on the same lot with the building or use for which such
spaces are required, or within 300 feet thereof, the Board may permit the
parking spaces to be on a lot greater distance than 300 feet from such building
or use, subject to appropriate conditions imposed by the Board regarding such
building or use, subject to appropriate conditions imposed by the Board
regarding such location, character or other features of the proposed lot for
parking spaces as are reasonably required for the purposes of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (f)   Distance Measurements. The distance to any parking space area as
herein required shall be measured between the nearest point of the off-street
parking facility and the nearest point of the building said parking facility is
to serve.

Provided, however, that in no case shall the required off- street loading space
be part of the area used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance. (Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)

1137.01 DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
   The Village is hereby divided into districts under four general categories
which shall be known as: Open Area Districts, Residential Districts, Business
Districts and Industrial Districts.
   (a)   Open Area Districts.
"S-1" Special: Areas which are suitable for parks and recreation, public uses,
and essential services.
   (b)   Residential Districts.
(1)   "R-1" Low Density Residence: For relatively low density residential
development which may or may not have group water and sewage facilities.
      (2)   "R-2" Moderate Density Residence: For residential development of
moderate density, including multiple dwellings as well as one and two- family
residences served by or proposed to be served by group water and sewerage
facilities. (Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)
      (3)   "R-3" Heavy Density Residence: For residential development of
moderate density, including multiple dwellings as well as one and two-family
residences served by or proposed to be served by group water and sewerage
facilities on certain lots of the original plat of the Village.
         (Ord. 427. Passed 6-28-82.)
   (c)   Business Districts.
      (1)   "C-1" Downtown Business: For the central business area of the
Village in recognition of the traditional development pattern of common walls,
development to the property lines and no on-site parking.
         (Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)
      (2)   "C-2" General Business: Those areas outside the traditional central
commercial area of the Village along major highways or thoroughfares.
         (Ord. 381. Passed 2-25-80.)
   (d)   Industrial Districts.
      (1)   "M-1" Light Manufacturing District (M-1): The purpose of the M-
1 District is to encourage the development of manufacturing and wholesale
business establishments which are clean, quiet, and free of hazardous or
objectionable elements such as noise, odor, dust, smoke, or glare; operate
entirely within enclosed structures and generate little industrial traffic.
Research activities are encouraged. This district is further designed to act as
a transitional use between heavy manufacturing uses and other less intense
business and residential uses.
      (2)   "M-2" Heavy Manufacturing District (M-2): The purpose of the M-
2 District is to provide land for the mining, processing, and storage of
mineral resources. This district is designed to assure that these resources be
properly managed and all lands be reclaimed so as not to create a hazard or
nuisance which either immediately or in the future adversely affects the
health, safety, or general welfare of the community.
         (Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)
1137.02 DISTRICT MAP.
   (a)   The boundaries of the districts are shown upon the map which is made a
part of this Zoning Ordinance which map is designated as the "District Map".
The district map and other information shown thereon are a part of this Zoning
Ordinance. The district map is properly attested and is on file with the
Village Clerk.
   (b)   No changes of any nature shall be made in the District Map or matter
shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this Zoning
Ordinance. The Village Clerk shall maintain said map and make the appropriate
changes thereto as enacted by the Council.
   (c)   The District Map, which shall be located in the Office of the Village
Clerk shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land and
water area, buildings and other structures. (Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)
1137.03 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   The district boundary lines on said map are intended to follow either
centerlines of thoroughfares or railroads or lot lines. In the case of
unsubdivided property, the district boundary lines shall be determined by the
use of the scale appearing on the District Map or by dimensions.
(Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)

the conduct of its affairs in keeping with the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance. Meetings shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other

(Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)
1145.03 COMBINING FUNCTIONS OF PLANNING COMMISSION AND BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   (a) Combined Boards.  In accordance with Ohio R.C. 713.11, all
administrative powers and functions of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
delegated to the Village Planning Commission. The existing Board of Zoning
Appeals is hereby abolished. Any powers or responsibilities previously
conferred upon the Board of Zoning Appeals by applicable rules or legislation
are hereby conferred upon the Village Planning Commission, including those
powers and responsibilities set forth in Chapter
1145 of the Village municipal code. Any Village legislation that refers to the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall hereafter be deemed to refer to the Village
Planning Commission.
   (b) Proceedings. The Commission shall adopt rules necessary to the conduct
of its affairs in keeping with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
Meetings shall be held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as
the Commission may determine. The chairman, or in chairman's absence the acting
chairman, may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses. All
meetings shall be open to the public. The Commission shall keep minutes of its
proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or if absent
or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be a public record
and be immediately filed in the office of the Commission.
   (c) Duties. In exercising its duties, the Commission may, as long as such
action is in conformity with the terms of this Zoning Ordinance, reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or modify the order, requirement, decision, or
determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or
determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have the powers of the
Zoning Inspector from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four
members of the Commission shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement,
decision, or determination of the Zoning Inspector, or to decide in favor of
the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under this Zoning
Ordinance or to effect any variation in the application of this Zoning
Ordinance. For the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance the Board has the
following specific responsibilities:
      (1)    To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is an error
in any order, requirement, decision, interpretation, or determination made by
the Zoning Inspector;
      (2)    To authorize such variances from the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, when, owing to the
special conditions, a literal enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance will result
in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this Zoning Ordinance shall
be observed and substantial justice done;
      (3)    To grant conditional use permits as specified in this Zoning
Ordinance under the conditions specified in this Zoning Ordinance and such
additional safeguards as will uphold the intent of this Zoning Ordinance.
         (Ord. 955. Passed 2-2-15.)
1145.04 APPEAL PROCEDURE GENERALLY.
   (a)   It is the intent of this Zoning Ordinance that all questions of
interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to the Zoning
Inspector, and that such questions shall be presented to the Planning
Commission only on appeal from the decision of the Zoning Inspector, and that
recourse from the decisions of the Planning Commission shall be to the courts
as provided by law.
   (b)   It is further the intent of this Zoning Ordinance that the duties of
Council in connection with this Zoning Ordinance shall not include hearing and
deciding questions of interpretation and enforcement that may arise. The
procedure for deciding such questions shall be as stated in this chapter and
this Zoning Ordinance. Under this Zoning Ordinance Council shall have only the
duties of considering and adopting or rejecting proposed amendments or the
repeal of this Ordinance as provided by law, and of establishing a schedule of
fees and charges as stated in Section
1141.02. Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall be interpreted to prevent any
official of the Village from appealing a decision of the Planning Commission to
the Courts as provided in Ohio R. C. Chapters 2505 and 2506. Any such appeal
shall be made within ten days of the Planning Commission’s written decision.
(Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)
1145.05 PROCEDURE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals and variances shall conform to the procedures and requirements
of subsection (b) through (j), inclusive. As specified in this Chapter
1145, the Planning Commission has appellate jurisdiction relative to appeals
and variances.
   (b)   Appeals. Appeal to the Planning Commission concerning interpretation
or administration of this Zoning Ordinance may be taken by any person aggrieved
or by any officer or bureau of the legislative authority of the Village
affected by any decision on the Zoning Inspector. Such appeal shall be taken
within twenty days after the decision by filing, with the Zoning Inspector and
with the Planning Commission, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds upon
which the appeal is being taken. The Zoning Inspector shall transmit to the
Planning Commission all the papers constituting the record upon which the
action appealed from was taken.
   (c)   Stay of Proceedings. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Inspector from whom the appeal is
taken certifies to the Planning Commission after the notice of appeal is filed
with him, that by reason of facts stated in the application, a stay would, in
his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case,
proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be
granted by the Planning Commission or by a court of record on application, on
notice to the Zoning Inspector from whom the appeal is taken on due cause
shown.
   (d)   Variances. The Planning Commission may authorize upon appeal in
specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be
contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal
enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance would result in
unnecessary hardship. No non-conforming use of neighboring lands, structures,
or buildings in the same district and not permitted or non-conforming use of
lands, structures, or buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds
for issuance of a variance. Variances shall not be granted on the grounds of
convenience or profit, but only where strict application of the provisions of
this Zoning Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (e)   Application and Standards of Variances. A variance from the terms of
this Zoning Ordinance shall not be granted by the Planning Commission unless
and until a written application for a variance is submitted to the Zoning
Inspector and the Planning Commission containing:
      (1)   Name, address and phone number of applicants;
      (2)   Legal description of property;
      (3)   Description of nature of variance requested;
      (4)   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to the following standards:
         A.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures or buildings in the same district;
         B.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same district under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance;
         C.   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant;
         D.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Zoning Ordinance to
other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
   A variance shall not be granted unless the Board makes specific findings of
fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to it, which support
conclusions that the standards and conditions imposed by subsection (e)(4)
hereof have been met by the applicant.
   (f)   Supplementary Conditions and Safeguards. Under no circumstances shall
the Planning Commission grant an appeal or variance to allow a use not
permissible under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance in the district involved,
or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance in said district. In granting any appeal or variance, the Planning
Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity
with this Zoning Ordinance. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when
made a part of the terms under which the appeal or variance is granted, shall
be deemed a violation of this Zoning Ordinance and punishable under Section
 1141.99. (Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)
   (g)   Public Hearing by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission
shall hold a public hearing within sixty days after the receipt of an
application for an appeal or variance from the Zoning Inspector or an
applicant. (Ord. 346. Passed 11-13-78.)
   (h)   Notice of Public Hearing in Newspaper. Before holding the public
hearing required in subsection (f), notice of such hearing shall be given in
one or more newspapers of general circulation in the Village at least ten days
before the date of said hearing. The notice shall set forth the time and place
of the public hearing, and the nature of the proposed appeal or variance.
   (i)   Notice to Parties in Interest. Before holding the public hearing
required in subsection (f), written notice of such hearing shall be mailed by
the Chairman of the Planning Commision, by first class mail, at least ten days
before the day of the hearing to all parties in interest. The notice shall
contain the same information as required of notices published in newspapers as
specified in subsection (h) above.
   (j)   Action by Planning Commission. Within thirty days after the public
hearing required in subsection (f), the Planning Commission shall either
approve, approve with supplementary conditions as specified in subsection (f),
or disapprove the request for appeal or variance. The Planning Commission shall
further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify
the granting of the variance that will make possible a reasonable use of the
land, building, or structure. Appeals from Board decisions shall be made in the
manner specified in Section
1145.04. (Ord. 312. Passed 9-26-77.)
1145.06 PROCEDURE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   Conditional uses shall conform to the procedures and requirements set forth
in the following subsections.
   (a)   General. It is recognized that an increasing number of new kinds of
uses are appearing daily, and that many of these and some other more
conventional uses possess characteristics of such unique and special nature
relative to location, design, size, method of operation, circulation, and
public facilities that each specific use must be considered individually. These
specific uses as they are conditionally permitted under the provisions of
Section
1137.04, shall follow the procedures and requirements set forth in subsections
(b) through (i).
   (b)   Contents of Application for Conditional Use Permit. An application for
conditional use permit shall be filed with the Chairman of the Planning
Commission by at least one owner or lessee of property for which such
conditional use is proposed. At a minimum, the application shall contain the
following information:
      (1)   Name, address and phone number of applicant;
      (2)   Legal description of property;
      (3)   Description of existing use;
      (4)   Zoning district;
      (5)   Description of proposed conditional use;
      (6)   A plan of the proposed site for the conditional use showing the
location of all buildings, parking and loading area, traffic access and traffic
circulation, open spaces, landscaping, refuse and service area, utilities,
signs, yards, and such other information as the Board may require to determine
if the proposed conditional use meets the intent and requirements of this
Zoning Ordinance.
      (7)   A narrative statement evaluating the effects on adjoining property;
the effect of such elements as noise, glare, odor, fumes and vibration on
adjoining property; a discussion of the general compatibility with adjacent and
other properties in the district; and the relationship of the proposed use to
the comprehensive plan;
      (8)   Such other information as may be required in subsection (d).
   (c)   General Standards Applicable to All Conditional Uses. In addition to
the specific requirements for conditionally permitted uses as specified in
subsection (d), the Planning Commission shall review the particular facts and
circumstances of each proposed use in terms of the following standards and
shall find adequate evidence showing that such use at the proposed location:
      (1)   Is in fact a conditional use as established under the provisions of
Section
1137.04;
      (2)   Will be harmonious with and in accordance with the general
objectives, or with any specific objective of the Village's comprehensive plan
and/or the Zoning Ordinance;
      (3)   Will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area;
      (4)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses;
      (5)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that the persons
or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able
to provide adequately any such services;
      (6)   Will not create excessive additional requirements at public cost
for public facilities and services and will not be detrimental to the economic
welfare of the community;
      (7)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment
and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,
smoke, fumes, glare or odors;
      (8)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which will be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares;
      (9)   Will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage of a natural,
scenic, or historic feature of major importance.
   (d)   Specific Criteria for Conditional Uses. Following is a list of
specific requirements for conditionally permitted uses.
      (1)   All structures and activity areas should be located at least 100
feet from all property lines;
      (2)    Loud speakers which cause a hazard or annoyance shall not be

1301.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety and general welfare of its citizens.
(Ord. 861. Passed 3-2-09.)
1301.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village of Edgerton has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of
such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these
regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 861. Passed 3-2-09.)
1301.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)    Protect human life and health;
   (b)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)    Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)    Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)    Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)    Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program. (Ord. 861. Passed 3-2-09.)
1301.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazard, or which result in damaging increases
in flood heights or velocities;
   (b)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)    Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage;
   (e)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
      (Ord. 861. Passed 3-2-09.)
1301.05 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)    Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)    Appeal: A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)    Base Flood: The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)    Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)    Basement:  Any area of the building having its floor sub grade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)    Critical Development: Critical Development is that which is critical
to the community's public health and safety, are essential to the orderly
functioning of a community, store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-
reactive materials, or house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to
avoid loss of life or injury. Examples of critical development include jails,
hospitals, schools, fire stations, nursing homes, wastewater treatment
facilities, water plants, and gas/oil/propane storage facilities.
   (g)    Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (h)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See "Lowest Floor."
   (i)    Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (j)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (k)    Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (1)    Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)    The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
   (m)    Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U. S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (n)    Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions.
      (1)    Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)    Zones Al-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined
      (3)    Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)    Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)    Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)    Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)    Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (p)    Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (q)    Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
   (r)    Floodway:  
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (s)    Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)    Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)    Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)    Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)    Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (u)    Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (v)    Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories: LOMA, LOMR, and CLOMR.
   (w)    Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
   (x)    Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
   (y)    Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (z)    Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (aa)    Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (bb)    Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (cc)    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (dd)    New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village of Edgerton's
Flood Insurance Rate Map, September 1, 1987, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (ee)    Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (ff)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (gg)    Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.
   (hh)    Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ii)    Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (jj)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, AI-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (kk)    Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (ll)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (mm)    Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (nn)    Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)    Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)    Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)    Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (oo)   Variance: A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (pp)    Violation: The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations. (Ord. 861. Passed 3-2-09.)

and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)    In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)    Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)    Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)    Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)    The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1301.33 to
1301.38, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)    Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
      (Ord. 861. Passed 3-2-09.)
1301.23 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including flood,
tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the Floodplain
Administrator shall:
   (a)    Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
   (b)    Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and

1301.32 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)    Development in Floodways. 
      (1)    In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)    Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1301.21(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the mayor and the Chief Executive Officer of any
other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
   (b)    Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1301.32(a)(2), items A. and C.-E.
   (c)    Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)    The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)    Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)    The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Edgerton specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
      (4)    The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1301.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
   (d)    Compensatory Storage Required for Fill. Fill within the area of
special flood hazard shall result in no net loss of natural floodplain storage.
The volume of the loss of floodwater storage due to filling in the special
flood hazard area shall be offset by providing an equal volume of flood storage
by excavation or other compensatory measures at or adjacent to the development
site.
      (Ord. 861. Passed 3-2-09.)
1301.33 APPEALS BOARD ESTABLISHED.
   (a)    The Village Council shall appoint an Appeals Board consisting of the
Chairperson of the Planning Commission, Fiscal Officer, the Fire Chief,
President Pro-Tem of the Village Council and the Village Clerk Treasurer. Each
member shall serve until his/her successor is appointed.
   (b)    A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
The Office of the Edgerton Records Clerk located in the Edgerton Town Hall at
103 S. Michigan Ave., Edgerton, Ohio 43517-0609.
(Ord. 861. Passed 3-2-09.)

of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within seven (7) days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted. (Ord.
861. Passed 3-2-09.)
1301.36 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)    Application for a Variance.   
      (1)    Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)    Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (b)    Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold
a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an application
for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a
notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers of general
circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date of the
hearing.
   (c)    Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence, as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)    The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
      (5)    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
      (8)    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
      (10)    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)    The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
      (2)    A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
      (3)    A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
      (4)    A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
      (5)    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)    Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1301.36(c)(1) to (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
         (Ord. 861. Passed 3-2-09.)
1301.37 PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)    All testimony shall be given under oath.
