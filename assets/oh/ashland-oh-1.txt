   WHEREAS, the City has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.

and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council, now therefore,

thereto concurring:
   Section 1. That the ordinances of the City of Ashland, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Ashland, Ohio, 1980.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the City of Ashland,
Ohio.
   Section 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and
immediately after passage of this Ordinance and its approval by the Mayor. All
ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof enacted prior to January 31, 1980,
which are inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances, are
hereby repealed as of the effective date of this Ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or

necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety
of the residents of the City of Ashland, Ohio, and for the further reason that
there exists an imperative necessity for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
City, so as to facilitate administration, daily operation and avoid practical

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

PRELIMINARY PROCEEDINGS
PROCEEDINGS PRELIMINARY TO THE CHARTER
   On the 3rd of September, 1912, the people of Ohio adopted the following
provisions of the State Constitution, being Sections 7, 8 and 9 of Article
XVIII, authorizing cities to adopt the charter method for their government:
   Section 7. Any municipality may frame and adopt or amend a charter for its
government and may, subject to the provisions of Section 3 of this article,
exercise thereunder all powers of local self-government.
 
   Section 8. The legislative authority of any city or village may by a two-
thirds vote of its members, and upon petition of ten per centum of the electors
shall forthwith, provide by ordinance for the submission to the electors of the
question, "Shall a commission be chosen to frame a charter." The ordinance
providing for the submission of such question shall require that it be
submitted to the electors at the next regular municipal election if one shall
occur not less than sixty nor more than one hundred and twenty days after its
passage; otherwise it shall provide for the submission of the question at a
special election to be called and held within the time aforesaid. The ballot
containing such question shall bear no party designation, and provision shall
be made thereon for the election from the municipality at large of fifteen
electors who shall constitute a commission to frame a charter; provided that a
majority of the electors voting on such question shall have voted in the
affirmative. Any charter so framed shall be submitted to the electors of the
municipality at an election to be held at a time fixed by the charter
commission and within one year from the date of its election, provision for
which shall be made by the legislative authority of the municipality in so far
as not prescribed by general law. Not less than thirty days prior to such
election the clerk of the municipality shall mail a copy of the proposed
charter to each elector whose name appears upon the poll or registration books
of the last regular or general election held therein. If such proposed charter
is approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon it shall become the
charter of such municipality at the time fixed therein.
 
   Section 9. Amendments to any charter framed and adopted as herein provided
may be submitted to the electors of a municipality by a two-thirds vote of the
legislative authority thereof, and, upon petitions signed by ten per centum of
the electors of the municipality setting forth any such proposed amendment,
shall be submitted by such legislative authority. The submission of proposed
amendments to the electors shall be governed by the requirements of Section 8
as to the submission of the question of choosing a charter commission, and
copies of proposed amendments shall be mailed to the electors as hereinbefore
provided for copies of a proposed charter. If any such amendment is approved by
a majority of the electors voting thereon, it shall become a part of the
charter of the Municipality. A copy of said charter or any amendment thereto
shall be certified to the Secretary of State within thirty days after adoption
by a referendum vote.
   On the 7th day of April, 1913, the Council duly passed on ordinance to
provide for the submission to the electors of the City of Ashland the question,
"Shall a commission be chosen to frame a charter," and for the election of the
members of the commission, which ordinance was duly approved by the Mayor April
8th, 1913, which ordinance is as follows.
   Be it Ordained by the Council of the City of Ashland, State of Ohio, two-
thirds of all members elected thereto concurring;
 
   Section 1. That the question "Shall a commission be chosen to frame a
charter," be submitted to a vote of the qualified electors of the said City at
the special election to be held on Thursday the 19th day of June, 1913, at the
regular place or places of voting in said City, as established by the Board of

   (c)    By the foot frontage of the property bounding or abutting upon the
improvement.
SECTION 78. PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT.
   When it is deemed necessary to make a public improvement to be paid for in
whole or in part by special assessment, the Council shall declare the necessity
therefor by resolution, and such resolution shall include the method of
assessment, the mode of payment, and the number of annual installments. Such
resolution shall thereupon be certified to the Director of Finance and Public
Record, who shall thereupon proceed to make an assessment report, in accordance
with the method of assessment provided in the resolution, which report shall be
filed with the Council, and shall show the lots and lands assessed, and the
amount of the assessments as to each, and the number of installments not
exceeding ten (10), in which such assessment shall be paid.
SECTION 79. NOTICES SERVED.
   Upon the filing of such report the Director of Finance and Public Record
shall cause written notice to be served upon the owner or owners or the agent
or agents of the owner or owners of each lot or parcel of land to be assessed,
or upon the persons in whose names the same may be assessed for taxation upon
the tax duplicate, said notice to be served as is provided for service of
summons in civil action; and as to all nonresidents and persons who cannot be

SECTION 81. BOARD OF REVISION OF ASSESSMENTS.
   The Board of Revision of Assessments shall consist of the Mayor, the
Director of Law and the Director of Finance and Public Record. The Mayor shall
be the President of the Board and the Director of Finance and Public Record
shall be the Secretary thereof. It shall meet at such times and places as is
provided by its rules and shall hear all claims and objections as to the
character of all improvements to be paid for in part or in whole by special
assessments, the necessity therefor, and the equity of the assessments as
provided in the assessment report. A majority of those constituting the Board
of Revision of Assessments shall have power to determine all complaints and
objections submitted to it, and as to each improvement the Board shall, after
such hearing amend, equalize, and adjust the assessment report, and shall
report its findings as to the necessity for the improvements and any amendments
it directs in the assessments to the Council.
SECTION 82. CLAIMS.
   An owner of a lot or of land bounding and abutting upon a proposed
improvement claiming that he will sustain damage by reason of the improvement
shall present such claim to the Board of Revision of Assessments within two
weeks after the service of notice of the completion of the publication
hereinbefore provided. Such claim shall be in writing and shall set forth the
amount of damages claimed, with a general description of the property with
respect to which it is claimed the damage will accrue. Any owner who fails so
to do shall be deemed to have waived such damages and shall be barred from
filing a claim or receiving damages therefor. This provision shall apply to all
damages which will obviously result from the improvement, but shall not deprive
the owner of his right to recover damages arising without his fault, from acts
of the City or of its agents. The Board of Revision of Assessments shall report
to the Council all such claims for damages filed with it.
SECTION 83. FINAL ASSESSMENT.
   Whenever the Board of Revision of Assessments shall have made its final
report to the Council as to any improvement, the Council, if it determines that
the improvement shall proceed, shall pass an ordinance levying the assessment
as reported by the Board of Revision of Assessments and directing that the
improvement proceed.
   In such ordinance it shall be sufficient to describe the lots and lands
abutting upon the improvement and to be assessed therefor, as all the lots and
lands bounding and abutting upon such improvement between and including the
termini of the improvement; and in describing lands which do not abut it shall
be sufficient to describe the lots by their appropriate lot numbers, and the
lands by metes and bounds; and this rule of description shall apply in all
proceedings in which lots and lands are to be charged with special assessments.
   Special assessments shall be payable by the owners of the property assessed
at the time stipulated in the ordinance, and shall be a lien from the date of
the assessment upon the respective lots and parcels of land assessed
enforceable in the manner provided by general law.
SECTION 84. DAMAGES ASSESSED.
   At the time of the passage of the ordinance determining to proceed with the
improvement as hereinbefore provided, the Council shall determine whether the
claims for damages so filed shall be judicially inquired into before commencing
or after the completion of the proposed improvement. If it decides that the
damages shall be assessed before commencing the improvement, the Director of
Law shall then make a written application to a court of competent jurisdiction
for inquiry into, and assessment of such damages, which inquiry and assessment
shall be confined to such claims.
   When the Council determines to assess the damages after the completion of
the improvement for which a claim for damages has been filed as hereinbefore
provided, the Director of Law shall within ten (10) days after the completion
of the improvement make written application as hereinbefore provided in the
case of the ascertainment of damages before the improvement was made, and the
same proceedings shall be had.
   No person who claims damages arising from any cause shall commence a suit
therefor against the City until he shall have filed a claim for such damages
with the Director of Finance and Public Record and sixty (60) days shall have
elapsed thereafter, to enable the City to take such steps as it may deem proper
to settle or adjust the claim; but this provision shall not apply to an
application for an injunction or other proceeding to which it may be necessary
for such applicant to resort in case of urgent necessity.
SECTION 85. WORK TO BE DONE.
   When the Council shall have passed an ordinance directing an improvement to
be made, to be paid for in whole or in part by special assessments the Mayor
shall, as provided by ordinance, either directly by the employment of labor or
by entering into a contract therefor, cause the improvement to be made.
SECTION 86. LANDS UNALLOTTED OR NOT ON DUPLICATE.
   When special assessments are levied by the percentage of tax value of the
property assessed or by the foot frontage of the property bounding and abutting
upon the improvement, and there are lands subject to such assessment which are
not assessed for taxation, the Director of Finance and Public Record shall fix,
for the purpose of such assessment, the value of such lots as they stand and of
such lands at such depths as the Director of Finance and Public Record
considers a fair average of the assessed value of other lots in the
neighborhood, and where lands are not subdivided into lots but are assessed for
taxation, the Director of Finance and Public Record shall fix the value and the
depth in the same manner; but the above rule shall not apply in making a
special assessment according to benefits.
SECTION 87. INTEREST ON ASSESSMENT BONDS.
   When bonds or notes are issued in anticipation of the collection of
assessments, the interest thereon shall be treated as part of the cost of the
improvement for which the assessments may be made.
SECTION 88. LIMITATION ON ASSESSMENTS.
   The Council shall limit all assessments to the special benefits conferred
upon the property assessed, and in no case shall there be levied on any lot or
parcel of land any assessments for any or all purposes within a period of five
years in excess of thirty-three and one-third percent (33- 1/3%) of the actual
value thereof after the improvement is made unless the owner or owners of such
property shall, in writing waive the said limitation. Assessments levied for
the construction of main sewers shall not exceed the sum that, in the opinion
of Council, would be required to construct an ordinary street sewer or drain of
sufficient capacity to drain or sewer the lots or lands to be assessed for such
improvement, nor shall any lots or lands be assessed that do not need local
drainage, or which are provided therewith.
SECTION 89. CITY'S PORTION OF COST.
(Repealed by Voters 11-8-55)
SECTION 90. REPLACING EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS.
   The Council may provide in whole or in part the cost of replacing any
improvement existing in the street at the time of the adoption of this Charter,
by levying special assessments as hereinbefore provided; but any assessment for
such replacement in less than twenty (20) years from the date of a prior
assessment for the improvement to be replaced shall be limited to a sum not in
excess of thirty-three and one-third percent (33-1/3%) of the cost of such
replacement.
SECTION 91. SUBSEQUENT IMPROVEMENTS.
   Every ordinance providing for an improvement to be paid for in whole or in
part by special assessments passed subsequent to the adoption of this Charter,
shall contain an estimate by the City Engineer of the life of the proposed
improvement. Any assessment thereafter made for replacing such improvement
within such period of estimated life shall be limited to a sum not in excess of
thirty-three and one-third percent (33-1/3%) of the cost of such replacement.
Assessments for replacements at or after the expiration of such estimated
period of life shall be subject to no limitation except as provided for
assessments for original improvements.
   
SECTION 92. SUPPLEMENTARY ASSESSMENTS AND REBATES.
   Upon the completion of any improvement the Director of Finance and Public
Record shall rebate to the then owner of the property which shall have been
assessed to pay for such improvement, any surplus or excess remaining
unexpended for the purpose for which such assessment was made, and in the event
of there being a deficit in the fund provided for the making of any such
improvement the Director of Finance and Public Record shall report to the
Council a supplementary assessment within the limitations hereinbefore
provided, which supplementary assessment shall be made by ordinance of the
Council and certified for collection as is provided in the case of original
assessments, but no such supplementary assessment shall be levied after the
expiration of one year from the date of the completion of the improvement.
SECTION 93. SEWER AND WATER CONNECTIONS.
   The Mayor shall have authority to compel the making of sewer and water
connections whenever, in view of contemplated street improvements or as a
sanitary regulation, sewer or water connection should in his judgment be
constructed. He shall cause written notice of his determination thereof to be
given to the owner or the agent of such owner of each lot or parcel of land to
which such connections are to be made, which notice to the owner or the agent
of such owner of each lot or parcel of land to which such connections are to be
made, which notice shall state the number and character of connections
required. Such notice shall be served by a person designated by the Mayor in
the manner provided for the service of summons in civil actions. Nonresidents
of the City, or persons who cannot be found, may be served by one publication
of such notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, which notice
shall state the time within which such connections shall be constructed; and if
they be not constructed within the said time, the work may be done by the City
and the cost thereof, together with a penalty of five percent (55tc) assessed
against the lots and lands for which such connections are made. Said
assessments shall be certified and collected as other assessments for street
improvements.
SECTION 94. SIDEWALKS.
   The Council may by resolution declare that certain specified sidewalks,
curbing, or gutters shall be constructed or repaired. Upon the passage of such
a resolution the Clerk of the Council shall cause written notice of the passage
thereof to be served upon the owner, or agent of the owner, of each parcel of
land abutting upon such sidewalk, who may be a resident of the City, in the
manner provided by law for the service of summons in civil actions. He shall
return a copy of the notice with the time and manner of service endorsed
thereon, signed by the person serving it, to the Mayor who shall file and
preserve such return. For the purpose of such service, if the owner of any such
property be not a resident of the City, any person charged with the collection
of rent, or the payment of taxes on such property, or having control thereof in
any way, shall be regarded as the agent of the owner, and service upon such
person shall have the like force and effect as though personal service were
made upon the owner thereof. If it appear in any such return, however, that the
owner is a nonresident, or that neither such owner nor agent could be found,
one publication of a copy of the resolution in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City shall be deemed sufficient notice to such owner. If
such sidewalks, curbings or gutters be not constructed or repaired within
thirty (30) days from the service of notice, or the completion of the
publication, the Mayor may proceed by direct employment of labor, or by
contract to do, or have done, the said construction or repair at the expense of
the owner, as in the case of other improvements, and all such expense shall be
reported by the Mayor to the Council. The Council shall thereupon by ordinance
assess the cost and expense thereof upon the owners of all the property
bounding or abutting thereon, and such assessments shall be collected in the
same manner with a penalty of five percent (5%) and interest for failure to pay
at the time fixed by the assessment resolution.
SECTION 95. FURTHER PROCEEDINGS UNNECESSARY.
   No proceedings for the construction or repair of sidewalks, curbings, and
gutters, and levying assessments therefor, shall be necessary other than the
proceedings required under this and the preceding section. In any case in which
special assessments may be made on property for all the cost of constructing or
repairing sidewalks, curbings, or gutters, such assessment within the limit of
thirty-three and one third percent (33-1/3%) of the real value of the property
shall be a valid assessment thereon except as provided in Section
88 of this Charter.
SECTION 96. ASSESSMENT BONDS.
   The Council may at any time borrow money and authorize the issuance of notes
or bonds therefor in anticipation of the collection of assessments levied for
the purpose of paying the cost of constructing or repairing sidewalks, which
are to be or have been constructed by the Mayor upon the failure of the owners
of the property to construct or repair the same, pursuant to notice as
hereinbefore provided.
SECTION 97. ALTERATIONS OR MODIFICATIONS IN CONTRACT.
   When it becomes necessary, in the opinion of the Mayor or in the prosecution
of any work or improvement under contract, to make alterations or modifications
in such contract, such alterations or modifications shall be made only upon the
order of said Mayor in writing. Provided, however, that such alterations or
modifications must be approved by the Council in case such involves an
additional expenditure exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). No such
order shall be effective until the price to be paid for the work and material,
or both, under the altered or modified contract, has been agreed upon in
writing and signed by the contractor and the Mayor in behalf of the City.

subdivision, describing with certainty all grounds laid out, or granted for
streets, alleys, ways, commons, or other public uses. Lots sold or intended for
sale shall be numbered by progressive numbers, or described by the squares in
which situated, and the precise length and width shall be given of such lot
sold, or intended for sale. Such map or plat shall be subscribed by the
proprietor, or his agent duly authorized in writing, acknowledged before an
officer authorized to take the acknowledgment of deeds, who shall certify the
acknowledgment of the instrument; and recorded in the office of the County
Recorder.
SECTION 99. FEE SHALL VEST IN CITY.
   The map or plat so recorded shall thereupon be a sufficient conveyance to
vest in the City the fee of the parcel or parcels of land designated or
intended for streets, alleys, ways, commons, or other public uses, to be held
in the corporate name in trust to and for the uses and purposes in the
instrument set forth, expressed, designated or intended.

the City shall be deemed a public street or alley, or under the care or control
of the Council, unless the dedication is accepted and confirmed by ordinance
passed for such purpose.
SECTION 105. VACATION OR CHANGE OF NAME.
   The Council vacating any street or part of street or changing the name of
any street may include in one ordinance the change of name or the vacation or
narrowing of more than one street, avenue, or alley, but before vacating any
street or part thereof, or narrowing any street, the Council shall first pass a
resolution declaring its intention so to do. The Clerk of the Council shall
cause notice of such declaration to be served in the manner that service of
summons is required to be made upon all persons whose property abuts upon the
part of the street affected by the proposed vacation or narrowing and by
publication once in one newspaper of general circulation in the City as to all
the persons who cannot be personally served. Said notice shall state the time
and place when objections can be heard before the Board of Revision of
Assessments. Upon the report by the Board of Revision of Assessments approving
the proposed vacation or narrowing, the Council may by ordinance declare such
vacation or narrowing, and such order of Council vacating or narrowing a street
or alley which has been dedicated to public use by the proprietor, shall to the
extent to which it is vacated or narrowed operate as a revocation of the
acceptance thereof by Council, but the right of way and easement therein of any
lot owner shall not be impaired thereby.
SECTION 106. TAXATION.
   The Council shall levy taxes within the limitations provided by law for the
purpose of paying the expense of constructing improvements and exercising
powers of the City.
APPROPRIATION OF PROPERTY
SECTION 107. APPROPRIATION.

of, and in the manner provided by the general law.

reading shall be necessary, the Clerk of the Council shall cause written notice
thereof to be given to the owner, person in possession thereof, or having an
interest of record in, every piece of land sought to be appropriated, or to his
authorized agent, and such notice shall be served by a person designated for
the purpose, and return made in the manner provided by law for the service and
return of summons in civil actions. If such owner, person, or agent, cannot be
found, notice shall be given by publication once a week for three consecutive
weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, and the Council may
thereafter pass an ordinance directing such appropriation to proceed.
SECTION 110. FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.
   Upon the passage of such ordinance the Director of Law shall make
application to a court of competent jurisdiction or to a judge thereof in
vacation, which application shall describe as correctly as possible the land or
other property to be appropriated, the interest or estate therein to be taken,
the object for which the land is desired, and the name of the owner or each lot
or parcel thereof, and all the subsequent proceedings with regard thereto shall
be in the manner provided by general law for the appropriation of property by

that its construction or operation is an additional burden upon the rights of
the property owners in such highways or public grounds.
SECTION 116. REGULATIONS.
   The Council shall at all times control the distribution of space in, over,
under or across all streets or public grounds occupied by public utility
fixtures. All rights granted for the construction and operation of public

            (ORC 1.14)

after a day named, no part of that day shall be included.
         (ORC 1.15)
      (5)   In all cases where the law shall require any act to be done in a

of such duty or compliance with such notice.

well be done by an agent as by the principal, such requirement shall be
construed to include all such acts when done by an authorized agent.
   (e)   Joint Authority. All words purporting to give joint authority to three
or more municipal officers or other persons shall be construed as giving such
authority to a majority of such officers or other persons, unless it shall be
otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority or inconsistent
with State statute or Charter provisions.
   (f)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which
shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when the
subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04 REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). A separate offense
shall be deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or
occurs.

155.02 SICK LEAVE.
   (a)    Each full-time employee, which for the purposes of this section shall
be defined as any employee whose regularly scheduled service consists of
thirty-two hours or more, who has completed eighty hours of service shall be
entitled, for each completed eighty hours of service, to sick leave of four and
six-tenths (4.6) hours with pay. Employees may use sick leave, upon approval of
the department head, for absence due to personal illness, pregnancy, injury,
exposure to contagious disease which could be communicated to other employees,
or due to illness, injury, or death in the employee's immediate family. In the
case of death in the employee's immediate family, sick leave granted for this
reason shall not exceed three days. The term "immediate family" as used in this
section shall include the following: mother, father, brother, sister, child or
stepchild, spouse, grandparent, grandchild, mother-in-law, father-in-law,
brother-in-law, sister- in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandparent-in-
law, legal guardian or other person who stands in the place of parent (in loco
parentis) of the employee or employee's spouse. When sick leave is used, it
shall be deducted from the employee's credit on the basis of one hour for every
one hour of absence from previously scheduled work.
(Ord. 3-79. Passed 1-15-79.)
   (b)    Each employee, at the time of retirement from active service with the
City and with ten or more years of service with the City, may elect to be paid
in cash for one-fourth of the value of his accrued but unused sick leave
credit. Such payment shall be based on the employee's rate of pay at the time
of retirement. Payment for sick leave on this basis shall be considered to
eliminate all sick leave credit accrued by the employee at that time. Such
payment shall be made only once to any employee. The maximum payment which may
be made under this paragraph shall be for one-fourth of 344 days. Due to the
varying work schedules of employees of the City a "day", within the meaning of
this paragraph, shall consist of the number of hours as follows: (Ord. 38-01.
Passed 4-3-01.)
      (1)    6.4 hours for a regular work week of 32 hours.
      (2)    8.0 hours for a regular work week of 40 hours.
      (3)    10.6 hours for an average regular work week of 53 hours, as in the
case of members of the Fire Department.
      (4)    In the case of any other regular work week, in excess of 32 hours,
the number of hours in a "day", for the purposes of this provision, shall be
determined by dividing the number of hours of the regular work week by five,
with the result thereof being the number of hours in a day for that work
schedule.
   (c)    In the event of the death of an active employee of the City, having
at the time of death, ten or more years of service with the City, the estate of
such employee shall be entitled to be paid in cash for one-fourth of the value
of his accrued but unused sick leave credit, subject to the same limitations
and provisions as set forth above.
   (d)    Overtime service shall not be considered in determining an employee's
regular work week.
   (e)    Previously accumulated sick leave of an employee who has been
separated from the public service shall be placed to his credit upon his re-
employment in the public service, provided that such re-employment takes place
within ten years of the date on which the employee was last terminated from
public service, and provided further that the employee was in good standing at
the time of such termination. An employee who transfers from one public agency
to the City shall be credited with the unused balance of his sick leave
accumulated in the public agency from which the employee transfers. The
department head shall require an employee to furnish a satisfactory written,
signed statement to justify the use of sick leave, setting forth the reason for
the use thereof. If medical attention is required, the department head and/or
Mayor may require a certificate stating the nature of the illness from a
licensed physician to justify the use of sick leave. Falsification of either a
written, signed statement or a physician's certificate shall be grounds for
disciplinary action including dismissal. This section shall be uniformly
administered to all employees of the City.
   (f)   In order to receive compensation while absent on sick leave, each
employee shall promptly take steps, in the manner as may be specified by the
department head, to notify his immediate superior of his illness and,
thereafter, shall make written application for such compensation. When such
absence is for more than two days, the employee concerned, in order to receive
compensation, must file with his request for sick leave compensation a
certificate from a registered physician stating that such employee was unable
during the whole of such absence to perform his duties, or submit other
satisfactory proof of such illness.
(Ord. 3-79. Passed 1-16-79.)
   (g)    ( EDITOR'S NOTE: This subsection was repealed by Ordinance 27-86,
passed May 20, 1986. )
155.03 VACATIONS.
   (a)   There is created, for and during the period of each calendar year, a
vacation period for each of the employees of the City, other than elected
officials. Each employee must be employed by the City at the time the vacation
is taken. When an employee's employment by the City terminates, then the
vacation benefit ceases.
   (b)   Each full-time employee, which for the purposes of this section shall
be defined as any employee whose regularly scheduled service consists of
thirty-two hours or more, excluding elected officials, who has been employed by
the City for one year or more of continuous employment shall be eligible for
two weeks vacation. Thereafter, eligibility for vacations shall be as follows:
      (1)   After the completion of seven years continuous service - three
weeks vacation.
      (2)   After the completion of fourteen years continuous service - four
weeks vacation.
      (3)   After the completion of twenty years continuous service - five
weeks vacation.
   (c)   Employees will receive full pay when taking their vacation, and pay
will be based on the normal work week schedule of their department. Salaried
employees will receive one fifty- second of their yearly salary for each week
of vacation.
   (d)   If any employees entitled to a vacation under this section are
deceased before taking their vacations, their heirs or estates will receive the
vacation pay the deceased employee would have received.
   (e)   Employees who resign will receive their vacation pay, provided they
give notice in writing to the department head or Mayor at least two weeks prior
to their separation. Employees who are separated from employment by the City
because of a reduction in force will receive their vacation with pay before
separation of employment.
   (f)   Vacations are to be taken at such times and in such manner so as not
to hinder or interrupt the operations of the various departments and shall be
at the discretion of the Mayor and the department director.
   
   (g)   Any employee may work up to one week of his or her annual vacation in
lieu of taking time off and receive additional compensation therefor at the
employee's regular rate, but only in such instances where the service of the
employee is deemed essential, during such period, by the appropriate department
head and is approved in advance thereof by the Mayor.
(Ord. 27-79. Passed 4-17-79; Ord. 23-86. Passed 5-6-86.)
   (h)   An employee may request that vacation time be carried over from one
year to another but not without the express written authorization of the
appropriate division director and elected position. This carry-over shall be
limited to one week. Any other amount of vacation time that is unused within
the year granted, unless a carry-over is granted shall be deemed forfeited.
(Ord. 49-93. Passed 6-15-93.)
   (i)   Subject to the approval of Council, each appointing authority shall
have the authority in order to secure and/or to maintain the service of
qualified and able employees and officers of the City, of advancing to such
employees and officers vacation time/annual leave to be utilized during a
current calendar year, and to be credited against the vacation time/annual
leave earned or accumulated during the next calendar year. In the event that an
officer or employee of the City, after having been afforded such privilege, and
after having utilized such vacation time/annual leave terminates his or her
employment with the City, for whatever reason, prior to his or her earning all
or any part of the utilized but unearned, vacation time/annual leave, there
shall be a charge against the officer or employee and any or all amounts due to
him or her from the City.
   (j)   As to any employee of the City hired or employed after January 4,
2000, each appointing authority, subject to approval of Council, shall have the
authority to secure the service of qualified and able employees or officers of
the City, to afford each such employee or officer, at the time of his or her
employment, credit for all or any part of the prior employment of such employee
or officer which, in the judgment and opinion of the appointing authority is
related to the position of employment, service, and/or trust of the employee or
officer with the City, and which in the opinion and judgment of the appointing
authority has afforded such employee or officer in his or her service to the
City. All such periods of prior employment for which credit is allowed
hereunder shall be utilized in the computation and allowance of vacation time/

   (i)    Business Allocation Percentage Formula (Ohio R.C. 718.02).
      (1)    In the taxation of income which is subject to municipal income
taxes, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or
profession both within and without the boundaries of a municipal corporation
disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profits is
attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted within the
boundaries of the municipal corporation, then only such portion shall be
considered as having a taxable situs in such municipal corporation for purposes
of municipal income taxation. In the absence of such records, net profit from a
business or profession, conducted both within and without the boundaries of a
municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable situs in such
municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of:
         A.    The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in such
municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average net book value
of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer
in the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in this subparagraph, real property shall include property rented or
leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by
multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         B.    Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in such municipal corporation to wages, salaries and other compensation paid
during the same period to persons employed in the business or profession,
wherever their services are performed;
         C.    Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in such municipal corporation to
gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales
and services, wherever made or performed.
In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations be substituted
so as to produce such result.
      (2)    As used in subparagraph (1) hereof, "sales made in a municipal
corporation" means:
         A.    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered
within such municipal corporation regardless of where title passes if shipped
or delivered from a stock of goods within such municipal corporation;
         B.    All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered
within such municipal corporation regardless of where title passes even though
transported from a point outside such municipal corporation if the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion;
         C.   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within such municipal corporation to purchasers outside such municipal
corporation, regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through
its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales
at the place where delivery is made.

for each calendar year on or before April 30 of each ensuing year by all such
taxpayers.
   Such declaration shall be filed on a form, prescribed by the Director of
Finance and Public Record and furnished by the Director, which form may simply
state that the figures used in making such declaration are the figures used in
making the declaration of the estimate for the Federal income tax, providing
that it is understood that such figures may be modified according to the
provisions of the Codified Ordinances where necessary in order that the
declaration required by this section shall set forth only such income as is
taxable under the provisions of this Title Nine.
   For individuals, the declaration to be filed on or before April 30, 2003,
and the declaration to be filed on or before April 30 of each ensuing year
shall be accompanied by payment of at least 22-1/2% of the estimated Ashland
Municipal Income Tax, and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before
July 31, October 31 and January 31 of such taxable year. For calendar year
taxpayers that are not individuals, 22-1/2% by the taxpayer’s Federal return
filing date, 45% by June 15, 67-1/2% by September 15, and 90% by December 15,
and for fiscal year taxpayers that are not individuals, 22-1/2% by the 15th day
of the fourth month of the taxpayer’s taxable year, 45% by the 15th day of the
sixth month, 67-1/2% by the 15th day of the ninth month, and 90% by the 15th
day of the 12th month. Any amount deducted and withheld for taxes from an
individual’s compensation is considered as estimated taxes paid in equal
amounts of the prescribed payment dates. Such estimate may be amended at the
time of the making of any quarterly payment and, on or before April 30 of the
year following that for which the declaration was filed, a final return shall
be filed and any balance which may be due the City shall be paid therewith.
Should it appear that such taxpayer has paid more than the amount of the tax to
which the City would be entitled, a refund of the amount so overpaid shall be
made, or same may be applied toward the declaration of tax due for the ensuing
year. Claims for refunds shall be made on forms prescribed by and obtainable
from the Director.

income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation, and on net
profits as hereinafter provided in Section
230.03 of Chapter

be appropriated and disbursed for the purpose of defraying all costs of

         (b)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in

230.12 (A).
         (c)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F) (2) (a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section

everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)   An individual who is a resident of the City of Ashland shall

employee or owner for services performed at that individual's qualifying remote

location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c), and notwithstanding
division (F)(4), any gross receipts of the business or profession from services
performed during the taxable period by a qualifying remote employee or owner

      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or
the Tax Administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to
all or a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment
method as described in division (F). However, the Tax Administrator shall not
require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it would
require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with solely because a qualifying
remote employee's or owner’s qualifying remote work location is located in the
City of Ashland.

division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages

or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the City of Ashland
income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and
constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is

qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in the City of
Ashland.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the City of Ashland and the

employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the

outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Ashland.
         To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator

      (6)   Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement

      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or

"Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's
federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal

of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit

profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
       (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City of Ashland to determine and verify the
taxpayer's municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under
division (F) of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on
a generic form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.

230, each return required to be filed under this section shall be completed and

automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City of Ashland income
tax return. The extended due date of the City of Ashland's income tax return
shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year
to which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this division
is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator
grants an extension of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City of Ashland income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's the City of Ashland income tax
return. If the request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the
date the City of Ashland income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall
grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
City of Ashland's income tax return. The extended due date of the City of
Ashland income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the
state income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City of Ashland, the Tax Administrator
may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as
provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file
annual returns.
      (5)   (a)    If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a
municipal income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section,
the Tax Administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the
taxpayer with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the
return or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever
occurs first.
         (b)    If the Tax Administrator violates division (G)(5) of this
section, the City of Ashland shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable
costs incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to one hundred fifty
dollars.
         (c)    Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the Tax Administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2)(a) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.

net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City of Ashland for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(l) of this section shall file with the
City of Ashland an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this

      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City of Ashland's income tax
ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with the City of
Ashland for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed
services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(l)(g)) within the
City of Ashland.
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in the City of
Ashland and does not expect to be subject to the City of Ashland's income tax
for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City of Ashland. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the City of Ashland, make any sales in the City of Ashland, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the City of Ashland during the
taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the City
of Ashland for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer
and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City of Ashland's income tax
ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H) (3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
      (4)   The City of Ashland shall not require a person to file a net profit
return under this section if the person's income consists exclusively of exempt
income described in Section
230.02(C) (12).
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made the date of the timestamp assigned
by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the City of Ashland by an employer, the agent of an
employer, or other payer as described in Section
230.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City of Ashland, unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the City of Ashland and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the City of Ashland to be filed in accordance
with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
 
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City of Ashland,
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the City of Ashland or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer
or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the
provisions of this Chapter and of the City of Ashland's ordinance, resolution,
or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports, or
documents.

amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer

Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a

States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian

support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City of
Ashland for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension
of time for payment of taxes required by the City of Ashland during the period

application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the
member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or

otherwise due to the municipal corporation before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.

division the application of divisions(N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by a municipal corporation in
accordance with Chapter

taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this division,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the president of the

support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2) (a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C) (2) (a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

   (R)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated

consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.

Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
   (S)   (l)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City of
Ashland's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (S)(l) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (S) (1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (S) (1)
or (2) of section 718.80 is binding upon the state Tax Commissioner for the
remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code is
terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code is
binding upon the municipal tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period.
   (T)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City of Ashland income tax return for that taxable year if
the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the City of Ashland. A taxpayer that is required
to file a consolidated City of Ashland income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated City of Ashland income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission
from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City of Ashland income tax
return in the same manner as is required under the United States department of

consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (l)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
230.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated City of Ashland income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
230.02 (C)(l) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City of Ashland income tax
return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's
net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
230.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass- through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the

entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City of Ashland;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City of Ashland
income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)   Corporations filing a consolidated City of Ashland income tax return
shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
230.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
 
   (X)   Each corporation filing a consolidated City of Ashland income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the City of Ashland in accordance with

agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation.

including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on
or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after

   (D)   (l)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
230.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless

this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:

and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;

division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City of Ashland under Section
230.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City of Ashland
but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 1-24. Passed 1-2-24.)
230.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS. 
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under Chapter
230. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds fifty cents shall

document.
(Ord. 1-24. Passed 1-2-24.)
230.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
230.18.
   (B)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the municipal corporation:
      (1)   Overpayments often dollars ($10.00) or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars
($10.00) or more.
   (C)   (l)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
230.21.
   (D)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
230.18 (A) (4).
 
   (F)   Ashland will not refund taxes for which it has not collected the
appropriate income tax revenue.
(Ord. 1-24. Passed 1-2-24.)
230.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Ashland, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City
of Ashland as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City of Ashland is subject to recovery by the City
of Ashland. If the City of Ashland's tax on that income is imposed after the
time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to the other
municipality, the City of Ashland shall allow a nonrefundable credit against
the tax or withholding the City of Ashland claims is due with respect to such
income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the first municipality
with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)   If the City of Ashland's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City of Ashland's tax rate. However, if the City of Ashland's tax rate is
greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of
the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the City of Ashland, along with any
penalty and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 1-24. Passed 1-2-24.)
230.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (l)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the City of Ashland changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return
with the City of Ashland. The amended return shall be filed on a form required
by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (l)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due.,_ together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
230.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
       (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (l)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City of Ashland. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
230.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City of Ashland's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended City of Ashland return showing income
subject to the City of Ashland income tax based upon such final determination
of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City
of Ashland income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any
overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).
(Ord. 1-24. Passed 1-2-24.)
230.12 LIMITATIONS.

            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(l)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
file with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
230.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
          (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to

required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
230.09.
   (D)   (l)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City of Ashland does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
230.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
230.09.
   (E)   No civil action to recover City of Ashland income tax or related
penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following time
periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that

         (Ord. 1-24. Passed 1-2-24.)
230.13 AUDITS. 
   (A)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 1-24. Passed 1-2-24.)
230.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)   Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (l)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City of Ashland official,
or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C) (1) (a) of this section is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
         "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
         Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
         If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)
(1) (a) of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (l)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D) (1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
(60) days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City of
Ashland official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this
division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a

231.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have
the following meanings ascribed to them respectively:
   (a)    "Director" means the Director of Finance of the City of Ashland.
   (b)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered for a consideration to guests, in which five or more rooms are used for
the accommodation of guests, whether the rooms are in one or several
structures.
   (c)    "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to-the use or
possession of any room or rooms, or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use
or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet
or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space shall not be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person
exercising the right uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess, all
or any portion of the room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes.
   (d)   “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in
the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other
capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of
any type or character, other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be
deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same
duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this
chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
   (e)   “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (f)   “Rent” means the consideration received for occupancy valued in money,
whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits
and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for which
the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.
   (g)   “Transient guest” means a person occupying a room or rooms for
sleeping accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
      (Ord. 10-93. Passed 1-19-93.)
231.02 RATE OF TAX.
   (a)   Commencing on January 1, 1997, there is levied a tax of three percent
(3%) on all rents received by a hotel lodging furnished to transient guests,
the total receipts of which shall be deposited in the General Fund.
(Ord. 70-96. Passed 10-15-96.)
   (b)   This tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City,
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City. The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the
hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guest ceasing to occupy space in the hotel.
   If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the
Director may require that the tax be paid directly to the Director.
(Ord. 10-93. Passed 1-19-93.)
231.03 EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)    No tax shall be imposed under this chapter:
      (1)    Upon rents not within the taxing power of the City under the
Constitution or laws of Ohio or the United States;
      (2)    Upon rents paid by the State or any of its political subdivisions;
      (3)    Upon rents of five dollars ($5.00) a day or less.
 
   (b)    No exemption claimed under subsections (a)(l) or (2) hereof shall be
granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and,
under penalty of perjury, upon a form prescribed by the Director. All claims of
exemption under subsection (a)(3) hereof shall be made in the manner prescribed
by the Director.
(Ord. 10-93. Passed 1-19-93.)
231.04 TAX TO BE SEPARATELY STATED AND CHARGED.
   (a)    The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from
the rent and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy, or any bill or statement or charge made for an occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
 
   (b)    No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be
assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent,
or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter
provided.
(Ord. 10-93. Passed 1-19-93.)

person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient

purpose of collecting from transient guests the Transient Occupancy Tax and
remitting said tax to the Director. This certificate does not constitute a
permit."
      (Ord. 10-93. Passed 1-19-93.)
231.06 REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   Each operator shall, on or before the last day of each month, make a return
to the Director, on forms provided by the Director, of the total rents charged
and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies during
the preceding month. All claims for exemption from the tax filed by occupants
with the operator during the reporting period shall be filed with the report.
At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be
remitted to the Director. The Director may require further information in the
return if the information is pertinent to the collection of the tax. Returns
and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All
taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust
for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Director. All
returns and payments submitted by each operator shall be treated as
confidential by the Director, and shall not be released by him except upon
order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or to an officer or agent of the
United States, the State, the County or the City, for official use only.
(Ord. 10-93. Passed 1-19-93.)
231.07 PENALTIES AND INTEREST.

chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten percent (10%)
of the amount of the tax in addition to the tax.
   (b)    Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to pay any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty equal

the tax and the ten percent (10%) penalty first imposed. An additional penalty
equal to ten percent (10%) of the total tax and penalty of the previous thirty-
day period shall be added for each successive thirty-day period that the
account remains delinquent.
   (c)    Fraud. If the Director determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition
to the penalties stated in subsection (a) hereof.
   (d)    Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one percent (1%) per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the
tax exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became
delinquent until paid.

under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for in Section

231.08 FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT TAX; DETERMINATION OF DIRECTOR.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax, or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Director shall proceed in such
manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his
estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Director procures such facts and
information upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make a report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and
assess against the operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by
this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Director shall give
notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally, or by disposing it
in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his
last known place of address. The operator may within ten days after the serving
or mailing of the notice make application in writing to the Director for a
hearing on the amount assessed. If an application by the operator for a hearing
is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if
any, determined by the Director, shall become final and conclusive, and
immediately due and payable. If an application is made, the Director shall give
not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the
operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount
specified therein should not be fixed for the tax, interest and penalties. At
the hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why the specified tax,
interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After the hearing, the Director
shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall give written notice to
the person in the manner prescribed herein of the determination and the amount
of the tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be
payable after fifteen days, unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section
231.09.
(Ord. 10-93. Passed 1-19-93.)
231.09 APPEAL.

amount of the tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Board of
Review by filing a notice of appeal with the Director within fifteen days of
the serving or mailing of the determination of the tax due. The Board shall fix
a time and place for hearing the appeal and shall give notice in writing to the
operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the Board shall be
served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of a
notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and
payable upon the service of notice.
(Ord. 10-93. Passed 1-19-93.)

procedural rules and shall keep a record of its transactions. Any hearings by

imposed by this chapter shall keep and preserve, for a period of three years,

Director shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

overpaid, or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally
collected or received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as
provided in subsections (b) and (c) hereof provided a claim in writing
therefor, stating, under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds upon which
the claim is founded, is filed with the Director within three years of the date
of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Director.
   (b)    An operator may claim a refund or take as a credit against taxes

satisfaction of the Director that the transient guest has been unable to obtain

without paying any fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if

to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and

313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
313.03 TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception. This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings.
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62. (ORC 4511.13)

   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used. (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant

under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

may petition the court for occupational or educational driving privileges
without being accompanied by the holder’s parent or guardian during the period
of time specified in that subsection. The court may grant the person such
driving privileges if the court finds reasonable cause to believe that the
restrictions established in subsection (c)(1) will seriously affect the
person’s ability to continue in employment or educational training or will
cause undue hardship on the license holder or a family member of the license
holder. In granting the driving privileges, the court shall specify the
purposes, times, and places of the privileges and shall issue the person
appropriate forms setting forth the privileges granted. Occupational or

determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of

   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of

neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that

the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual

operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.

R.C. 3781.111(C) shall be mounted on a fixed or movable post, and the distance
from the ground to the bottom edge of the sign shall measure not less than five
feet. If a new sign or a replacement sign designating an accessible parking

location in violation of subsections (f)(1)A.1. or (f)(1)A.2. of this section
may be towed or otherwise removed from the parking location by the law
enforcement agency of the municipality. A motor vehicle that is so towed or
removed shall not be released to its owner until the owner presents proof of
ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the
lessee presents proof that the person is the lessee of the motor vehicle and
pays all towing and storage fees normally imposed by the municipality for
towing and storing motor vehicles.

or (f)(1)A.2. of this section, it is an affirmative defense to the charge that
the person suffered an injury not more than seventy-two hours prior to the time
the person was issued the ticket or citation and that, because of the injury,

person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk and is
displaying a removable windshield placard or accessible license plates, or when
a motor vehicle is being operated by or for the transport of a person with a
disability, and is displaying a parking card or accessible license plates, the
motor vehicle is permitted to park for a period of two hours in excess of the
legal parking period permitted by local authorities, except where local
ordinances or police rules provide otherwise or where the vehicle is parked in
such a manner as to be clearly a traffic hazard.
   (h)   No owner of an office, facility, or parking garage where accessible
parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with subsection
(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed
or movable signs.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person or
organization to apply for a removable windshield placard or accessible license
plates if the parking card or accessible license plates, issued to the person
or organization under prior law have not expired or been surrendered or
revoked.

         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,

electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio

wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:

offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.

501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.

Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
 
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not

plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).

541.01 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If
the offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty
service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)    In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

360 days of the alleged violation with the Board a complaint in writing, sworn
to or affirmed, which shall state the name and address of the person alleged to
have committed the violation complained of and the particulars thereof, and
such other information as may be required by the Board. The Board may also
corroborate or initiate complaints on the basis of testing carried out by its
staff or volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)    Upon the filing of a complaint the executive secretary of the Board
shall make such investigation as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and
issues. If the executive secretary shall determine that there are reasonable
grounds to believe a violation has occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the
matter by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all interested
parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to assist them.
Conciliation conferences shall be informal and nothing said or done during such
initial conference shall be made public by the Board or any member of the Board
or its staff unless the parties agree thereto in writing.
   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not
constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated. Consent
agreements shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its chairman.
   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Board or Ohio Civil Rights Commission in any investigation under
this chapter.
   (e)    If the executive secretary determines that the complaint lacks
reasonable grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so
inform the Board and the Board may in his discretion dismiss such complaint or
order such further investigation as may be necessary; provided, that the Board
shall not dismiss such complaint without first affording the complainant an
opportunity to appear before the Board.
   (f)    If the executive secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a
violation of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties
have in good faith, attempted such conciliation, fails to effect an informal
conciliation agreement or a formal consent agreement or determines that a
complaint is not susceptible of conciliation, he shall notify the board
immediately and the Board shall thereafter schedule a public hearing to
determine whether a violation of this chapter has been committed. The Board
shall serve upon the respondent a statement of charges and a summons and shall
serve upon all interested parties a notice of the time and place of hearing.
The respondent or his authorized counsel may file such statements with the
Board prior to the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its
position. The hearing shall be opened to the public, except that the respondent
may request in writing a private hearing; the determination of such request
shall be discretionary with the Board. The hearing shall be held not less than
fifteen days after service of the statement of charges and summons. The summons
so issued must be signed by two members of the Board and the issuance of such
summons shall require the attendance of named persons and the production of
relevant documents and records. The failure to comply with a summons shall
constitute a violation of this chapter. The interested parties may, at their
option appear before the Board in person or by duly authorized representative
and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may present testimony
and evidence, and the right to cross examine witnesses shall be preserved. All
testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation. The
executive secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing which record shall
be public and open to inspection by any person, and upon request by any
principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such party a copy of
the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has
violated this chapter, the Board shall, after consultation with the Law
Director in executive session, state its findings to and cause the Law Director
to prepare and issue an order under Board directive requiring the person
complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to take
such affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter, with
notice that if the Board determines that the person complained against has not
after fifteen calendar days following service of the Board's order, complied
with the order, the Board will recertify the matter to the Law Director for
enforcement.
   (h)    Upon recertification to the Law Director for enforcement, he shall
seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Fair
Housing Board of the City before a court of competent jurisdiction. In any such
proceeding, where the court determines that there has been a violation of this
chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages and, where appropriate,
punitive damages, along with attorney fees. The court may also order such other
relief as it deems necessary or appropriate.
   (i)   If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon the
preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained against
has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and publish its findings
and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

indemnifying the applicant in such amounts as provided by ordinance of Council.
The policy shall further contain a clause obligating the surety company to give
ten-days' written notice to the Director of Public Safety before cancellation
of the policy, the license to expire upon the lapse or termination of the
policy of insurance.
   Such policy of insurance shall contain a provision for a continuing
liability thereunder to the full amount thereof, notwithstanding any recovery
thereon. If at any time in the judgment of the Director such policy is not
sufficient for any cause the Director may require the owner of such taxicab to
replace such policy with another approved by the Director and the Director of
Law. (Ord. 5-80. Passed 2-5-80.)
   The following minimum amounts of liability insurance coverage are hereby

business or purpose, shall not be issued again and licenses revoked because of
the condition and appearance of the vehicle shall not be reissued until the
vehicle and its appearance shall be put in fit condition for use by the public.
   (b)    The Director of Public Safety, upon his own initiative, may institute
proceedings for the revocation or suspension of any certificate of public

convenience and necessity is no longer being adequately and appropriately
served by the holder of any such certificate. Such revocation or suspension
proceedings shall be in the form of a public hearing, the time and place for
which shall be fixed by the Director and notice of which shall be given to the
holder of the certificate in question. Due notice shall also be given the
general public by posting a notice of such hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation in the City. Any interested person may file with the Director a
memorandum in support of or in opposition to the revocation or suspension of
such certificate. If it is the opinion of the Director, taking into
consideration those factors provided in Section
749.06, to be considered for the issuance of such certificate, and after
conducting such hearing as herein provided, that the public convenience and
necessity is no longer being adequately served, the Director shall take such
action as he deems appropriate under the circumstances, in the form of
revocation or suspension of the certificate in question. Such determination by
the Director shall be made within ten days following such hearing and shall be
effective immediately upon written notice thereof being given to the holder, or
his agent, of such certificate, such notice to be given either personally to

publication of such notice, in a newspaper of general circulation in the City.
Upon notice of revocation or suspension being given, in accordance herewith, no
person shall operate or permit a taxicab owned or controlled by him to be
operated as a vehicle for hire upon the streets of the City, without
reobtaining, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, a certificate
of public convenience and necessity, in the event of revocation, or unless the

      (1)   A church;
      (2)    Property of a public or private elementary or secondary school;
which is utilized for school or school-related purposes;
      (3)    A boundary of a state or federally recognized historic district;

      (5)    Within 150 feet of the property line of a lot devoted to

Chapter.
   (b)    A person commits an offense if he causes or permits the operation,

a sexually oriented business within 1000 feet of another sexually oriented
business. A person commits an offense if he causes or permits the operation,
establishment, or maintenance of more than one sexually oriented business in
the same building, structure, or portion thereof, or the increase of floor area

where a sexually oriented business is conducted, to the nearest property line
of the premises of a church or the property of a public or private elementary
or secondary school which is utilized for school or school-related purposes, or
to the nearest boundary of an affected public park, residential district, or
residential lot.

hereof shall be deemed a nonconforming use. The nonconforming use will be
permitted to continue for a period not to exceed five years, unless sooner
terminated for any reason or voluntarily discontinued for a period of 30 days
of more. Such nonconforming uses shall not be increased, enlarged, extended or
altered except that the use may be changed to a conforming use. If two or more
sexually oriented businesses are within 500 feet of one another and otherwise
in a permissible location, the sexually oriented business which was first
established and continually operating at a particular location is the
conforming use and the later-established business(es) is nonconforming.
   (f)    A sexually oriented business lawfully operating as a conforming use
is not rendered a nonconforming use by the location, subsequent to the grant or
renewal of the sexually oriented business license, of a church, property of a
public or private elementary or secondary school which is utilized for school
or school-related purposes, or public park within 500 feet of the sexually
oriented business, or the location of a residential district or residential lot
within 150 feet of the sexually oriented business. This provision applies only

the establishment is an adult motel as that term is defined in this Chapter.
   (b)    A person commits an offense if, as the person in control of a
sleeping room in a hotel, motel or similar commercial establishment that does
not have a sexually oriented business license, he rents or subrents a sleeping

direction shall be made only with properly curved pipe and fittings, and there
shall be accessible cleanouts, as specified by the Inspector, at any change of
direction of more then forty-five (45) degrees.
      (7)    Excavation. All excavations for sewers shall be open trench work,
unless otherwise approved by the Inspector.
      (8)    Bedding. Class A bedding shall consist of a continuous concrete
space cradle, installed at the location shown on the plans or as directed by
the Engineer. Concrete shall conform to Item 499-Concrete. Class B bedding
shall consist of a bed of approved granular material, passing a 3/4 inch (2 cm)
sieve from four (4) inches (10 cm) below the bottom of the pipe and extending
up around the pipe for a depth of not less than thirty (30) percent of its
vertical outside diameter. The layer of bedding material under the pipe shall
be shaped to fit the conduit for at least ten (10) percent of the vertical
diameter of the conduit and shall have recesses shaped to receive the bell of
the bell and spigot pipe.
Class C bedding shall consist of bedding the conduit in its natural foundation
to a depth of not less than ten (10) percent of the total height. The bed shall
be shaped to fit the conduit and shall have recesses shaped to receive the
bell. All space within the width of the trench excavation shall be bedded with
the same material, as specified. Unless otherwise noted on the permit, the
bedding for sanitary sewers or any sewer under pavement shall be Class B.
Except where otherwise directed by the Engineer for special conditions, the
pipe shall be laid starting at the outlet end with the bell or groove end laid
upgrade. The lower segment of the conduit shall be in contact with the shaped
bedding throughout its full length. Suitable bell- holes shall be excavated for
the bell of each bell end pipe so that the weight of the pipe will not be
supported by the bells only. The pipe shall be fitted and matched so that when
laid in the work, they shall form a conduit with a smooth and uniform invert.
The first length of pipe laid shall be firmly anchored so as to prevent
movement. All possible care shall be used when shoving the pipe together and
all pipe ends shall be carefully cleaned before pipes are laid. Gaskets shall
be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. All no hub
pipe shall be anchored by three (3) stakes per length.
      (9)    Backfilling. Backfilling shall cover the replacing of the
excavated materials after the sewer and other structures have been built and
the proper grading and shaping of the surface of the backfill. No backfill
shall be placed over completed sewer and structures until they have been
inspected and approved. Sewers shall be backfilled immediately after they have
been inspected and approved.
All sewers shall be initially backfilled evenly on both sides of the pipe and
to a minimum depth of one (1) foot (30 cm) above the pipe for the full width of
the trench with the same material used for bedding placed in layers and tamped.
In placing and tamping the initial backfill around the sewer, care shall be
taken not to disturb the line and grade of the pipe. Stepping on or working
over sewers shall be held to an absolute minimum until they have been covered
with the initial backfill. In areas of existing or future pavement, the
granular backfill shall be extended to the surface.
      (10)    Testing of new sanitary sewers. All new sanitary sewers shall be
constructed in a watertight manner and shall be tested in accordance with the
City of Ashland Standard Specifications. The inspector may waive the test on
laterals if he is confident that it is unnecessary.
         (Ord. 69-93. Passed 12-21-93.)
      (11)    Separate lateral required. A separate lateral and independent
sanitary sewer lateral shall be provided for every building, except where one
building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer
is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining
alley, court, yard, or driveway; then the lateral from the front building may
be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one lateral. In
multiple dwellings of three (3) or more units, a minimum six (6) inch (15 cm)
main lateral with a manhole or other suitable cleanout at the end and at
intervals not exceeding four hundred (400) feet (122 m) shall be required. Each
dwelling unit shall be tied into this main lateral with a four (4) inch (10 cm)
line in a manner approved by the Inspector. Each of these lines shall be
considered as a separate house lateral, and an inspection fee as required by
this chapter shall be paid. All sanitary sewer laterals constructed after
passage of the ordinance shall include a clean-out located just inside the
right-of-way line. The clean-out shall comply with the City of Ashland Standard
Drawings and Specifications.
         (Ord. 51-01. Passed 6-5-01.)
      (12)    Connection to public sanitary sewer. The connection of the
lateral into the public sanitary sewer shall be made at a manhole or "Y"
branch, if it is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is less
than four (4) inches (10 cm) larger in diameter than the lateral and no
properly located branch is available, a "Y" branch shall be installed in the
public sewer at the property owner's expense at the location approved by the
Inspector. Where the public sewer is at least four (4) inches (10 cm) larger in
diameter than the lateral and no properly located "Y" branch is available, a
neat hole may be cut into the public sewer and an approved saddle installed to
receive the lateral, with entry angled toward the direction of flow. A smooth,
neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by
encasement in concrete, or as otherwise approved. The invert of the lateral at
the point of connection shall be at an elevation of at least one-half (1/2) the
pipe diameter of the public sewer above the invert of such public sewer.
      (13)    Connection to existing sanitary sewer lateral. Whenever a new
connection is to be made to an already existing lateral, the person making the
connection shall cause such lateral to be thoroughly cleaned. The existing
lateral shall be inspected and approved by the Inspector before use.
         (Ord. 69-93. Passed 12-21-93.)
      (14)    Liability. All costs and expenses incident to the installation,
cleaning, maintenance and connection of any private sewer, drain or lateral
shall be borne by the property owner. The property owner shall indemnify the
City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by
the installation of such sewer, drain or lateral. Blockages which can be
cleared by standard sewer cleaning techniques and equipment are the
responsibility of the owner. When the owner of a private sewer, drain or
lateral determines that it is non-functional because of structurally damaged
pipe or severely offset joints located in the City’s right of way, it is the
owner’s responsibility to demonstrate to the City that all or part of the
problem is located in the City’s right of way. When such a problem is
confirmed, the City will repair or replace the problem pipe section in right of
way and install a clean-out normally just inside the right-of-way line. The
City will be responsible for all aspects of the rehabilitation project
including restoration of the construction area. Since frequent and/or major
blockage of a pipe is an indication of poor joints and/or collapsed sections,
and that the pipe is a probable source of clean water infiltration into the
public sanitary sewer system, if appropriate, the City may direct the owner to
rehabilitate or replace sections of the private sewer, drain or lateral at the
owner’s expense.
         (Ord. 51-01. Passed 6-5-01.)
      (15)    Supplementary specifications. The standard construction
specifications and street opening specifications of the City shall supplement
this Chapter and shall apply to all materials and workmanship.
      (16)    Lawn grading. All lawn grading shall be performed and maintained
in such a way as to prevent surface water from entering the foundation tile or
sanitary sewer system. (Ord. 69-93. Passed 12-21-93.)

inspection, observation, measurement, sampling and testing in accordance with
the provisions of this Chapter. Additionally, the Chief, I.P.P. shall have
access to any and all records he deems necessary and be permitted to make
copies of said records.
921.32 MONITORING PROVISIONS.
   Control Manhole. Each industrial user, as defined in Section
921.01 shall construct and maintain, at its own expense a control manhole to
allow inspection, sampling and flow measurements of wastes in the building
sewer.
   The control manhole may be either an opening to the sewer inside a structure
or a manhole. It shall be constructed on the user's premises; however, if the
location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the user, the City may
allow construction in a public right-of-way. Ample room shall be provided to
allow for safer sampling. The manhole shall be constructed in accordance with
the Engineer's requirements and meet all local construction standards and
specifications. Unless a time extension is granted, the construction of the
manhole shall be completed within ninety (90) calendar days after written
notice from the Chief, I.P.P.
   The personnel of the City shall have access to this monitoring facility at
all times for inspection and sample collection. If the facility is locked,
special arrangements shall be made to allow access. The City personnel shall
have the right to set up monitoring devices on the premises. If the industrial
user employs a security system which would require proper identification and
clearance before entry to the premises, the user shall make necessary
arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable
identification, City personnel shall be permitted entry without delay to
perform their specific responsibilities.
921.33 NOTIFICATION OF SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE.
   All industrial users shall promptly notify the Chief, I.P.P., in advance of
any substantial changes in the volume or character of pollutants in their
discharge, including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which
the Industrial User has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p).
In no case shall this notification be later than when the changed discharge
occurs. Industrial dischargers need only notify the Chief, I.P.P. of
"substantial changes" in volume and character. A substantial change would be
based on the magnitude of change to the usual discharge and not the anticipated
effect of the changed discharge on the POTW.
921.34 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   All information and data contained in a user's reports, questionnaire,
applications, monitoring programs and inspections shall be available to the
general public or any governmental agency without restriction unless the user
specifically requests and demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Chief, I.P.P.
that the release of this information would divulge information, processes or
methods which would be detrimental to his/her competitive position. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics shall not be considered confidential
information.
921.35 SIGNATORY REQUIREMENTS.
   All reports shall be signed:
   (a)    "By a responsible corporate officer," (president, secretary,
treasurer, or vice president) of the corporation;
   (b)    By a general partner or proprietor of a partnership or sole
proprietorship respectively;
   (c)    By a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in
paragraph (a) or (b) if the authorization is made in writing by the described
individual to the City of Ashland's I.P.P., and the authorized individual has
responsibility for overall operation of the facility from which the discharge
originates or;
   (d)    If previous authorization is no longer accurate because a different
individual or position is responsible for overall operation of the facility, in
which case new authorization must be submitted to the City of Ashland's I.P.P.
prior to any reports being signed by an authorized representative.
921.36 RECORDS RETENTION.
   All persons subject to this Chapter shall retain and preserve, for no less
than five (5) years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports,
correspondence and any and all summaries thereof relating to monitoring,
sampling chemical analyses made by or on his/her behalf in connection with this
discharge.
921.37 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMITS.
   (a)    Permit Required. All industrial dischargers proposing to connect to
or to discharge sewage, industrial wastes and other wastes to the City's
wastewater facilities shall be subject to the requirement of a Wastewater
Discharge Permit before connecting to or discharging to the City's wastewater
facilities. All existing Industrial Dischargers connecting to or discharging to
the City shall be subject to the requirement of a Wastewater Discharge Permit.
   The City shall determine which industrial dischargers shall be required to
obtain a Wastewater Discharge Permit. The potential or existing Discharger
shall be notified in writing by the Director to submit a Permit Application, if
the City determines through discussions, questionnaires, existing analytical
data or other reasonable means that the Industrial Discharger will or
potentially may be required to have a Wastewater Discharge permit. The
Discharger shall provide all information requested including a wastewater
analyses if required by the City to evaluate the need for a permit. The City
shall determine when a permit is required based on the Industrial Discharger's
potential impact on the sewerage system, wastewater treatment plant operations,
solids residuals and the receiving stream. Factors considered shall include but
not be limited to:
      (1)    Industry is subject to EPA Categorical Standards or other Federal
or State laws.
      (2)    Industry uses materials or compounds which are regulated, toxic or
a problem at the Wastewater Treatment Plant or discharges them in concentration
levels above "background" levels (i.e. concentration levels found in typical
average wastewater discharges by non-industrial sources.)
      (3)    Industry discharges or has the potential to discharge conventional
pollutants in amounts which may upset the Wastewater Treatment Plant,
      (4)    Industry discharges wastewater which is a significant portion of
Wastewater Treatment Plant flow.
   Those industries required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall file
a Permit application within ninety (90) days of written notice by the City's
I.P.P.
   Generally, dischargers which are a single facility location of a single
company or management but have more than one connection at the facility to the
sewerage system will be required to consolidate the discharges into a single
discharge point or obtain a permit for each discharge point unless:
      (1)    Means such as flow metering are provided to properly composite
samples on separate discharges;
      (2)    Discharges are shown not to contain pollutants above background
levels; or
      (3)    Other arrangements or monitoring approaches are used which provide
the same level of surveillance and reliability of a single combined discharge
and are approved by the Inspector.
   Where multiple discharge permits are required, each permit shall be
considered individually with regard to the establishment of discharge limits,
monitoring frequency and other conditions and requirements of the permit.
   (b)    Permit Application.  Industrial Dischargers required to submit a
Permit Application shall complete and file with the City an application in the
form prescribed by the Director and accompanied by the Permit Fee specified in
Section
921.75 (c). Proposed new Dischargers shall apply at least ninety (90) days
prior to anticipated connection to the wastewater system. No discharge permit
shall be issued unless and until the Disclosure Requirements contained in
Section
921.30  have been met.
   (c)    Permit Application Review. The Director will evaluate the complete
application and data furnished by the Discharger and may require additional
information. Within thirty (30) days after full evaluation and acceptance of
the data furnished, the Authority shall issue a Wastewater Discharge Permit
subject to terms and conditions provided herein.
   (d)    Permit Modification. The City reserves the right to amend any
Wastewater Permit issued hereunder in order to assure compliance by the
Authority with applicable laws and regulations. Within nine (9) months of the
promulgation of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the Wastewater
Discharge Permit of each Discharger subject to such standard shall be revised
to require compliance with such standards within the time frame prescribed by
such standards. All National Categorical Pretreatment Standards adopted after
the promulgation of this chapter shall be adopted by the City as part of this
chapter. Where a Discharger, subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard, has not previously submitted an application for a Wastewater
Discharge Permit as required by Section
921.37 (a), the Discharger shall apply for a Wastewater Discharge Permit from
the Authority within 180 days after the promulgation of the Applicable National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
In addition, the Discharger with an existing Wastewater Discharge Permit shall
submit to the Authority within 180 days after the promulgation of an applicable
National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the information required by Section
921.30 (a)(8) and (9). The Discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes
in his permit at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of change.
Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time
schedule for compliance.
   (e)    Permit Conditions. Wastewater Discharge Permits shall specify no less
than the following:
      (1)    Fees and charges to be paid upon initial permit issuance;
      (2)    Limits on the wastewater constituents and characteristics
regulated thereby;
      (3)    Limits on rate and time of discharge and/or requirements for flow
regulations and equalization;
      (4)    Requirements for installation and maintenance of special
inspection and sampling facilities where same differ from the requirements of
Section
921.32 ;
      (5)    Special conditions as the Director may reasonably require under
particular circumstances of a given discharge including sampling locations,
frequency of sampling, number, types, and standards for tests and reporting
schedule;
      (6)    Compliance schedules;
      (7)    Requirements for submission of special technical reports or
discharge reports where same differ from those prescribed by this chapter.
   (f)   Permits Duration. All Wastewater Discharge Permits shall be issued for
a period not to exceed five (5) years, subject to amendment or revocation as
provided in this chapter. Under extraordinary circumstances, a permit may be
issued for a period shorter than five (5) years.
   (g)    Wastewater Discharge Permit Reissuance. A user with an expiring
Wastewater Discharge Permit shall apply for wastewater discharge permit
reissuance by submitting a complete permit application, in accordance with
Section
921.37 (b), a minimum of ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the user's
existing wastewater discharge permit.
   (h)    Limitation on Permit Transfer. Wastewater Discharge Permits are
issued to a specific Discharger for a specific operation and are not assignable
to another Discharger without the prior written approval of the Director, or
transferable to any other location.
   (i)    Permit Application Fee.  All Wastewater Discharge Permit Applications
shall be accompanied by a non-refundable permit fee as specified in Section 
921.75 (c).
921.38 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT LIMITS.
   Pollutant discharge concentration or mass limits shall be established where
deemed appropriate by the Director for inclusion in the Wastewater Discharge
Permit. The limits shall normally apply to the combined total discharge of
polluted wastewater from the facility.
   (a)    Combined Wastestream Formula. Non-contact cooling water, roof drains
or other polluted wastewaters prohibited elsewhere by this sewer use chapter
may not be included in wastewater pollutant concentration determination. In the
presence of such flows the City may employ the use of combined wastestream
formulas to determine actual pollutant strengths or alternate limits.
Calculation methods which result in limits below analytical detection limits of
the pollutant parameters shall dictate that such unpolluted flows must be
eliminated or otherwise separated from wastestreams containing regulated
pollutants.
   (b)    Water Use Discharge Limitation. Water use discharge limits may be
included in the Wastewater Discharge Permit for the purpose of establishing
maximum pollutant loadings discharged by an Industrial User.
      (1)    The water use for an Industrial User as it applies to permitted
discharge shall be equal to the water consumption as recorded on the Industrial
User's water and sewer use billing plus water from any other source such as
private wells which is discharged to the Public Sewer except as herein
provided. The Industrial User shall be responsible for metering private
supplies.
      (2)    The permitted wastewater discharge may be established by the City
based on the elimination of non-polluted or non-discharged waters from the
calculations.
      (3)    Where the permitted discharge is less than that in Section
921.38 (b), (1) above, the Industrial User shall be required to provide
satisfactory information to the City that the actual discharge is less than
water consumption by one of the following methods:
         A.   Provide flow metering devices approvable by the Chief, IPP on all
discharge points under permit;
         B.   Provide separate metering for any discharges which are not
included in the permitted wastestream; or,
         C.    Provide other proof satisfactory to the Chief, IPP of the
quantity of non-discharged water to be subtracted from the metered water
supplied by the City, in calculating the permitted discharge flow.
      (4)    Other verifiable and reliable method agreed upon by the City.
      (5)    Since the wastewater discharge limit in the permit is established
to control maximum pollutant discharge loading and is not meant to control or
discourage the use of water, the City shall have the authority to waive
violations of water use discharge limits provided that actual pollutant loading
as determined by the permitted concentration and permitted wastewater discharge
is not exceeded and that the excess flow is not otherwise prohibited or
objectionable.
   (c)    Self Monitoring. The Industrial User shall perform routine sampling
and analysis of the discharge covered by the Wastewater Discharge Permit
whenever such activities are required in the provisions of the Permit ordered
by the Director. The sampling and analysis shall be performed in compliance
with the methods approved in 40 CFR, Part 136, Sampling and Laboratory
Analysis.
Where self-monitoring requirements have been imposed on an industrial user, a
Special Monitoring Agreement may be offered to that industry where the City
assumes the responsibility for collection, preparation/preservation and
transportation of samples to a contract lab (where applicable). Results of
these analyses will be reported from the lab to both the industrial user and
the City. Specific conditions of such an Agreement will be determined by the
Chief, I.P.P. The City reserves the right to deny such an Agreement where it
determines such an agreement would not be in its best interest.
Where sampling performed by an Industrial User indicates a violation, the user
shall notify the City of Ashland's Chief; Industrial Pretreatment within 24
hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the City
of Ashland's Chief, I.P.P., within 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation. Additional monitoring above and beyond that required in an IU's
permit is acceptable; however, compliance reports must include the results of
all analyses performed as specified in 40 CFR 403.12(e).
921.39 EXTENSION OF SANITARY SEWER SERVICE.
   (a)   No sanitary sewer service shall be extended to any sanitary sewer
users outside the corporate limits of the City except under the conditions set
forth hereafter: the City may extend sanitary sewer service to land which is
outside of the corporate limits of the City but within the City's sanitary
sewer service area provided that before such sanitary sewer service is
extended, the owner of such land must comply with the following:
Execute an agreement to annex the property to the City or a petition for
annexation to the City, as determined by the City. Such owner shall exert all
efforts to obtain annexation of the owner's property, including, if requested
by the City, signing an annexation petition. In the case of an agreement to
annex to the City, the owner of such land must also agree to require a similar
agreement from any party to whom the owner sells all or any part of the owner's
land.
   (b)   It is further provided that any person or entity presently receiving
sanitary sewer service from the City shall, upon notice from the City,
immediately comply with the provisions set forth herein, above. Failure to
comply with such policy shall result in the sanitary sewer service being
terminated 60 days from the date of notice. (Ord. 65-07. Passed 9-18-07.)
921.40 - 921.69 RESERVED.
FEES
921.70 ADJUSTMENTS FOR LEAKS AND DISAPPROVAL.
   The Director is hereby authorized to make such rules and regulations as are
necessary for the equitable application of the sewer service charges. Further,
the Director may make adjustments in such charges for leaks or other causes
which, in his judgment, are adequately substantiated by known circumstances,
evidence or Water Division records, where such charges would otherwise impose
an unwarranted and unfair cost to the user brought about by circumstances
beyond his control. A record of any and all such adjustments shall be
maintained in the office of the Director and a copy of the same shall be filed
with the Director of Water Distribution and Accounting office.
921.71 PORTION OF METERED WATER NOT ENTERING SEWER SYSTEM.
   In the event that the Director of Water Distribution and Accounting or his
agent shall be satisfied that a portion of the water consumed upon any premise
is not accurately reflected by the main service meter, then the owner and/or
other interested party may at their expense, install and maintain such separate
metering devices as shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of said Director,
what portion of this metered water is actually discharged to the sanitary
sewer. Such portion shall be the basis for measuring the flows and loads under
this provision. Each meter shall constitute a separate service for billing
purposes.
921.72 SURCHARGE.
   All persons discharging approved wastewater into the public sanitary sewers
as determined under the provisions of this Chapter shall be subject to
surcharges as set forth in Ashland City Sections
923.05 and
923.06, determined monthly solely on the basis of the following formula:
   P = (A) x BOD + (B) x SS
   Where:
   P =       monthly surcharge
BOD =    pounds of biochemical oxygen demand per month in excess of the
specified user class mg/1 concentration in the wastewater.
    SS =       pounds of suspended solids per month in excess of the specified
user class mg/1 concentration in the wastewater.
   In the above formula, A and B refer to the total expenditures per pound of
BOD and suspended solids, respectively, to collect, convey and treat the
wastewater. This information shall be supplied by the Engineer or Director.
921.73 CHARGE FOR ACCEPTING HOLDING TANK WASTES.
   A fee of twenty ($20.00) dollars shall be paid for each one thousand (1000)
gallons (3800 L) of such waste accepted.
921.74 CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH SEWER CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)    Sewer Installer License. All connections to a public sanitary sewer
shall be made by a licensed sewer installer. Upon successful completion of the
sewer installer's test and upon receipt of the fifteen dollar ($15.00) fee, a
license shall be issued. The sewer installer's license shall be renewed yearly
upon receipt of the seven dollar and fifty cent ($7.50) fee. Failure to renew
the sewer installer's license within a calendar year may be cause for
retesting. The sewer installer's license may be revoked for failure to comply
with this chapter and/or City specifications.
   (b)    Inspection Fee. There shall be an inspection fee in the amount of
twenty-five ($25.00) for the services rendered by the Inspector in inspecting
the installation of any sewer, drain or lateral or the connection thereto. If
the installation of the connection does not conform to the application filed
and the ordinances of the City, there shall be an additional fee of ten dollars
($10.00) for each trip the Inspector has to make before approval is granted.
   (c)    Sanitary Sewer Tap Fee. Any person tapping into a sanitary sewer line
shall pay a tap fee. For the purpose of this section, a "sanitary sewer line"
shall mean a line that has been constructed by the City and for which no
assessments have been levied against the property in question.
      Tap fee shall be as follows:
 
4 (10 cm) inch diameter tap -  $500.00
6 (15 cm) inch diameter tap -  $1,150.00
8 (20 cm) inch diameter tap -  $2,500.00

12 (30 cm) inch diameter tap - $7,000.00
 
   The tap fee shall be waived for premises previously participating in the
cost of the construction of that sewer.
921.75 CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH PRETREATMENT.
   (a)    Sampling Event Charge. A sampling event charge shall be made to
compensate the City for pretreatment inspections and program administration
expenses as specified in Chapter
923, Sewer Charges. This charge shall be made for each event as defined in
Section
921.01 (53). The Chief, I.P.P. reserves the authority to prorate this charge at
a rate schedule considered appropriate.
   (b)    Compensation for Cost of Sample Analysis. The City shall be
compensated for all expenses associated with the analysis of industrial waste
samples.
   (c)    Wastewater Discharge Permit Application Fee. A non-refundable fee of
$25.00 will be charged with each permit application.
921.76 - 921.79 RESERVED.
ENFORCEMENT
921.80 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   The following orders may be issued by the Director upon the discovery of a
violation(s) of City, State and/or Federal environmental law:
   (a)    Notice of Violation. The service of Notice of Violation under this
Chapter shall be as follows whenever the Chief, Industrial Pretreatment finds
that any industrial user has violated or is violating this chapter, or
wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, the Director or his agent may
serve upon said user written notice of the violation. Within ten (10) days of
the receipt date of the notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for
the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted to the Chief, I.P.P. Submission of this
plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring
before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation.
The notice shall be personally served or sent by registered mail to the
property owner by the Chief, I.P.P., or authorized representative. When, after
reasonable search, the property owner cannot be found or reached for service of
the notice, then the notice may be published once a week for two (2)
consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the City and the
time stipulated in the notice for compliance shall date from the last
publication thereof.
   (b)    Consent Orders. The Director is hereby empowered to enter into
Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for the
noncompliance. Such orders will include specific actions to be taken by the
industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also
specified by the order. Consent Orders shall have the same force and effect as
administrative orders issued pursuant to section below.
   (c)    Show Cause Hearing. The Director may serve any user with a written
notice specifying the time and place of hearing to be held by the Director or
his designated representative, regarding violation of Section
921.86 . The notice shall include the reasons why an enforcement action is to
be taken and shall direct the user to show cause why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of hearing shall be served not less than
fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing and may be served on any agent, officer
or authorized representative of the user.
   (d)    Compliance Order. When the Director finds that an industrial user has
violated or continues to violate the chapter or a permit or order issued
thereunder, he may issue an order to the Industrial User responsible for the
discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service
shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other
related appurtenances have been installed and are properly operated. Orders may
also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of
pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices.
   (e)    Cease and Desist Orders. When the Director finds that an industrial
user has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or order
issued hereunder, the Director may issue an order to cease and desist all such
violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:
      (1)    Comply forthwith.
      (2)    Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and terminating the discharge.
921.81 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   Notwithstanding any other section of this chapter, any user who is found to
have violated any provision of this chapter, or permits and orders issued
hereunder, shall be fined in an amount not to exceed one thousand ($1000.00)
per violation. Each day on which noncompliance shall occur or continue shall be
deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the
user's next scheduled sewer service charge and the Director shall have such
other collection remedies as he has to collect other service charges. Unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties shall constitute a lien against the individual
user's property. Industrial Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a
request for the Director to reconsider the fine within 10 days of being
notified of the fine. Where the Director believes a request has merit, he shall
convene a hearing on the matter within fifteen (15) days of receiving the
request from the industrial user.
921.82 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES.
   (a)    Treatment Upset. Any industrial user which experiences an upset in
operations that places it in a temporary state of noncompliance, which is not
the result of operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation, shall inform the Chief, I.P.P., thereof immediately upon
becoming aware of the upset. Where such information is given orally, a written
report thereof shall be filed by the user within ten (10) days. The report
shall contain:
      (1)    A description of the upset, its cause(s), and the impact on the
discharger's compliance status,
      (2)    The duration of the noncompliance, including exact dates and times
of noncompliance and if the noncompliance is continuing, the time by which
compliance is reasonably expected to be restored,
      (3)    All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of such an upset.
   (b)    An industrial user which complies with the notification provisions of
this Section in a timely manner shall have an affirmative defense to any
enforcement action brought by the Director for any noncompliance with this
chapter, or an order or permit issued hereunder by the user, which arises out
of violations attributable to and alleged to have occurred during the period of
the documented and verified upset.
   (c)    Treatment Bypasses. A bypass of the treatment system is prohibited
unless all of the following conditions are met:
      (1)    The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
      (2)    There was no feasible alternative to the bypass, including the use
of auxiliary treatment or retention of the wastewater; and
      (3)    The industrial user properly notified the Chief, I.P.P., as
described in paragraph (d) below.
   (d)    Industrial users must provide immediate notice to the Chief, I.P.P.,
upon discovery of an unanticipated bypass. If necessary, the Chief, I.P.P., may
require the industrial user to submit a written report explaining the cause(s),
nature, and duration of the bypass, and the steps
being taken to prevent its recurrence.
   (e)    An industrial user may allow a bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards to be violated, but only if it is for essential
maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system. Industrial
Users anticipating a bypass must submit notice to the Chief, I.P.P., at least
ten (10) days in advance. The Chief, I.P.P., may only approve the anticipated
bypass if the circumstances satisfy those set forth in paragraph (c) above.
921.83 COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE.
   Where additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance activities
will be required to comply with this chapter, the Dischargers shall provide a
declaration of the shortest schedule by which the Discharger will provide such
additional pretreatment and/or implementation of additional operational and
maintenance activities. The schedule shall contain milestone dates for the
commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and
operation of additional pretreatment requirements of this chapter including,
but not limited to dates relating to hiring an engineer, hiring other
appropriate personnel, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans,
executing a contract for major components, commencing construction, completing
construction and all other acts necessary to achieve compliance with this
chapter.
   Under no circumstances shall the Director permit a time increment for any
single step directed toward compliance which exceeds nine (9) months.
   Not later than fourteen (14) days following each milestone date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the Discharger shall submit a
progress report to the Director, including no less than a statement as to
whether or not it complied with the increment of progress represented by that
milestone date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this
increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the
Discharger to return the construction to the approved schedule.
   In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress
reports to the Director.
921.84 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   The Director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater
permit of an industrial user whenever such suspension is necessary in order to
stop an actual or threatened discharge presenting or causing an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, the POTW, or the
environment.
   (a)    Any user notified of a suspension of wastewater treatment service
and/or their wastewater permit shall immediately stop or eliminate
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director shall take such steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream or endangerment to
any individuals. The Director shall allow the user to recommence discharge when
the endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings set forth in
Section
921.86  are initiated against the user.
   (b)    An industrial user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for
imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence to the Director prior to the date of any show cause hearing
described in Section
921.80 (c) of this chapter.
   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section.

923.06 ADDITIONAL CHARGES.
   (a)   In addition to the extra charges for excess BOD and SS, the City may
levy an extra charge upon any user for the discharge of any other pollutant
into the sanitary sewerage system or for any other reason that it deems
necessary and appropriate and which discharge or pollutant or other reason
results in additional costs not covered by the rates and charges established
hereby.
   (b)   In addition to the sewer charges levied pursuant to this chapter and
revisions thereof, the City may levy a surcharge in accordance with Section
921.72 and revisions thereof.
   (c)   Effective January 1, 1993, the following charges shall be levied to
fund the industrial pretreatment programs:
   Facilities whose wastes are monitored and/or required to be monitored shall
pay to the City a fee of sixty dollars ($60.00) for each sampling event (as
defined below) and in addition shall reimburse the City for the actual cost of
testing the samples by an independent outside laboratory (other than the City
laboratory). The City may pay a portion of this testing cost in accordance with
guidelines developed by the Director of Wastewater Facilities and approved by
the Mayor.
   “Sampling Event”, for the purpose of this chapter means a visit to the
facility for the purpose of obtaining a wastewater sample, including, if
necessary, the installation of temporary sampling devices, flow meters, etc.

   The charge for all unmetered private wells shall be one hundred forty
dollars ($140.00) per year, payable monthly. If a meter is installed measuring
the actual water discharged into the sanitary sewer, the rates shall be the
same as those set forth in this chapter for other property owners. (Ord. 54-92.
Passed 10-6-92.)
923.08 PRIVATE WATER SUPPLY.
   Where there is a private source of water supply, the Director of Public
Service may require the sewer owner, at the owner's expense to meter the water
used, or the Director may accept the statement from the supplier of the water
to the sewer owner, of the monthly flow or the amount of flow guaranteed by
such water supplier and the charges made by the City to such property owner
shall be calculated upon the same basis as if the water had been supplied
through the City mains. (Ord. 54-92. Passed 10-6-92.)
923.09 UNPAID BILLS.
   If a sewer bill is not paid within fifteen days after the date of mailing, a
ten percent (10%) penalty shall be added.
   Since the foregoing rates are based on water consumption, the City will not
accept payment of any water bill without payment also of the sewer bill, and if
any bill remains unpaid for thirty days, the City may cut off the water supply
to such sewer owner until the sewer bill is paid.
(Ord. 54-92. Passed 10-6-92.)
923.10 LIABILITY OF OWNER.
   The owner of private property which is served by the sewerage system by
pipes connected with the system to convey sewage away, as well as the lessee of
the premises, is liable to the City for all service of the system rendered such
premises.
(Ord. 54-92. Passed 10-6-92.)
923.11 BILLS PAYABLE.
   All charges of sewer and sewage disposal service shall become due and

delinquent charges shall be certified to the County Auditor to be collected in
the same manner as other City taxes, under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 729.49.
   Sewer rental charges shall be payable at the office of the Water Division in
the Municipal Building. (Ord. 54-92. Passed 10-6-92.)

supply from sources other than the City's water mains, shall report such fact
to the Director of Public Service by filling out forms to be supplied by him
for such purpose. Failure to file such report shall subject such user to a
penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each month or fraction thereof after such
date during which such report is not made.
(Ord. 54-92. Passed 10-6-92.)
923.13 SERVICES OUTSIDE CORPORATION LIMITS.
   A fifty percent (50%) additional charge shall be added to all sewer charges
for services outside the Ashland corporation limits.
(Ord. 54-92. Passed 10-6-92.)
923.14 TURN-ON FEE AFTER TEMPORARY TURN-OFF.
   In the case of temporary suspension of water services, as requested by the
user, there shall be a ten dollar ($10.00) "turn-on" fee to return the user to

which storm water is discharged, and the City demonstrates probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this regulation, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of an inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this regulation or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, the City may
seek issuance of a search warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to
injunctive relief, and/or criminal remedies from any court of appropriate
jurisdiction.
      (7)   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator. (Ord. 22-18. Passed 4-3-18.)
935.09 ENFORCEMENT.

Building Appeals to determine reasons for non-compliance and to determine the
next enforcement activity. Notice of the administrative hearing shall be hand
delivered and/or sent registered mail.
   (e)   Injunctive Relief: It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
regulation pursuant to O.R.C. 3709.211. If an owner/operator has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this regulation, the City may petition
for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the owner/operator from
activities that would create further violations or compelling the owner/
operator to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.

(Ord. 47-18. Passed 7-17-18.)
937.03 GENERAL DEFINITIONS.
   General definitions as used in this chapter are as follows:
   (a)   "Antenna" means any apparatus designed for the purpose of the
transmission and/or reception of radio frequency ("RF") radiation, to be
operated or operating from a fixed location to facilitate wireless
communications services including but not limited to the transmission of
writings, signs, signals, data, images, pictures, and sounds of all kinds.
   (b)    "Applicant" means any person that submits an application to the City
to site, install, construct, collocate, modify, and/or operate a Wireless
Communications Facility in the right of way.
   (c)    "Base Station" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. §
1.40001(b)(1), as may be amended and interpreted by the FCC and any other
authority with competent jurisdiction, which defines that term as follows:
      (1)    A structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables FCC-
licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a
communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as defined in 47
C.F.R.§ 1.40001(b)(9) or any equipment associated with a tower.
         A.    The term includes, but is not limited to, equipment associated
with wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and public
safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless
services such as microwave backhaul.
         B.    The term includes, but is not limited to, radio transceivers,
antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and
comparable equipment, regardless of technological configuration (including
Distributed Antenna Systems and small-cell networks).
         C.    The term includes any structure other than a tower that, at the
time the relevant application is filed with the State or local government under
this section [of 47 C.F.R.], supports or houses equipment described in
paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (ii) of this section [of 47 C.F.R.] that has been
reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under
another State or local regulatory review process, even if the structure was not
built for the sole or primary purpose of providing such support.
         D.    The term does not include any structure that, at the time the
relevant application is filed with the State or local government under this
section [of 47 C.F.R.], does not support or house equipment described in
paragraphs (b)(1)(i)-(ii) of this section [of 47 C.F .R.].
      (2)    As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC's definition
refers to any structure that actually supports wireless equipment even though
it was not originally intended for that purpose. Examples include, but are not
limited to, wireless facilities mounted on utility poles and other structures
in the right of way, light standards, or traffic signals when such structure is
approved by the City as an appropriate support for wireless transmission
equipment. An existing structure without wireless transmission equipment that
is replaced with a new one designed to bear the additional weight from wireless
transmission equipment constitutes a base station.
   (d)    "Collocation" means the mounting or installation of a wireless
communications facility, antenna, and/or transmission equipment on an existing
eligible support structure or potential support structure for the purpose of
transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communications
purposes, as more specifically defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001 (b)
(2), as may be amended or superseded.
   (e)    "Design Standards" means those detailed design, construction, and
installation guidelines and examples promulgated by the City of Ashland's
Engineering Division for the design, construction, and installation of
structures supporting wireless communications facilities in the right of way,
which are effective insofar as they do not conflict with any federal or state
rule or regulation.
   (f)    "Eligible Facilities Request" means the same as defined by the FCC in

it is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with the State or
local government under this section [of 47 C.F.R.]."
   (h)    "Existing" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.P.R.§ 1.4000l
(b)(4), as may be amended, which provides that " [a] constructed tower or base
station is existing for purposes of [the FCC's Section 6409(a) regulations] if
it has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting
process, or under another State or local regulatory review process, provided
that a tower that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a
zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for
purposes of this definition."
   (i)    "Person" means, without limitation, a natural person, a corporation,
whether nonprofit or for profit, a partnership, a limited liability company, an
unincorporated society or association, and two or more persons having a joint
or common interest.
   (j)    "Potential Support Structure" means an existing building or
structure, other than a tower as defined in this section, that may be
transformed into a base station through the mounting or installation of an
antenna or transmission equipment after the City approves it as a support
structure and the permittee installs transmission equipment pursuant to such
approval; potential support structures include but are not limited to
buildings, steeples, water towers, utility poles, light poles, City-owned
structures in the right of way, and outdoor advertising signs.
   (k)    "Right of Way" means real property for or devoted to (1) public
transportation purposes; or (2) the placement of the city's municipal utility
easements and other traditional uses along a transportation route, whether by
dedication, prescription, or otherwise, as well as the spaces above and below.
In addition to the foregoing, the definition of right of way includes, without
limitation, public highways, streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, bridges, tree
lawns, aqueducts, and viaducts within the city.
   (1)    "Right-of-Way Permit" means a permit for any work within or occupancy
of the right-of-way, issued by the City's Engineering Division.
   (m)    "Site" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.4000l(b)
(6) as applicable to facilities in the public right-of-way and as may be
amended, which provides that "for other eligible support structures, further
restricted to that area in proximity to the structure and to other transmission
equipment already deployed on the ground."
   (n)    "Substantial change" means the same as defined by the FCC in 47
C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(7), as may be amended, and as applicable to facilities in
the public right-of-way, which defines that term as a modification that:
      (1)    Increases the overall height by more than 10% or by more than 10
feet (whichever is greater);
      (2)    Involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that
would protrude more than 6 feet from the edge of the structure;
      (3)    Involves the installation of any new equipment cabinets on the
ground if there are no existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets associated
with the structure;
      (4)    Involves the installation of any new ground-mounted equipment
cabinets that are more than ten percent (10%) larger in height or overall
volume than any existing ground-mounted equipment cabinets associated with the
structure;
      (5)    Involves excavation or deployment of equipment outside the area in
proximity to the structure and other transmission equipment already deployed on
the ground;
      (6)    Would defeat the existing concealment elements of the support
structure as determined by the Engineering Division; or
      (7)    Does not comply with conditions associated with the siting
approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure
or base station equipment, provided however that this limitation does not apply
to any modification that is non-compliant only in a manner that would not
exceed the thresholds identified in 47 C.F.R. § 1.4000l(b)(7)(i) through (iv).
For clarity, the defmition in this chapter includes only the defmition of a
substantial change as it applies to facilities within the public right-of-way.
The thresholds for a substantial change outlined above are disjunctive. The
failure to meet any one or more of the applicable thresholds means that a
substantial change would occur. The thresholds for height increases are
cumulative limits. For sites with horizontally separated deployments, the
cumulative limit is measured from the originally-permitted support structure
without regard to any increases in size due to wireless equipment not included
in the original design. For sites with vertically separated deployments, the
cumulative limit is measured from the permitted site dimensions as they existed
on February 22, 2012, the date that Congress passed Section 6409(a) of the
Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act.
   (o)    "Tower" means any structure built for the sole or primary purpose of
supporting any FCC licensed or authorized antennas and their associated
facilities, that are constructed for wireless communications services
including, but not limited to, private, broadcast, and public safety services,

or fiber-optic cable, and regular and backup power supply, as more specifically
defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(8). This definition includes
equipment in any technological configuration associated with any FCC authorized
wireless transmission, licensed or unlicensed, commercial mobile, private
mobile, fixed wireless microwave backhaul, and fixed broadband.
   (q)    "Wireless Communications Facility" means any unstaffed installation
for the transmission and/or reception of radio frequency signals for wireless
communications services, typically consisting of a tower or base station,
transmission equipment, equipment cabinets, and all materials or techniques
used to conceal the installation. This term includes (but is not limited to)
micro wireless facilities as defmed in Ohio Revised Code Section 4939.0l(F).
   (r)    "Wireless Communications Service" means any FCC-licensed or
authorized wireless communication service including, without limitation, any
personal wireless services, as defined in 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(D).

this chapter or if the applicant owes payment on outstanding invoices for costs
recoverable by the City under this chapter.
         (Ord. 47-18. Passed 7-17-18.)
937.05 APPLICATION REVIEW AND RIGHT-OF-WAY PERMIT.
   (a)    General Standard of Review for Wireless Communications Facilities.
All wireless communications facilities in the right of way shall conform to the
Design Standards. The Engineering Division shall review and consider each
application according to the application classifications, review processes, and
deployment standards described in the Design Standards.
   (b)    Written Decision. After the Engineering Division renders a decision
on an application, it shall send written notice to the applicant. Any denial
shall include the reasons for the denial and information regarding the process
for an appeal.
   (c)    Approval. Approval of an application and issuance of a Right-of-Way
Permit shall include the following permissions:
      (1)    Permission to construct. Permission to construct the approved
wireless communications facility, subject to any conditions established by the
Engineering Division to carry out the purposes and intent of this chapter.
      (2)    Right-of-Way permission. Right-of-way occupancy permission,
granting the applicant permission to occupy the right of way at the proposed
site and subject to (a) the standard conditions required by Design Standards
and Right-of-Way Permit and (b) any additional conditions required by the City
Engineer to carry out the purposes and intent of this chapter. The Right-of-Way
Permit shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in the right of way.
   (d)    Restrictions on Right-of-way Permits. A Right-of-Way Permit may be
transferred upon notification to the City and acceptance by the transferee to
allow the transferee to site wireless facilities in the same location on the
same supporting structure as the transferor. Such a transfer may be made only
to a provider who possesses a current Right-of-Way Permit from the city for
siting wireless facilities elsewhere in the right of way.
   (e)    Denial.  The city reserves the right to deny an application if any
one of the following conditions exist:
      (1)    The applicant has not demonstrated that its application conforms
to the provisions of this chapter, including the Design Standards established
pursuant to this chapter;
      (2)    The applicant is not authorized to conduct business in the State
of Ohio;
      (3)    For any application submitted as an eligible facilities request,
the applicant has failed to show that the project qualifies for approval
pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a) and the related FCC regulations at 47 C.P.R. §
1.40001 et seq. ;
      (4)    For any application for a Right-of-Way Permit not involving an
eligible facilities request, as defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001, the
applicant has failed within the prior three years to comply or is presently not
in full compliance with the requirements of this chapter with regard to another
Wireless Communications Facility that is not the subject of the application in
question;
      (5)    The applicant is in default of its obligation to pay to the city
fees imposed by this chapter;
      (6)    The design or location does not comply with the relevant standards
promulgated by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials (AASHTO) or the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) and utilized
by the Engineering Division for construction in the right of way;
      (7)    The design or location does not comply with current or proposed
Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) promulgated by
the United State Access Board.
   (f)    Appeal of Denial on the Merits. Upon denial of an application for
failure to meet the requirements of this chapter, the applicant may appeal the
decision in accordance with Ohio Revised Code Chapter 2506.
   (g)    Limited Exemption for Personal Wireless Service Facilities. Federal
law prohibits a permit denial when it would effectively prohibit the provision
of personal wireless services. Due to wide variation among wireless facilities
and technical service objectives, and due to changed circumstances over time, a
limited exemption for proposals in which strict compliance with this chapter
would effectively prohibit personal wireless services serves the public
interest. Circumstances in which an effective prohibition may occur are
extremely difficult to discern. Therefore, in the event that any applicant
asserts that strict compliance with any provision in this chapter, as applied
to a specific proposed wireless communications facility, would effectively
prohibit the provision of personal wireless services, the City Engineer may
grant a limited, one- time exemption from strict compliance, subject to the
following provisions:
      (1)    Required findings. The City Engineer shall not grant any exemption
unless the applicant provides each of the following:
         A.    Evidence that the proposed wireless facility qualifies as a
"personal wireless services facility" as defined in 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(C)
(ii);
         B.    A clearly defmed and reasonable technical service objective and
a clearly defined potential site search area; and
         C.    A meaningful comparative analysis that includes the factual
reasons why: (1) any alternative location(s) or design(s) suggested by the City
or otherwise identified in the administrative record are not technically
feasible, and (2) the proposed location and design deviation is the least
noncompliant location and design necessary to reasonably achieve the
applicant's technical service objective.
      (2)    Scope of exemption. The City Engineer shall limit the exemption to
the extent to which the applicant demonstrates such exemption is necessary to
reasonably achieve its reasonable technical service objectives. The Engineering
Division may adopt conditions of approval specific to a permit issued as a
limited exemption pursuant to this section, as reasonably necessary to promote
the purposes in this chapter and protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
         (Ord. 47-18. Passed 7-17-18.)
937.06  NONCONFORMING WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES.
   (a)    Any wireless communications facility sited in the right of way that
is legally in existence on the date of the adoption of this chapter but that
does not comply with the requirements of this chapter shall be permitted to
remain in the right of way but shall be considered a nonconforming wireless
communications facility.
   (b)    As of the effective date of the chapter establishing this chapter,
the owner of the nonconforming facility and the facility itself are subject to
the standard conditions found in this chapter and the Design Standards.
   (c)    If a nonconforming wireless communications facility is damaged or
destroyed beyond repair, any replacement facility must be designed in

deny any collocation or modification pursuant to an application filed for an
eligible facilities request, as required by FCC regulations. (Ord. 47-18.
Passed 7-17-18.)
937.07  SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of any part of this chapter are severable. If any provision
or subsection, or the application of any provision or subsection to any person
or circumstances, is held invalid, the remaining provisions, subsection, and
applications of such ordinance to other persons or circumstances shall not be
made invalid as well. It is declared to be the intent of this section that the
remaining provisions would have been adopted had such invalid provisions not
been included in this chapter when originally adopted by Council.
(Ord. 47-18. Passed 7-17-18.)
937.99 PENALTY.
   (a)    Any person who shall erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, repair,
convert, attach, or maintain any wireless communications facility in violation
of any of the terms of this chapter, or who, being the owner or agent of the
owner of any lot, tract, or parcel of land, shall suffer or permit another to
erect, construct, reconstruct, alter, repair, convert, attach, or maintain any
such
facility, shall be deemed to have violated the provisions above and shall be
fined a penalty of $750.00 for each day during the period such violation

II.    PERMIT APPLICATIONS AND PROCEDURES
   A.    General. This section describes necessary requirements for a permit
application. The Engineering Division may from time-to-time develop and publish
new or additional permit application forms, checklists, informational handouts
and other related materials. To avoid unnecessary delay in application
processing, applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the Engineering
Division before submittal to ensure that it has consulted all the most up-to-
date requirements.
   B.    Categories of Applications. In accordance with FCC regulations, the
Engineering Division shall classify every application to locate a wireless
communications facility in the right of way as one of the following three
types:
      1.    A Type I application is for a minor modification that:
         a.    involves collocation, removal or replacement of transmission
equipment on an existing tower or base station; and
         b.    does not substantially change the physical dimensions of the
existing tower or base station.
      2.    A Type II application is for a modification that:
         a.    involves collocation, removal or replacement of transmission
equipment on an existing tower or base station; and
         b.    substantially changes the physical dimensions of the existing
tower or base station or does not qualify for approval pursuant to 47 U.S.C. §
1455(a) for any lawful reason.
      3.    A Type III application is one that proposes:
         a.    siting new transmission equipment on a potential support
structure in the right of way that does not already support transmission
equipment; or
         b.    siting a new wireless communication facility on a new tower or
other support structure in the right of way.
   C.    Application Requirements.
      1.    Application Fee. The applicant shall pay the applicable permit
application fee as required by the Engineering Division's fee schedule.
      2.    RF Compliance Affidavit. Applicants shall submit a sworn affidavit
prepared and signed by an RF engineer with knowledge about the proposed project

antennas and antennas used for wireless backhaul (such as microwave dish
antenna or U/E relay).
      3.    Regulatory Authorization. To the extent that the applicant claims
any regulatory authorization or other right to use the public right-of-way, the
applicant shall provide a true and correct copy of the certificate, license,
notice to proceed or other regulatory authorization that supports the
applicant's claim.
      4.    Owner's Authorization. Applicants shall submit evidence sufficient
to show that either (1) the applicant owns the proposed support structure or
(2) the applicant has obtained the owner's authorization to file the
application.
      5.    Site Plans and Structural Calculations. The applicant shall submit
fully dimensioned site plans, elevation drawings, and structural calculations
prepared, sealed, stamped and signed by a Professional Engineer licensed and
registered by the State of Ohio. Drawings shall depict any existing wireless
facilities with all existing transmission equipment and other improvements, the
proposed facility with all proposed transmission equipment and other
improvements, and the legal boundaries of the leased or owned area surrounding
the proposed facility and any associated access or utility easements.
         a.    Photo Simulations. For all applications other than a Type I
application for a collocation or modification to an existing facility with no
concealment, the applicant shall provide photo simulations from at least two
reasonable line-of-site locations in the vicinity of the proposed project site.
Photo simulations shall be included in the site plans on a separate sheet.
         b.    Equipment Specifications. For all equipment depicted on the
plans, the applicant shall include (1) the manufacturer's name and model
number; (2) physical dimensions, including without limitation height, width,
depth and weight with mounts and other necessary hardware; and (3) the ambient
noise level generated from the equipment, if any.
      6.    Justification Statement. For all Type II and Type III applications,
the applicant shall submit a written justification statement that includes (1)
a short, plain statement to explain the applicant's technical objective and how
the proposed facility will suit that technical objective; (2) color signal
propagation maps with objective signal measurements in dBm (RSSI or RSRP), if
the technical objective involves a gap in the applicant's service coverage; (3)
forward data volume and average eligible scheduled user data for the affected
macrosite, if the technical objective is to offload traffic from an existing
facility; and (4) evidence that the applicant engaged in a reasonably diligent
investigation as to whether any other potential locations would reasonably
achieve the applicant's technical objective, including the physical address for
each location and meaningful comparative analysis with the reasons why the
applicant ruled out each alternative location. The Engineering Division shall
not require a justification statement when the applicant proposes a Type I
application or a standard configuration facility subject to minor review.
      7.    Deposit Necessary to Cover Cost of Consultant. Notice to the
applicant that the Engineering Division has elected to retain a consultant for
services, under Section
 937.04 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Ashland, shall include an
estimated deposit required to cover the Engineering Division's costs to retain
the consultant. The estimate shall not be binding on the Engineering Division
and the Engineering Division may require further deposits.
   D.    Pre-Submittal Conference with the Engineering Division
      1.    Purpose. The Engineering Division offers pre-submittal conferences
to meet with potential applicants and discuss possible projects on a conceptual
level. The conference is intended to identify the correct application type and
content requirements for any given project, and also to create an informal
forum in which applicants and the Engineering Division can discuss any
aesthetic, historic preservation or other concerns that should be addressed as
soon as possible to avoid any unnecessary delays in the processing of an
application.
      2.    Appointment Required. An appointment is required for all pre-
submittal conferences. Each conference is generally limited to discussion of a
single potential project, but applicants may request to discuss multiple
projects.
      3.    Optional Pre-Submittal Conferences. Pre-submittal conferences are
strongly encouraged but not required for Type III applications for a standard
configuration facility subject to minor review.
      4.    Mandatory Pre-Submjttal Conferences. Pre-submittal conferences are
required for all projects subject to standard review, including without
limitation all Type II applications and all Type III for a non-standard
configuration facility.
      5.    Limited Waiver from Application Requirements. The Engineering
Division may grant a limited, written waiver from the obligation to submit a
justification statement and/or photo simulations when the Engineering Division
finds that strict compliance with the requirement would create an unnecessary
or unreasonable burden. For example, the City Engineer might waive the
justification statement for a standard configuration facility in a location
that requires standard review because the Engineering Division finds that the
specific proposed location for the facility raises no aesthetic concerns. The
applicant's request for a waiver shall describe the proposed site location and
design with sufficient particularity to allow the Engineering Division to
ascertain whether a later-submitted application is the same proposal for which
the waiver was granted.
   E.    Application Submittal Procedures. All applications shall be submitted
to the Engineering Division.
III.    MINOR MODIFICATIONS (TYPE I APPLICATION)
   A.    Overview. Minor modifications are additions or changes to facilities
previously approved by the City and covered under 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a), which
mandates approval for certain applications that do not propose a substantial
change to the underlying facility. Federal regulations provide specific
definitions and criteria for approval or denial. The provisions in this section
are intended to assist applicants and the Engineering Division to determine
whether an application qualifies for approval as a minor modification.
   B.    Criteria for Approval. The Engineering Division may approve or
conditionally approve a Type I application for a minor modification when it
finds that the proposed project:
      1.    involves collocation, removal or replacement of transmission
equipment on an existing tower or base station; and
      2.    does not substantially change the physical dimensions of the
existing tower or base station.
   C.    Criteria for Denial. Notwithstanding any other provisions in these
Standards, and consistent with all applicable federal laws and regulations, the
Engineering Division may deny a Type I application for a minor modification
when it finds that the proposed project:
      1.    does not satisfy the criteria for approval;
      2.    violates any legally enforceable standard or permit condition
reasonably related to public health and safety; or
      3.    involves the replacement of the entire support structure.
   D.    Written Decision. After the Engineering Division renders a decision,
the Engineering Division shall send written notice to the applicant. In the
event that the Engineering Division determines that a Type I application does
not qualify for approval, the Engineering Division will send written notice to
the applicant that includes the reasons to support the Engineering Division's
decision.
IV.    MAJOR MODIFICATIONS AND NEW FACILITIE (TYPES ll AND Ill APPLICATIONS)
   A.    General design principles. Every Type II and Type III wireless
communications facility shall conform to the following design concept
principles:
      1.    The proposed wireless facility, its support structure, equipment
and all associated improvements, shall be designed and sited in a manner that
is sympathetic to the particular architectural character of the buildings and
compatible with the streets cape in the vicinity of the proposed project site;
      2.    Design elements of the proposed wireless facility, its support
structure, equipment and all associated improvements , shall be sensitively
selected to reflect the detailing and materials associated with the buildings
and streetscape in the vicinity of the proposed project site;
      3.    The proposed wireless facility, its support structure, equipment
and all associated improvements, shall be designed and sited in a manner that
does not adversely impact right-of-way circulation, accessibility, or obstruct
existing or planned-future uses of the right-of-way; and
      4.    The proposed wireless facility shall comply with all applicable
design, construction and location provisions in these Standards.
   B.    General Design and Construction Standards. The Engineering Division
desires to promote cleanly organized and streamlined facilities using the
smallest and least intrusive means available. All wireless facilities in the
public right-of-way shall comply with all applicable provisions in these
standards. In the event that any other law, regulation or code requires any
more restrictive structural design and/or construction requirements, the most
restrictive requirement will control.
      1.    Collocation. The Engineering Division desires and encourages
collocations between two separate wireless service providers on the same
support structure whenever feasible and safe.
      2.    Antennas. The antenna(s) associated with the first installation
shall be topmounted and concealed within a radome that also conceals the cable
connections, antenna mount, and other hardware. The Engineering Division may
approve a side-mounted antenna with the initial installation if, at the
Engineering Division's discretion, the side-mounted antenna would be more
appropriate given the built environment, neighborhood character, overall site
appearance and would promote the purposes of these Standards. GPS antennas
shall be placed within the radome or directly above the radome not to exceed
six inches.
      3.    Pole-Mounted Equipment Cages. When pole-mounted equipment is either
permitted or required, all equipment other than the antenna(s), electric meter
and disconnect switch shall be concealed within an equipment cage not to exceed
28 cubic feet in total volume. Equipment cages may not extend more than 10
inches beyond the pole centerline on either side. The equipment cage shall be
nonreflective and painted, wrapped or otherwise colored to match the existing
pole. The City prefers and strongly encourages equipment cages to be mounted
flush to the pole. All pole-mounted equipment shall be installed as flush to
the pole as possible. Any standoff mount for the equipment cage may not exceed
4 inches and shall include metal flaps (or "wings") to conceal the space
between the cage and the pole.
      4.    Underground Equipment Vaults. The Engineering Division generally
permits pole-mounted equipment in self-contained cages, but for applications
subject to standard review, the Engineering Division may require placement of
the equipment in an underground vault.
      5.    Ground-Mounted Equipment. The Engineering Division will not approve
any new ground-mounted equipment unless the applicant (1) proposes the
groundmounted equipment in connection with a tapered metal pole and (2) shows
clear and convincing evidence that the equipment cannot be feasibly installed
as a polemounted installation, in an underground vault, or within an existing
street feature for a valid technical reason. Increased costs alone shall be
presumed to be insufficient. Ground-mounted equipment shall not be permitted in
connection with a wood pole. In the event that the Engineering Division
approves ground-mounted equipment, the applicant shall conform to the following
requirements:
         a.    Self-Contained Cabinet or Shroud. The equipment shroud or
cabinet shall contain all the equipment associated with the facility other than
the antenna. All cables and conduits associated with the equipment shall be
concealed from view, routed directly through the tapered metal pole and
underground between the pole and the ground-mounted cabinet.
         b.    Concealment. The Engineering Division may require the applicant
to incorporate concealment elements into the proposed design. Concealment may
include, but shall not be limited to, strategic placement in less obtrusive
locations and placement within existing or replacement street furniture.
         c.    Ambient Noise Suppression. The Engineering Division may require
the applicant to incorporate ambient noise suppression measures and/or require
the applicant to place the equipment in locations less likely to impact
adjacent residences or businesses to ensure compliance with all applicable
noise regulations.
      6.    Utility Lines. Utility service lines shall be underground whenever
feasible to avoid additional overhead lines. For metal poles, underground
cables and wires shall transition directly into the pole base without any
external junction box.
      7.    Electric Meter. Multiple operators on a shared pole shall share a
single electric meter. Site operators shall use the smallest and least
intrusive electric meter available. The Engineering Division strongly
encourages site operators to use flat-rate electric service when it would
eliminate the need for a meter. Whenever permitted by the electric service
provider, the electric meter should be painted to match the pole.
      8.    Telephone/Fiber Optic Utilities. Cabinets for telephone and/or
fiber optic utilities may not extend more than 10 inches beyond the pole
centerline on either side, and shall be painted, wrapped or otherwise colored
to match the pole. Microwave or other wireless backhaul is discouraged when it
would involve a separate and unconcealed antenna.
      9.    Spools and Coils. To reduce clutter and deter vandalism, excess
fiber optic or coaxial cables shall not be spooled, coiled or otherwise stored
on the pole except within the approved enclosure such as a cage or cabinet.
      10.    Underground Conduit. All underground conduit placed behind the
curb face and underneath the sidewalk and shall be Schedule 40 PVC encased in
concrete. All underground conduit shall be Schedule 40 PVC encased in rigid
metal material when place: (1) underneath driveway aprons, (2) within tree
wells or (3) in front of the curb face and beneath the street.
      11.    Above-Ground Conduit. On wood poles, all above-ground wires,
cables and connections shall be encased in the smallest section or smallest
diameter PVC channel, conduit, u-guard, or shroud feasible, with a maximum
dimension of 4" diameter, and painted to match the pole.
      12.    Ground Rods. All ground rods shall be 1" in diameter and 10 feet
in length made from copper-clad steel (high strength) as required in ASTM A325.
      13.    Lights. Unless otherwise required for compliance with FAA or FCC
regulations, the facility shall not include any permanently installed lights.
Any lights associated with the electronic equipment shall be appropriately
shielded from public view. This provision shall not be interpreted to prohibit
installations on streetlights or the installation of luminaires on new poles
when required by the Engineering Division.
      14.    Generally Applicable Health and Safety Regulations. All facilities
shall be designed, constructed, operated and maintained in compliance with all
generally applicable health and safety regulations, including without
limitation all applicable regulations for human exposure to RF emissions.
   C.    General Location Criteria
      1.    Collocation Preference. Whenever an applicant proposes to place a
new wireless facility within 300 feet of an existing wireless facility, whether
on a new pole or an existing potential support structure, the applicant shall
either collocate with the existing facility or demonstrate with clear and
convincing evidence that a collocation is either not technically feasible or
space on the existing facility is not potentially available.
      2.    General Limitation on New Poles. The Engineering Division strongly
discourages more than one (1) wireless facility on a new pole per block and
will not approve more than one per block on each side of the street unless the
applicant qualifies for a limited exception pursuant to Section
937.05(g) of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Ashland.
      3.    Alignment with Other Poles. The centerline of any new pole shall be
aligned with the centerlines of existing poles on the same sidewalk segment,
subject to required setbacks established by published utility company policies
or regulatory requirements. After the Engineering Division approves a proposed
new pole location, but before the permittee commences construction, the
permittee shall verify the correct pole alignment in the field.
      4.    Setbacks for Visibility and Access. Any new pole and/or equipment
and other improvements associated with a new pole or an existing pole shall be
setback from intersections, alleyways and driveways and placed in locations
where it will not obstruct motorists' sightlines or pedestrian access. In
general, the Engineering Division will presume that no obstruction will occur
when a new pole and/or equipment is setback at least (i) 50 feet from any
intersection; (ii) six (6) feet from any driveway cut or alleyway entrance or
exit; and (iii) six (6) feet from any permanent object or existing lawfully-
permitted encroachment in the public right-of-way, including without limitation
traffic signs and signals, street trees, open tree wells, benches or other
street furniture, streetlights, door swings, gate swings or sidewalk cafe
enclosures. The Engineering Division may, in its discretion, require an
additional setback for a specific pole when it determines that the
presumptively acceptable setback would nevertheless obstruct motorists'
sightlines or pedestrian access.
      5.    Setback from City Utilities. Setbacks from City utilities shall be
provided, as depicted within the Construction Standards.
      6.    Obstructions. Any new pole and/or equipment and other improvements
associated with a new pole or an existing pole shall not obstruct any: (i)
worker access to any above-ground or underground infrastructure for traffic
control, streetlight or public transportation, including without limitation any
curb control sign, parking meter, vehicular traffic sign or signal, pedestrian
traffic sign or signal, barricade reflectors; (ii) access to any public
transportation vehicles, street furniture, or other improvements (iii) worker
access to above-ground or underground infrastructure owned or operated by any
public or private utility agency; (iv) fire hydrant access; (v) access to any
doors, gates, sidewalk doors, passage doors, stoops or other ingress and egress
points to any building appurtenant to the right-of-way; or (vi) access to any
fire escape.
      7.    Historic or Architecturally Significant Structures. Any new pole
and/or equipment and other improvements associated with a new pole or an
existing pole may not be placed directly in front of any historic or
architecturally significant structures in prominent or highly visible
locations.
   D.    New and Replacement Poles
      1.    General Restrictions on New Wood Poles. In all locations, the
Engineering Division reserves the right to require a metal pole rather than a
wood pole based on the build and/or natural environmental character of the
proposed site location.
      2.    Overall Height. Any pole greater than 50 feet above ground level
shall be subject to standard review by the Engineering Division. The
Engineering Division shall consider other poles in vicinity, the built
environment, the neighborhood character, the overall site appearance and the
purposes in these Standards.
      3.    Pole Diameter. Any wood pole with a diameter greater than 14 inches
or any tapered metal pole with a diameter at base greater than 12 inches shall
be subject to standard review and approval by the Engineering Division. The
Engineering Division shall consider other poles in vicinity, the built
environment, the neighborhood character, the overall site appearance and the
purposes in these Standards.
      4.    Wood Pole Footings and Foundations. All new wood poles shall be
direct buried to a depth determined, stamped, sealed and signed by a
professional engineer licensed and registered by the State of Ohio, and subject
to the Engineering Division's review and approval.
      5.    Tapered Metal Pole Footings and Foundations. All new tapered metal
poles shall be supported with a reinforced concrete pier designed, stamped,
sealed and signed by a professional engineer licensed and registered by the
State of Ohio, and subject to the Engineering Division's review and approval.
Footings and anchor bolts shall be constructed from steel (high strength) per
ASTM A36, threaded (J-type/L-type), hot-dip galvanized per ODOT CMS Item 711.02
and in a length and diameter determined, stamped, sealed and signed by a
professional engineer licensed and registered by the State of Ohio, and subject
to the Engineering Division's review and approval. All anchor bolts shall be
concealed from public view with an appropriate pole boot or cover subject to
the Engineering Division's prior approval.
      6.    Tapered Metal Pole Material. All tapered metal poles shall be
constructed from hot-dip galvanized steel or other corrosion-resistant material
approved by the Engineering Division and finished in accordance with these
Standards to avoid rust stains on adjacent sidewalks, buildings or other
improvements.
      7.    Metal Pole Finish. Metal poles shall be painted black. The
applicant may select a paint or powder coat system in compliance with ASTM
standards.
      8.    Lighting and Banners. The Engineering Division may require the
applicant to install functional streetlights and/or banners when technically
feasible and the Engineering Division determines that such additions will
enhance the overall appearance and usefulness of the proposed facility.
   E.    Installations on Existing Poles and Other Potential Support Structures
      1.    General. The Engineering Division encourages applicants to consider
existing poles and other potential support structures prior to any new pole to
reduce congestion in the public right-of-way. The Engineering Division will
consider all generally applicable design, construction and location standards
when reviewing applications for new facilities installed on existing poles or
other potential support structures in the public right-of-way.
      2.    Privately-Owned Structures. For a privately-owned structure in the
public right-of-way onto which an applicant proposes to attach a wireless
communications facility, if the owner of the structure requires a restrictive
standards than those contained in these Standards, the more restrictive
standards shall control. If any portion of a privately-owned structure is on
private property, the applicant shall first obtain all applicable zoning and
building permits prior to submittal of an application to the Engineering
Division.
      3.    City-Owned Structures. The City, in its proprietary capacity,
retains sole and absolute discretion over whether and on what terms it may
allow wireless facilities on its poles and other facilities in the public
right-of-way notwithstanding conflicting design provisions set forth in these
Standards. Applicants may not submit any applications in connection with City-
owned poles or other facilities without a valid and fully executed agreement to
use the specific pole or other facility. The City shall not authorize any
attachments to City-owned infrastructure that negatively impacts the structural
integrity of the support structure.
      4.    Independent Power Source. A wireless communications facility on a
City owned potential support structure may not use the same power source that
provides power for the original purpose of the potential support structure.
      5.    City-Owned Traffic Control Signal Poles. The City prohibits non-
City owned wireless facilities (and all other non-traffic control facilities)
on City owned traffic control signal poles.
   F.    Additional Design and Construction Standards for Major Modifications
In addition to the requirements outlined herein, the Engineering Division
requires all major modifications to eligible facilities (Type II application)
to comply with the following requirements:
      1.    Coordination with Original Facility Design. The applicant shall
design the proposed installation in a manner that mimics the design and any
concealment elements of the existing facility. To the extent feasible, new
facilities should utilize capacity in existing equipment cages or cabinets and
existing conduits or risers. The Engineering Division may, at its discretion,
authorize the applicant to replace an existing equipment enclosure with a
larger one when the Engineering Division determines that a larger enclosure is
more visually appropriate than a second enclosure on the same support
structure.
      2.    Antennas. Any additional antenna(s) installed to the support
structure shall be side-mounted and parallel to the roadway. The Engineering
Division prohibits side-mounted antennas that overhang the roadway, but may
permit side-mounted antennas that overhang the sidewalk provided that the
antenna complies with all applicable setbacks requirements in these Standards.
      3.    Structural Integrity. Any additional equipment shall not negatively
impact the structural integrity of the support structure and shall comply with
all applicable local, state, and federal codes and regulations.
   G.    Standard Configuration Facilities
      1.    Definition. The Engineering Division defines a "standard
configuration facility" as a pole-mounted wireless communication facility less
than or equal to 50 feet above ground level in overall height, with pole-
mounted or underground equipment, and compliant with all applicable general
design standards and all the general location standards. Proposed facilities
with groundmounted equipment shall not be eligible for review as a standard
configuration facility. Engineering Construction Standards drawings illustrate
standard configuration facilities. To the extent that any generally applicable
standards in these Standards conflict with the design or specifications within
the Engineering Construction Standards drawings, the specifications noted
within the Standards shall control.
      2.    Applicable Standard of Review. To encourage standard configuration
facilities in appropriate locations, the Engineering Division generally applies
minor review. Applications for standard configuration facilities may require
standard review in certain locations where, for example, historic resources or
the City's investment in the public right-of-way necessitates a closer
examination or a design more tailored to the specific location and context.
Table 1 below delineates when the Engineering Division applies minor or
standard review.
Table 1 -Applicable Standard of Review for
Standard Configuration Poles by Proposed Location

Historic Districts           Standard Review    Standard Review
All Other Locations          Minor Review       Minor Review
 
      3.    Standard Configuration Facilities on Existing Poles. In accordance
with the Engineering Division's general preference for wireless facilities on
existing potential support structures, a proposed standard configuration
facility on an existing pole will be eligible for minor review provided that
the proposed facility on the existing pole does not exceed 50 feet above ground
level and the finished project complies with all applicable design,
construction and location standards.
V.    APPROVALS AND DENIALS
   A.    Required Findings for Approvals.
      1.    Standard Review. The Engineering Division may approve or
conditionally approve an application subject to standard review only when it
finds that:
         a.    the proposed wireless facility, its support structure, equipment
and all associated improvements, have been designed and sited in a manner that
is sympathetic to the particular architectural character of the buildings and
compatible with the streets cape in the vicinity of the proposed project site;
         b.    design elements of the proposed wireless facility, its support
structure, equipment and all associated improvements, have been sensitively
selected to reflect the detailing and materials associated with the buildings
and streetscape in the vicinity of the proposed project site;
         c.    the proposed wireless facility, its support structure, equipment
and all associated improvements, have been designed and sited in a manner that
does not adversely impact right-of-way circulation, accessibility, or obstruct
existing or planned-future uses of the right-of-way; and
         d.    the proposed wireless facility complies with all applicable
design, construction and location provisions in the Standards.
      2.    Minor Review. The Engineering Division may approve or conditionally
approve an application for a standard configuration facility subject to minor
review only when it fmds the following:
         a.    the proposed project complies with all applicable design and
construction standards for a standard configuration facility;
         b.    the proposed project complies with all applicable location
standards; and
         c.    the project is proposed in a location identified appropriate for
minor review in Table 1 above.
   B.    Minor Technical Exceptions.
      1.    Purpose. The Engineering Division recognizes that in some
circumstances strict compliance with these Standards may result in undesirable
aesthetic outcomes, and that minor deviations should be granted when the need
for such deviation arises from circumstances outside the applicant's control.
For example, if an applicant proposes to construct a standard configuration
facility in an office district, but required a pole with a slightly wider base
due to a poor foundation conditions, the Engineering Division would consider
granting a technical exception rather than subjecting an otherwise preferred
design to a standard review. This section describes the required fmdings for a
minor technical exception.
      2.    Required Findings. The Engineering Division may, in its sole
discretion, grant a minor technical exception from strict compliance with the
design and location guidelines when the Engineering Division finds that:
         a.    the applicant has requested an exception in writing;
         b.    the proposed facility would normally qualify for minor review
but for the need for a minor technical exception;
         c.    the need for the exception arises from an external factor
outside the applicant's control that impact public health, safety or welfare,
including without limitation soil compaction, existing congestion or clutter
within the right-of-way or other location-specific phenomenon; and
         d.    the granting of a minor technical exception would not create any
obvious hazard or unreasonable obstruction in the public right-of-way.
      C.    Written Decision. After the Engineering Division renders a
decision, the Engineering Division shall send written notice to the applicant.
Any denial shall include the reasons for the denial, and information about how
and when to file an appeal.
VI.    STANDARD CONDITIONS OF PERMIT
   A.    Standard conditions of approval. Permission to site wireless
communications facilities in the right of way shall be conditioned in
compliance with the standard conditions of approval provided herein. The
Engineering Division may add or modify conditions of approval as necessary or
appropriate to protect and promote the public health, safety, and welfare.
   B.    Right-of-Way Permit duration. For Type II and Type III permits, the
Right-of- Way Permit will automatically expire ten years from the issuance
date, except when federal or state law authorizes the City to issue a permit
with a shorter term. Any request for a permit renewal shall be reviewed as
request for a new permit subject to all applicable procedures and standards in
effect at the time the request is received.
   C.    Standard conditions of approval for Type I permits. Any Type I permit
approved or deemed granted by the operation of law shall be automatically
subject to the following conditions of approval:
      1.    Permit duration. The City's grant or grant by operation of law of a
Type I permit constitutes a federally-mandated modification to the underlying
permit or approval of the subject tower and/or base station. The City's grant
or grant by operation of law of a Type I permit will not extend the permit term
for any underlying permit or other regulatory approval, and its term shall be
coterminous with the underlying permit or other regulatory approval for the
subject tower or base station.
      2.    Accelerated permit terms due to invalidation. In the event that any
court of competent jurisdiction invalidates any portion of 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a)
or any FCC rule that interprets 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a) such that federal law would
not mandate approval of any Type I permit, such permit shall automatically
expire one year from the effective date of the judicial order, unless the
decision specifically does not authorize accelerated termination of previously
approved Type I permits. A permittee shall not be required to remove its
improvements approved under the invalidated Type I permit if it submits an
application for a Type II or Type III permit for those improvements before the
one-year period ends. The Engineering Division may extend beyond one-year the
time in which a permittee may apply for a Type II or Type III permit for an
invalidated Type I permit.
      3.    No waiver of standing. The City's grant or grant by operation of
law of a Type I permit does not waive, and shall not be construed to waive, any
standing by the City to challenge 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a), any FCC rules that
interpret 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a), or any particular Type I permit.
   D.    Standard conditions of approval for all Right-of-Way permits. All
Right-of- Way permits issued shall be subject to the following standard
conditions of approval by operation of law:
      1.    Compliance with all applicable laws. Permittee shall at all times
maintain compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws,
regulations, ordinances, and other rules.
      2.    Inspections and emergencies. The City or its designee may inspect a
wireless communications facility in the right of way upon reasonable notice to
the permittee. The permittee shall cooperate with all inspections. The City
reserves the right to support, repair, disable, or remove any elements of the
facility in emergencies or when the facility threatens imminent harm to persons
or property.
      3.    Contact information for responsible parties. Permittee shall at all
times maintain accurate contact information for all parties responsible for the
facility, which shall include a phone number, street mailing address, and email
address for at least one natural person. All such contact information for
responsible parties shall be provided to the Engineering Division.
      4.    Indemnities. The permittee and, if applicable, the non-government
owner of a wireless communications facility shall defend, indemnify, and hold
harmless the City and its agents, officers, officials, and employees from:
         a.    Any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs, and
expenses arising out of any claims, demands, lawsuits, writs of mandamus, or
other actions or proceedings brought against the City to challenge, attack,
seek to modify, set aside, void, or annul the City's approval of the applicable
Right-of-Way Permit; and
         b.    Any and all damages, liabilities, injuries, losses, costs, and
expenses and any claims, demands, lawsuits, or other actions or proceedings of
any kind, whether for personal injury, death, or property damage, arising out
of or in connection with the activities or performance of the permittee or its
agents, employees, licensees, contractors, subcontractors, or independent
contractors.
         c.    In the event the City becomes aware of any such actions or
claims, the City shall promptly notify the permittee and shall reasonably
cooperate in the defense. It is expressly agreed that the City shall have the
right to approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the legal
counsel providing the City's defense, and the permittee (as applicable) shall
reimburse City for any costs and expenses directly and necessarily incurred by
the City in the course of the defense.
      5.    Interference with public safety radio services. In the event that
the City has reason to believe that permittee's wireless communications
operations are causing interference with the City's radio communications
operations, then the permittee shall, at its cost, immediately cooperate with
the City to either rule out permittee as the interference source or eliminate
the interference. Cooperation with the City may include, but shall not be
limited to, temporarily switching the transmission equipment on and off for
testing.
      6.    Adverse impacts on adjacent properties. Permittee shall undertake
all reasonable efforts to avoid undue adverse impacts to adjacent properties
and/or uses that may arise from the construction, operation, maintenance,

standards.
      11.    Relocation for public improvement projects. Permittee shall remove
and relocate the permitted wireless communications facility at permittee's sole
expense to accommodate construction of any public improvement project by the
City.
      12.    Removal if discontinued use. In the event that the use of a
wireless communications facility is discontinued, the owner shall provide
written notice to the City of its intent to discontinue use and the date when
the use shall be discontinued. If a wireless communications facility is not
removed within ninety (90) days of discontinued use, the City may remove it at
the owner's expense irrespective of the notice requirement under this section.
      13.    Taxes and assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments
are imposed by taxing authorities on the use of City property as a result of an
applicant's use or occupation of the right of way, the applicant shall be
responsible for payment of such taxes, payable annually unless otherwise
required by the taxing authority.
      14.    Prevention of failures and accidents. Any person who owns a
wireless communications facility sited in the right of way shall at all times
employ ordinary and reasonable care and install and maintain in use nothing
less than the best available technology for preventing failures and accidents

1111.01 TITLE.
   These Regulations contained in Chapters
1111 to
1121, inclusive, shall be known and may be cited as the "Subdivision
Regulations for the City of Ashland, Ohio," and shall hereinafter be referred
to as "these Regulations."
(Ord. 39-81. Passed 10-7-81.)
1111.02 INTERPRETATION AND PURPOSE.
   In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these Subdivision
Regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements to provide for the
coordination of subdivision streets with existing streets and roads, or with
the plan, or plats, of the City, for the proper amount of open spaces for
traffic, circulation and utilities, and for the avoidance of future congestion
of population detrimental to the public health and safety.
(Ord. 39-81. Passed 10-7-81.)
1111.03 SCOPE.
   These Subdivision Regulations shall not apply to any lot, or lots, forming a
part of a subdivision created and recorded prior to the effective date of these
Regulations; nor is it intended by these Regulations to repeal, abrogate, annul
or in any way impair or interfere with existing provisions of other laws or
regulations, except those specifically repealed by these Regulations, or with
private restrictions placed upon property by deed, covenant or other private
agreement, or with restrictive covenants running with the land to which the
City is a party. Where these Regulations impose a greater restriction upon land
than is imposed or required by such existing provisions of law, ordinance,
contract or deed, the provisions of these Regulations shall control. (Ord. 39-
81. Passed 10-7-81.)
1111.04 AUTHORITY OF PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (a)    City Planning Commission. The City Planning Commission shall have all
powers and authority vested by virtue of the Ohio Revised Code and all City
Ordinances, including these Subdivision Regulations. A Master Plan for the area
in and around the City having been adopted by the Commission, no plat of a
subdivision of land within such area shall be recorded until it has been
approved by the Commission and such approval endorsed in writing on the plat.
   (b)    Cooperation with Regional Planning Commission. Although the City
Planning Commission has exclusive jurisdiction for approval of plats in the
area outside of the corporation limits, but within three miles thereof, it is
the desire of the City Commission to preserve and maintain a spirit of mutual
cooperation between the City Commission and the Ashland Regional Planning
Commission and to enable the City Commission to continue to benefit from the
review and suggestions of the Regional Commission. Therefore, for as long as
such remains the desire of the City Commission, or for as long as the Regional
Commission is willing to cooperate with the City Commission in this respect,
the City Commission shall develop and carry out a method of review and
recommendation by the Regional Commission by which this desire will be
effected. (Ord. 39-81. Passed 10-7-81.)
1111.05 AREAS OF JURISDICTION.
   These Subdivision Regulations shall apply to all plats and subdivisions of
land in the City or plats within three miles of the corporation limits thereof,
as described in Ohio R.C. 711.09. The Planning Commission shall have the power
of final approval of all plats and subdivisions within the City and all plats
outside of the City, but within three miles thereof.
(Ord. 39-81. Passed 10-7-81.)
1111.06 JURISDICTION.
   (a)    Approval. No person shall subdivide or develop any land within the
City or three mile area, unless it is by a plat complying with the regulations
herein contained, except as provided in subsection (c) hereof and no plat shall
be recorded, and no lot or land shall be sold from any such plat until such
plat has been approved as herein required. (See definition of Subdivision,
Section 
1111.10  [53])
   (b)    Design and Layout. The design and layout of all subdivisions shall
conform with the requirements of these Subdivision Regulations. The subdivider
shall submit sketches and preliminary and final plats, etc., all in accordance
with these Regulations.
   (c)    Plat Not Always Required. A proposed division of a lot parcel or
tract of land, shown as a unit on the last preceding tax roll, along an
existing public street or road, not involving or conflicting with the opening,
widening or extension of any street or road and involving no more than five
lots after the original tract has been completely subdivided, may be submitted
to the *appropriate Planning Commission for approval in the form of a "Survey
Drawing" in lieu of a plat. If the *appropriate Commission, acting through its
staff, is satisfied that such proposed division is not contrary to applicable
platting, subdividing or zoning regulations, it shall, within seven working
days after submission, approve such proposed division. On presentation of a
Survey Drawing of such parcel, the same shall be stamped in such a manner as to
indicate clearly the approval of the *appropriate Commission and shall bear the
signature of the staff member responsible. Upon approval, the Conveyance,
together with the Survey Drawing, shall be recorded in accordance with the
customary recording process. The development of property, except for
agricultural purposes, to accommodate more than one main building shall always
be reviewed and approved by the Commissions, following the same procedure as a
"Plat."
*Within City - City Planning Commission only; Outside of City - Regional
Planning Commission only.

1113.01 SUITABILITY OF THE LAND FOR SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)    Advisability. The subdivision proposed and its ultimate use shall be
in the best interests of the public welfare and the neighborhood development of
the area. The subdivider shall present evidence to this effect when requested
by the Planning Commission.
   (b)    Encroachment. The tract to be subdivided should not be a part of, or
encroach upon, an area, or areas, designated in the Major Thoroughfare Plan and
the Plan for parks and other public grounds, as adopted for future public
facilities.
   (c)    Suitability of Land. If the Commission finds that land proposed to be
subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding or its
location in a flood plain, bad drainage, steep slopes, rock formations and
other such conditions as may increase the danger to health, life or property or
aggravate erosion or flood hazards and, if from adequate investigations
conducted by all the public agencies concerned it has been determined that in
the best interest of the public the land should not be platted and developed
for the purpose proposed, the Commission shall not approve the land for
subdivision unless adequate methods are formulated by the subdivider for
meeting the problems that shall be created by the subdivision and development
of the land.
   Land subject to flooding or located in a flood plain and land deemed to be
topographically unsuitable for residential development shall not be platted for
residential use or for any other use which may increase the danger of health,
life or property or aggravate erosion or flood hazards. Such land within the
subdivision shall be set aside on the plat for such uses as will not be
endangered by periodic or occasional inundation or shall not result in
conditions contrary to the public welfare. To ensure that lots shall be located
only where they will provide flood-free house sites, the Commission may require
the subdivider to provide elevation and flood profiles sufficient to
demonstrate that the house sites shall be completely free from the danger of
flooding.
   A condition of flooding shall be defined as the depth of water anticipated,
up to and including a 100 year storm, as computed using approved runoff factors
for a completely developed drainage area and by using the current criteria of
the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and/or the Federal Insurance and
Hazard Mitigation Office, whichever is higher; also, flooding is where water
will be impounded or "backed up" due to restrictions in drainage facilities,
either natural or man-made.
   If a stream flows through, or adjacent to, the proposed subdivision, the
plat plan shall provide for an easement or right-of-way along the stream for a
floodway. For the smaller streams, the plan shall also provide for channel
improvement to enable them to carry all reasonable floods within banks. The
floor elevations of buildings shall be high enough to be well above the flood
level defined above. The floodway easement shall be wide enough to provide for
future enlargement of the stream channel as adjacent areas become more highly
developed and runoff rates are increased. (See Section
1115.06.)
   (d)    Suitable Location. The Commission may refuse to approve what it
considers to be scattered or premature subdivision of land which would involve
danger or injury to the public health, safety, welfare or prosperity by reason
of lack of adequate water supply, schools, proper drainage, good roads and
transportation facilities, or other public services, or which would necessitate
an excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services, such
as undue maintenance costs for adequate roads.
   (e)    Railroads. Where railroads are involved, provision for grade
separations, buffer strips and other protective media shall be required to the
extent and type as may be practicable.
   (f)    Subdivision and Street Names and Numbers. Subdivision and street
names shall not duplicate or be confusing with existing names. For purposes of
street naming, the following suffixes shall apply:
      (1)    Avenue, Street, Road or Way shall be used for relatively long
streets having relatively straight alignment.
      (2)    Boulevard or Drive shall be used for relatively long meandering
streets.
      (3)    Circle, Place, Court or Lane shall be used for cul-de-sacs or
relatively short loop streets.
      (4)   Suffixes other than the above shall be approved by the Commission.
      (5)    The words north, south, east or west should be avoided as part of
a street name.
   Extensions of existing streets shall bear the name of the existing street.
All names are subject to the approval of the Commission.
   All streets situated outside of the City shall be assigned numbers by the
County Engineer. (Ord. 39-81. Passed 10-7-81.)
1113.02 DIMENSIONS, LAYOUT AND DESIGN STANDARDS.
   Dimensions, layout and design standards shall be in accordance with Chapters
1113 and
1115. (Ord 39-81. Passed 10-7-81.)
1113.03 STREETS, ALLEYS, EASEMENTS, ETC.
   (a)    Conformity to Major Thoroughfare Plan, etc. 
      (1)    Streets shall conform in effect to the Major Thoroughfare Plan or
such part thereof as is adopted by the Planning Commission. If a tentative or
suggested plan or plat for the area has been made by the Commission or any
other public agency designated by the Commission, the street layout shall be in
general conformance thereto.
      (2)    Frontage on high volume express highways or railroads shall be
provided with a parallel service street or such other medium of access as may
be appropriate to the conditions.
   
   (b)    Street Extensions. 
      (1)    The street layout of the proposed subdivision shall provide for
the continuation or projection of streets already existing in areas adjacent to
the area being subdivided unless the Commission deems such continuation or
extension undesirable for specific reasons of topography or design.
      (2)    Where, in the opinion of the Commission, it is desirable to
provide street access to adjoining properties, proposed streets shall be
extended by dedication and improvement to the boundaries of such properties.
      (3)    The street system for the proposed subdivision shall provide for
extending existing streets at the same or greater width, but in no case shall a
street extension be of less width than the minimum width required in these
regulations for a street in its category.
   (c)    Dedication of Right-of-Way for New Streets.
         Street Type                                                 Minimum Right-of-Way (in feet)

of the appropriate Township zoning regulations and regulations imposed by the
City- County Health Department. The depth of lots shall not exceed three times
the lot width unless specifically permitted by the Planning Commission.
   (e)    Landlocked Parcel. A subdivider cannot create or transfer a
landlocked parcel except that such parcel shall be transferred to an owner of a
contiguous, non-landlocked parcel and provided such subdivider complies with
all other provisions of these subdivision regulations.
   (f)    Large Tracts or Parcels. When the land is subdivided into large
parcels rather than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged so
as to allow for the opening of future streets and logical further
resubdivision.
(Ord. 39-81. Passed 10-7-81.)
1113.06 STREET TREES.
   Street trees shall be placed at least ten feet outside the street right-of-

subdivider dedicate or deed to the City or Township other lands of the
subdivider which are acceptable to the Commission for the purposes intended by
this section or to deposit with the City or appropriate township a sum of money
equal in amount to three percent (3%) of the total value of the land within the
subdivision. Such three percent (3%) value shall be determined by agreement
between the Commission and the subdivider or shall be three percent (3%) of
one-half of the total of two sealed land appraisals of the subdivision to be
submitted to the Commission, one by an appraiser designated by the subdivider
and one by an appraiser designated by the Commission, provided that the sealed
appraisals shall each be within fifteen percent (15%) of the average of such
new appraisals. The Commission and the subdivider shall each bear the costs of
their respective appraisals.

shall be made by a majority thereof.
            (Ord. 17-89. Passed 4-18-89.)
         C.    Factors to be considered in determining whether a waiver shall
be granted shall include, but not be limited to, terrain, engineering
difficulties, dimensions of lot, absence of adjacent sidewalks (only in areas
platted before 1988 - "Platted," for this purpose, means that the lots and
streets of an allotment plan have been approved by the Planning Commission and
Director of Engineering, offered for dedication, accepted by Council for
dedication and recorded in the office of the County Recorder as so dedicated
and accepted), any unusual circumstances and any other matters which may be
relevant to a determination of the application.
            (Ord. 55-92. Passed 10-6-92.)
         D.    Council may grant either a complete waiver of the sidewalk
requirement, may grant a temporary extension of time for compliance with the

eight inches in diameter, the City may pay the difference between the cost of
the larger size specified or approved and an eight inch diameter pipe. These
costs shall be determined by the estimate of the City Engineer. The City may,
at its option, furnish materials to satisfy its participation in the cost of
the increased size of the waterlines and appurtenances. All building services
shall be installed in accordance with the current Water Department Rules and
Regulations. Where the City water system is not reasonably accessible, a
private or individual system shall be developed for each lot in accordance with

1115.05 SANITARY SEWERS.
   (a)    Within the City. Subdivisions shall, where the City sanitary sewer
system is reasonably available as determined by the City Engineer, connect to
and extend throughout the subdivision a complete sanitary sewer system in
accordance with the Standard Drawing and Standard Specifications of the City of
Ashland, all in accordance with accepted engineering practice and subject to
the approval of the City Engineer. The maximum manhole spacing shall be 400
feet.
   Where the City sanitary sewer system is not reasonably available, as
determined by the City Engineer, the subdivider shall construct a private or
individual system for each lot in accordance with the regulations of the City-
County Health Department and the Ohio E.P.A. Where required by either of the
above agencies or at the option of the subdivider, a group or community system
shall be constructed. If a private, individual, group or community system is
constructed, the subdivider and each subsequent lot owner shall agree in
writing to pay the appropriate cost of and connect to and use the City sanitary
sewer system immediately upon the availability of same as determined by the
City Engineer.
   Council shall approve each individual septic tank or community system prior
to construction.
   All sanitary sewers, mains, laterals, manholes and appurtenances shall
conform to the City of Ashland Standard Drawings and Specifications. The
minimum size lateral shall be four inches, unless otherwise specified by the
City Engineer, and the main shall have a minimum diameter of eight inches.
However, the pipe installed shall be of the size specified or approved by the
City Engineer. If the specified or approved pipe size exceeds eight inches in
diameter, the City may pay the difference between the cost of the larger size
specified or approved and an eight inch diameter pipe. These costs shall be
determined by the estimate of the City Engineer. The City may furnish materials
to satisfy its participation in the increased cost of sanitary sewers and
appurtenances.
   (b)    Outside of the City, but Within Three Miles Thereof. Subdivisions in
this area shall develop a private or individual system for each lot in
accordance with the requirements of the City- County Health Department and the

   An approved clean-out shall be installed at the end of all lines within the
right of way and at intervals of 400 feet or less.
   Collector lines within the street right of way shall have a minimum inside
diameter of six inches. (See subsection (i) hereof for possible exceptions.)
   (h)    Drainage Easements and Rights of Way. Where ditches, storm sewers or
other drainage structures exist or are constructed outside of the dedicated
street right of way, written easements of sufficient width, but not less than
twenty feet wide, shall be provided to the applicable City, Township or County
to ensure proper maintenance and reconstruction.
   Where structures are situated essentially within a street right of way, but
additional right of way is required to accommodate the structure or provide for
proper maintenance, repair, or reconstruction, additional right of way shall be
dedicated.
   When it is required of the developer to convey surface water outside the
limits of the proposed improved area in order to discharge into an approved
adequate outlet, it shall be the responsibility of the developer to obtain
easements and/or right of way for construction and/or maintenance of such
drainage course.
   All drainage easements shall be shown on the plat and construction plans.
The written drainage easements shall be recorded for public use forever.
   (i)    Stormwater Management and Control. Stormwater Management and Control
for the entire project shall ensure that the peak rate of runoff from the area
after development shall not exceed the peak rate of runoff from the same area
before development for all storms from a one year to a 100 year frequency,
twenty-four hour storm.
      (1)    The designer shall first determine the total volume of runoff from
a one year frequency, twenty-four hour storm, occurring on the area before and
after development.
      (2)    Next, the designer shall determine the percent increase in volume
of runoff due to development, and using this percentage, pick the critical
storm from the following table:
Table 1
If the percentage of increase in volume of runoff is:
Equal to or greater than: And less than: The critical storm for discharge
                                         limitation shall be: (years)
–                       10             1
10                        20             2
20                        50             5
50                        100            10
100                       250            25
250                       500            50
500                       –            100
 
      (3)    The peak rate of runoff from the critical storm and all more
frequent storms occurring on the development area shall not exceed the peak
rate of runoff from a one year frequency, twenty-four hour storm occurring on
the same area under pre-development conditions. Storms of less frequent
occurrence (longer return periods) than the critical storm up to the 100 year
storm shall have peak runoff rates no greater than the peak runoff rates from
equivalent size storms under pre-development conditions. As an example, if the
total volume of runoff is shown to be increased by fifty-eight percent (58%),
the critical storm is a ten year storm. The peak rate of runoff for the one,
two, five and ten year storms shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak
rate of runoff from a one year frequency storm on the area under pre-
development conditions. The runoff from the twenty-five, fifty and 100 year
storms need only be controlled to the peak rate of runoff from equivalent size
storms under pre-development conditions.
      (4)    Storage volume does not have to be provided for runoff from off-
site upstream areas. Upstream runoff waters should be conveyed through the site
in accordance with current runoff conditions.
      (5)    The following and other approved means may be employed to
accomplish the desired Stormwater management and control:
         A.    Construction of on-site and off-site retention basins or
detention basins with restricted outlets or pumps. These basins should, where
possible, be constructed to provide for multiple purposes including stormwater
control, sedimentation control, fire protection, aesthetics and recreation
facilities;
         B.    Construction of surface storage basins such as backyard and
roadway drainage ditches, parking lots, rooftops, etc., with restricted
outlets;
         C.    Construction of subsurface storage structures such as oversized
drainage pipes, subbasements, etc;
         D.    Direct discharge of roof drainage to lawn areas where the flow
can be adequately accommodated by an orderly and comprehensive stormwater
management program;
         E.    Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for example,
grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical, or grass
and rock-lined drainage channels;
         F.    Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a level
of control in flow paths and stream gradients;
         G.    Induced infiltration of increased stormwater runoff into the
soil where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas
where veils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be vegetated or
providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities;
         H.    On-stream retention basins with gravity operation of regulated
outlets;
         I.    Side-stream retention basins with gravity operation by regulated
outlets or pumped return;
         J.    Large retention basins with permanent recreation basins either
on stream or side-stream with gravity operation by regulated outlets or pumped
return with or without drainage area diversion;
         K.    Stream flow regulation and/or control devices, backwater
retention weirs, etc;
      (6)    The purpose of these required procedures is to:
         A.    Permit development without increasing the flooding of other
lands;
         B.    Minimize damage to receiving streams caused by accelerated
runoff;
         C.    Provide a basis for design of storm drainage systems or lands
above or below undeveloped areas which shall preserve the rights and options of
both contributing and receiving property owners and assure the long-term
adequacy of storm drainage systems; and
         D.    Eliminate the need for oversizing storm drainage facilities in
anticipation of what may be developed upstream in the future.
      (7)    A final stormwater management and control plan shall be submitted
to the City Engineer and, where applicable, the County Engineer for final
approval. Before the final plan is completed, it is encouraged that the design
engineer consult the appropriate Engineers so that the plan can be developed in
accordance with currently accepted policy and criteria. The final plan shall
include all the engineering data required in subsection (a) through (i)(6)
hereof, and shall also include:
         A.    The predevelopment rate of runoff and intensity for the various
rainfall frequencies used in the analysis;
         B.    The hydrologic data of the tributary area, including time of
concentration, intensity and runoff coefficients;
         C.    The location of the proposed retention or detention facility in
relation to the tributary area;
         D.    The inflow hydrographs for the tributary area prior to
development for the various rainfall frequencies used in the analysis outlined
herein;
         E.    The critical storm hydrograph based on the criteria outlined
herein;
         F.    The storm hydrographs of the less frequent occurrences to check
peak runoff rates;
         G.    The maximum permitted release rate from the retention or
detention facility, that is the outflow hydrograph;
         H.    The storage volume required for the retention or detention
facility;
         I.    The design of a spillway or other means for release of stored
water and for bypassing excess flows of exceedingly rare rainfalls that cannot
be accommodated by the storage facility;
         J.    Provide method for complete and timely drainage of stored runoff
by provision of sufficient basin slope, adequate pumping facilities and/or
alternate release mechanisms for stored runoff without causing secondary
problems;
         K.    Types of facility for retention or detention such as rooftop,
parking lot, park pond, etc; and
         L.    Safety precautions which shall include fencing, guard railing,
maximum side slopes, vegetation and control.
      (8)    The appropriate County, Township or City shall assume
responsibility for permanent maintenance of the major structures and facilities
designed to control and manage stormwater runoff. The maintenance of minor
detention areas, generally grassed areas which are portions of individual lots,
shall be the responsibility of individual owners. Special covenants shall be
written into the title of individual lots so that the owners are aware that
portions of their property shall be used for temporary water storage.
      (9)    Ownership and/or easements for the purpose of maintenance shall be
granted to the appropriate governmental subdivision for access to all major
stormwater control structures and facilities for which the subdivision is
assuming permanent maintenance responsibility.
      (10)    Financing of the permanent maintenance of the major stormwater
control structures and facilities shall be handled through a "perpetual
maintenance agreement" whereby all *benefitting property owners in the drainage
area shall be assessed their proportionate share of the maintenance costs.
These assessments shall be certified in accordance with appropriate sections of
the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 39-81. Passed 10-7-81.)
*Legal definition.

alteration of such structure or part has been completed in conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Code, the administrative officer shall issue such
certificate of occupancy within three days after written request has been made.
   Pending the issuance of a regular certificate, a temporary certificate of
occupancy may be issued for a period not exceeding six months during the
completion of the alterations, or during partial occupancy of a building
pending its completion. Such temporary certificate shall not be construed as in
any way altering the respective rights, duties or obligations of the owners or
of the City relating to the use or occupancy of the premises, or any other
matter covered by this Zoning Code; and such temporary certificate shall not be
issued except under such restrictions and provisions as will adequately insure
the safety of the occupants.
   (d)    Application for Certificate; Fee. A certificate of occupancy shall
state that the building or proposed use of a building or land complies with all
the building and health laws and ordinances, and with the provisions of these
regulations. A record of all certificates shall be kept on file in the office
of the administrative officer, and copies shall be furnished on request to any
person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the building affected. No
fee shall be charged for an original certificate applied for at the same time
as the application for a building permit. However, in the event that any
excavation, construction or alteration has been started prior to the
application for a certificate of occupancy, a fee of five dollars ($5.00) shall
be charged for such certificate. For copies of an original certificate, there
shall be a charge of one dollar ($1.00) each.
   (e)    Excavation Permit. No permit for excavation for any building shall be
issued before application has been made for a certificate of occupancy.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1133.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates any provision of this Zoning Code for which no other
penalty is provided shall be fined not less than five dollars ($5.00) nor more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues. The
owner of any buildings or premises or part thereof, where anything in violation
of this Zoning Code is placed or exists, and any architect, builder,
contractor, agent or person employed in connection therewith and who may have
assisted in the commission of any such violation, shall be guilty of a separate
offense.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)

1135.01 MEMBERSHIP.
   An administrative board called the Zoning Board of Appeals is hereby
established and the word "Board" when used in this Zoning Code shall mean the
"Ashland City Zoning Board of Appeals".
   The Planning Commission, with the exception of the Mayor and City Engineer,
shall be the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   The City Engineer shall serve as secretary to the Board. The secretary will
not be a voting member and no member shall receive a fee for his services but
shall be paid all expenses incurred while on business of the Board, upon
approval of the Board.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1135.02 HEARINGS; RULES OF PROCEDURE.
   The hearings of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be public; however, the
Board may go into executive session for discussion and vote on any case before
it. The Board shall organize annually and elect a President and a Vice-
President. The Board shall act by resolution in which three members must
concur. The Board shall adopt from time to time such rules and regulations as
it may deem necessary to carry into effect the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   The Board shall hear the intervention of any owner of property adjacent to,
in the rear of or across the street from a lot to which the granting of any
building permit is pending, and shall also hear any other interested parties.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1135.03 WITNESSES, OATHS, CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to subpoena witnesses,
administer oaths and punish for contempt, and may require the production of
documents under such regulations as it may establish.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1135.04 APPEAL PROCEDURE.
   Appeals may be taken to and before the Zoning Board of Appeals by any person
aggrieved, or by an officer, department, board or bureau of the City. Such
appeal shall be taken within such time as is prescribed by the general rules of
the Board, by filing, with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with
the Board, a notice of appeal, and specifying the grounds thereof. The office
or department from which the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the
Board all of the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed
from was taken.
   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the administrative officer shall certify to the Board, after the
notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining
order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of equity after notice to
the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
   The Board shall fix a time, not to exceed sixty days from the date of
appeal, for the date of hearing of the appeal or other matters referred to it,
and shall give public notice of such hearing. A decision of the Board on the
appeal shall be reached within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing, any party
may appeal in person or agent or by attorney. The Board may reverse or affirm,
wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirements, decision or
determination appealed from, and shall make such order, requirement, decision
or determination as, in its opinion, ought to be made in the premises, and to
that end shall have all powers of the administrative officer from whom the
appeal is taken.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed4-5-66.)
1135.05 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (a)    The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have as its duty the hearing and
deciding of appeals where it is alleged that a building permit has been refused
the person appealing. In hearing and deciding appeals, the Board shall have the
power to grant an exception or variation in the following instances:
      (1)    Interpret the provisions of this Zoning Code in such a way as to
carry out the intent and purpose of the plan as shown upon the map fixing the
several districts accompanying and made a part of this Zoning Code, where the
street layout actually on the ground varies from the street layout as shown on
the aforesaid map.
      (2)    Permit the remodeling or expanding of a nonconforming building or
reconstruction when damaged by explosion, fire, act of God or the public enemy,
to the extent of more than seventy-five percent of its fair market value, where
the Board finds some compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the
nonconforming use.
      (3)    Waive or reduce the parking and loading requirements in any of the
districts whenever the character or use of the building is such as to make
unnecessary the full provision of parking or loading facilities, or where such
regulations would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as
contrasted with merely granting an advantage or a convenience.
      (4)    Permit land within 300 feet of a multiple dwelling to be improved
for the parking spaces required in connection with a multiple dwelling, but
only when there is positive assurance that such land will be used for such
purpose during the existence of the multiple dwelling.
      (5)    Permit a variation in the yard requirements of any district where
there are unusual and practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the
carrying out of these provisions due to an irregular shape of the lot,
topographical or other conditions, provided such variation will not seriously
affect any adjoining property or the general welfare.
      (6)    Permit an industry or business in a B-2 or B-3 Business District
or in an M- 1 Light Industrial District by reason of its nonobjectionable
nature or effect upon the surrounding area.
   (b)    The Board shall have the authority to evaluate and determine whether
the character or magnitude of an occupation conducted in a residence is such
that it may be classified or continued to be classified as a home occupation.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
   (c)    The Board shall have the authority to permit a variation in the sign
requirements in any zoning district where there are unusual and practical
difficulties or unnecessary hardships in complying with such requirements,
provided that any such variation shall not unreasonably affect any adjoining
property or the general welfare and further provided that the purpose and
intent of the sign requirements not be diminished any more than is reasonably
necessary to permit the variation. (Ord. 31-82. Passed 6-15-82.)
1135.06 STANDARDS.
   (a)    In considering all appeals and all proposed exceptions or variations
to this Zoning Code, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall, before making any
exceptions or variations from this Zoning Code in a specific case, first
determine that it will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to
adjacent property, unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets,
increase the danger of fire or endanger the public safety, unreasonably
diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding area or
in any other respect impair the public health, safety, comfort, morals or
welfare of the inhabitants of the City.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
   (b)    The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the authority to evaluate and
determine whether the character or magnitude of any home occupation is such
that it may be classified as a professional, light or heavy home occupation as
defined in this Zoning Code and to perform all other duties and
responsibilities described in Chapter
1171, "Home Occupations".
1135.07 FEE FOR APPEAL.
   A fee of thirty dollars ($30.00) shall be paid to the administrative officer
at the time the notice of appeal is filed, which the officer shall forthwith
pay over to the Finance Director to the credit of the General Revenue Fund of
the City.

lines, the street or alley shall be construed to be the boundary of the
district;
   (b)    Where the district boundaries are not otherwise indicated, and where
the property has been or may hereafter be divided into blocks and lots, the
district boundaries shall be construed to be the lot lines; and where the
districts, designated on the Map are bounded approximately by lot lines, the
lot lines shall be construed to be the boundary of the districts, unless the
boundaries are otherwise indicated on the Map; and

shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the Map.
      (Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1141.04 ANNEXED LAND; CLASSIFICATION.
   Upon annexation of territory to the existing Municipal corporation of the

hereafter erected shall not be encroached upon or considered as required yard
or open space for any building, nor shall any lot area be reduced below the
requirements of this Zoning Code except as specifically provided in this Zoning
Code.
   (d)    In residential districts, there shall be no more than one main
building located on one lot or tract, except as hereinafter provided, and when

1143.01 REQUIREMENTS FOR CHANGE.
   Whenever the public necessity, convenience, general welfare or good zoning
practice justify such action, and after consideration by the Planning
Commission, Council may by ordinance change the regulations set forth in this
Zoning Code and may change the zoning districts as established on the District
Map.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1143.02 APPLICATION FOR OR INITIATION OF CHANGE.
   A proposed change of district or of text may be initiated by the Planning
Commission, the City Council or by an application of one or more owners of
property within the area proposed to be changed.
   Any communication purporting to be an appeal shall be regarded as mere
notice to seek relief, until it is made in the form required. Upon receipt of
any such communication, the applicant shall be supplied with the proper form
for presenting his appeal.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1143.03 PETITION AND HEARING BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   A petition and accompanying map, being a part of every application for
changes in the district lines, shall be circulated by the applicant in the
vicinity of the lot for which a change of zoning is requested. It shall be
circulated to the owners of all property adjacent to, in the rear of, or across
the street from the property for which a change of zoning is requested, and
shall be checked by the administrative officer as to validity of signatures.
Obtaining the signatures of adjacent property owners shall be merely indicative
of their feeling in the matter and shall not be binding on the Planning
Commission in any way.
   If there appears to be doubt that all affected owners were canvassed with
the petition, or if opposition to the change has been expressed by affected
owners, then the Commission may hold a public hearing on the request after
notifying all affected owners who had not signed the petition, by publication
in one newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality, fifteen days in
advance of the date set for the hearing.
   The same procedure, rules and regulations, shall apply in the case of
property owners protesting a change of zoning, except that the reasons for such
protest shall be clearly stated on the petition prior to its circulation.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1143.04 DECISION BY PLANNING COMMISSION AND COUNCIL.
   The Planning Commission may recommend that the change of zoning be approved
as requested, or the Commission may recommend that a change of zoning be made
other than that requested in the application and petition. This recommendation
shall be forwarded to Council. Council shall then hold a public hearing within
ninety days and take such action as it believes to be in the best interest of
the City.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1143.05 DISAPPROVAL; APPEAL TO COUNCIL.
   If the requested change of zoning is denied by the Planning Commission, any
person whose property is included in the proposed change, or who is affected by
a proposed change in text, may appeal to Council within twenty days of the time
that action was taken by the Commission denying the requested zoning change.
After Council has held a public hearing upon the application, it may overrule
the recommendation of the Commission, but only by a three-fourths vote of the
full membership of Council.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1143.06 DEPOSIT REQUIRED.
   Before any action is taken upon application as provided in this chapter
either by the Planning Commission or Council, the applicant shall deposit with
the Commission the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) to cover the approximate cost of
the procedure, and the Commission shall then deposit this amount with the City
Treasurer, where it shall be credited to the General Revenue Fund of the City.
The failure of either the Commission or Council to approve the change shall not
be construed as any reason for refunding the deposit to the applicant.
1143.07 AMENDMENT OF THE DISTRICT MAP.
   Not less than once a year following the effective date of Ordinance 24-66,
passed April 5, 1966, all district changes recommended by the Planning
Commission and established by ordinance of Council shall be incorporated into a
revision of the District Map and established by ordinance after required notice
and public hearing.

facilities adequate in area, design, arrangement and development to properly
serve the uses for which such facilities are intended and sufficient to
preclude the need for on- street parking or storage of automobiles or trucks.

1171.02 PROFESSIONAL HOME OCCUPATION.
   An office or studio shall be permitted in any residential district in the
home of a person practicing any of the following professions: architect,
engineer, lawyer, manufacturer's representative, sculptor, artist, author, real
estate broker, composer, musician, clergyman and teacher or tutor. Similar home
professional offices or studios and other home occupations of very light
intensity may be permitted upon determination by the Zoning Board of Appeals,
after a public notice and hearing, that such home occupation is sufficiently in
character with the surroundings or of such very light intensity that it
warrants approval as a professional home occupation.
1171.03 LIGHT HOME OCCUPATION.
   Light home occupations shall be permitted in R-A and R-S Districts in the
home of a resident. Light home occupations shall include the following:
dressmaker, seamstress, tailor, home laundry and ironing, office for insurance
agent, doctor and dentist office, office for selling or taking orders for
merchandise or services, day nursery for not more than four children, rooming
or boarding facility for not more than two persons by a resident owner.
Occupations similar in character and intensity of use to the above, and a
rooming or boarding facility for more than two persons may also be permitted,
but only as determined appropriate and reasonable by the Zoning Board of
Appeals after a public notice and hearing.
1171.04 HEAVY HOME OCCUPATION.
   Heavy home occupations may be permitted in R-A and R-S Districts in the home
of a resident upon approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals when determined
appropriate and reasonable, and may include the following uses: beauty shop and
barber shop, furniture, upholstery, small appliance, and similar repair shop,
tool sharpening and lawnmower repair shop, day nursery for more than four
children, headquarters for plumbing, furnace, electric, painting work and
similar uses, and occupations similar in character and intensity of use to the
above.
   The above listed home occupations may be approved by the Zoning Board of
Appeals in accord with the following conditions:
   (a)    A public notice has been given thirty days before hearing and a
public hearing held by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (b)    A determination has been made by the Zoning Board of Appeals that the
proposed home occupation will in no way be a detriment to the existing
character of the area in which it is proposed.
   (c)    A statement describing the proposed home occupation has been
circulated or mailed by the applicant to all property owners within 170 feet
from any lot line with a place on the statement for their name, address,
approval, disapproval or other comment; and such statement with approvals,
disapprovals and comments has been reviewed and considered by the Zoning Board
of Appeals.
1171.05 ZONING BOARD AUTHORITY TO EVALUATE AND DETERMINE HOME OCCUPATIONS.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the authority to evaluate and
determine whether the character or magnitude of any home occupation is such
that it may be classified or continued to be classified as a home occupation.
The Zoning Inspector shall in no case have the authority to grant a permit for
any home occupation other than as defined in this Zoning Code. All applications
or requests for home occupations which are not defined or are borderline cases
shall be considered and the classification determined by the Zoning Board of
Appeals after a public notice and hearing. In addition to the above, home
occupations which the Zoning Inspector determines should be considered as
possible heavy home occupations must meet the conditions listed under Section
 1171.04.

shall be engaged in a home occupation in any R-L, RL-2 and RL-3 District. No
person other than members of the family residing on the premises shall be
engaged in a home occupation in any other residential district unless approval
is granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals after a public notice and public
hearing, and then not more one such person shall be so approved.
   (b)    No sign shall be used in connection with a home occupation other than
one nonilluminated sign, not more than one square foot in area and mounted flat
against the outside wall of the principal building, nor shall any display be
used that will indicate from the exterior that the building is being utilized
in part for any purpose other than that of a dwelling.
   (c)    There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the building or
premises, or other visible evidence of the conduct of such home occupation,
other than the permitted sign, which would change the essential character
thereof as a dwelling.
   (d)    The space devoted for use of the home occupation must be within the
main dwelling or basement and shall occupy not more than 300 square feet.

than two customers, except as permitted for day nurseries, at any time.
   (f)    No wholesale, jobbing, or retail business shall be permitted unless
it is conducted entirely by mail or telephone, and does not involve the
receipt, delivery, sale of merchandise on or from the premises; provided,
however, that articles produced on the premises may be sold on the premises.

customers shall be parked in the driveway or along the street curb abutting the
premises, unless other more satisfactory arrangements are required or approved
by the Zoning Board of Appeals after a public notice and hearing. Home
occupation parking on noncurbed streets is prohibited. Not more than one three-
quarter ton truck or van may be used in connection with a home occupation
unless approval is granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals after a public notice
and public hearing.
1171.07 PERMIT.

1181.01 NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND.
   The lawful use of land existing on the effective date of Ordinance 24-66,
passed April 5, 1966, although such use does not conform to the provisions
hereof, may be continued for a period of not more than five years; provided,
however, that no such nonconforming use of land shall in any way be expanded or
extended either on the same or adjoining property. If such nonconforming use of
land or any portion thereof is discontinued or changed for a period of at least
one year, the future use of such land shall be in conformity with the
provisions of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1181.02 CONTINUATION OF EXISTING USES.
   The lawful use of a building or structure existing at the effective date of
Ordinance 24-66, passed April 5, 1966 may be continued, although such use does
not conform to the provisions hereof. If no structural alterations are made, a
nonconforming use of a building may be changed to another nonconforming use of
the same or of a more restricted classification. Whenever a nonconforming use
has been changed to a more restrictive use or to a conforming use, such use
shall not thereafter be changed to a less restricted use. The nonconforming use
of a building may be hereafter extended throughout those parts of a building
which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of the
enactment of Ordinance 24-66, passed April 5, 1966. (Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-
66.)
1181.03 EFFECT UPON CURRENT BUILDING.
   Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the plans,
construction, size or designated use of the building, structure or part
thereof, for which a building permit has been granted before the enactment or
amendment of Ordinance 24-66, passed April 5, 1966 by Council, and the
construction of which, from such plans, shall have been started within ninety
days of the date of enactment of Ordinance 24-66, passed April 5, 1966. If any
of the above requirements shall not have been fulfilled within the same time as
stated above, or if building operations are discontinued for a period of ninety
days, any further construction shall be in conformity with the provisions of
this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1181.04 NONCONFORMING USE CREATED BY ZONING CHANGES.
   Whenever the use of a building becomes a nonconforming use through a change
in the zoning ordinance or district boundaries, such use may be continued, and
if no structural alterations are made, it may be changed to another
nonconforming use of the same or of a more restricted classification.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1181.05 DISCONTINUANCE OF NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND USES.
   A nonconforming use of a building or portion thereof which is hereafter
discontinued for a continuous period of two years, shall not again be used,
except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which such
building is situated.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1181.06 DAMAGED NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS.
   No building which has been damaged by fire, explosions, act of God or the
public enemy to the extent of more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the fair
market value of the building immediately prior to damage, shall be restored
except in conformity with the regulations in this Zoning Code. If a building is
damaged by less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the fair market value, or,
in the case of a residential structure within an M-2 Heavy Industrial District,
if such structure is damaged to any extent, it may be repaired or reconstructed
and used as before the time of damage, provided that such repairs or
reconstruction is completed within twelve months of the date of such damage.
(Ord. 20-95. Passed 3-21-95.)
1181.07 SIGNS.
   Signs to be used in conjunction with a nonconforming business use in a
residential district shall be limited to a single wall sign. The location and
size of this sign must be approved by the Planning Commission but in no case
may it exceed thirty square feet in area.
(Ord. 24-66. Passed 4-5-66.)
1181.08 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   Existing signs which were constructed in accordance with all applicable
regulations in effect at the time of construction may remain or be
reconstructed at the same location and be of the same size, provided they are
continually maintained in accordance with Section
1184.18.
(Ord. 11-86. Passed 3-4-86.)
1181.09 NONCONFORMING MOBILE HOMES.
   Notwithstanding any provision of Chapter 1181 hereinbefore or hereinafter
contained, mobile homes in any district, except M-2 Heavy Industrial Districts,
used for residential purposes as of May 5, 1966, may, for residential purposes
only, remain at the same premises on which they were located on such date, may
for residential purposes only, be expanded on the premises by constructing
additions and improvements thereto or may, for residential purposes only, be
replaced on the premises with another mobile home of the same size or a larger
size; provided, however, that should the use of any such mobile home for
residential purposes permitted by this section be discontinued for a period of
six months, then the premises on which such mobile home was being used for
residential purposes shall no longer be used for any purposes by a mobile home,
and any unoccupied mobile home remaining on the premises after the expiration
date of the six month period shall be removed from the premises within thirty
days after the expiration date of the six month period, and thereafter shall be
located in conformance with City zoning regulations.
   All nonconforming mobile home replacements and all additions and
improvements to nonconforming mobile homes, made pursuant to the provisions of
this section, shall meet all yard requirements of the zoning district in which
such nonconforming mobile home is located.
(Ord. 49-67. Passed 8-15-67.)
1181.10 NONCONFORMING USE CREATED BY ABANDONMENT OF LAWFUL, CONFORMING USE.
   If a lawful, conforming use is abandoned and compliance with the existing
zoning provisions is highly impracticable or would create a substantial
hardship, Council may, as an alternative to changing the zoning classification,
grant permission for the creation of a nonconforming use, under the following
terms and conditions.
   (a)   Applicant must show compliance with applicable zoning provisions is
highly impracticable or would create a substantial hardship.
   (b)   No permit for the creation of a nonconforming use shall be issued
until after a public hearing, before Council, with thirty days’ public notice,
and ten days’ notice of said hearing by certified mail given to all adjoining
property owners.
   (c)   The permitted nonconforming use shall only be that which Council
specifically designates and such may not be changed or expanded.
   (d)   Any cessation of use of more than sixty days or any change or
expansion of the use permitted will result in an automatic termination of the
permit granted under this section.
   (e)   The initial term of any use permitted under this section shall be five
years. Such use may be renewed for periods of five years, but only after a
public hearing before Council to determine that the permittee has complied with
the provisions of this section.
   (f)   The authority to conduct a nonconforming use permitted by this section
may not be transferred without the approval of Council.
   (g)   In granting a permit for the creation of a nonconforming use, Council
may impose such additional conditions as it deems necessary and appropriate and
in the best interests of the area in which the proposed nonconforming use is
located.

have the sign copy covered or removed within thirty days after written
notification from the code official; and upon failure to comply with such
notice, the code official is hereby authorized to cause removal of such sign
copy, and any expense incident thereto shall be paid by the owner of the
building, structure or ground on which the sign is located.
   (i)    Nonconforming Signs. Any sign legally existing at the time of the

continue in such status until such time as it is either abandoned or removed by
its owner, subject to the following limitations:
      (1)   Structural alterations, enlargement or re-erection are permissible
only where such alterations will not increase the degree of nonconformity of
the signs.
      (2)   Any legal nonconforming sign shall be removed or rebuilt without

1189.01 LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE AND DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the placement,
construction and modification of wireless communications facilities and their
support structures in order to promote and protect the public health, safety,
morals, comfort, prosperity and general welfare, while at the same time not
unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless
telecommunications market place in the City. Specifically, the purposes of this
chapter are:
      (1)   To direct the location of various types of towers and wireless
telecommunications facilities into appropriate areas of the City.
      (2)   To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and wireless telecommunications facilities.
      (3)   To minimize adverse visual impacts of towers and wireless
telecommunications facilities through careful design, siting, landscaping and
innovative camouflaging techniques.
      (4)   To promote and encourage share use/co-location of towers and
antenna support structures as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single-use towers.
      (5)   To avoid potential damages to adjacent properties caused by towers
and wireless telecommunications facilities by ensuring that such structures are
soundly designed, constructed and modified, are appropriately maintained, and
are fully removed upon any cessation of operation.
      (6)   To the greatest extent feasible, ensure that towers and wireless
telecommunications facilities are compatible with surrounding land uses.
      (7)   To the greatest extent feasible, ensure that towers and wireless
telecommunications facilities are designed in harmony with natural settings and
in a manner consistent with current development patterns.
   (b)   Definitions.

in Section
1189.02 .
      (7)   “Height” means, when referring to a tower or other structure, the
distance from ground level to the highest point on the tower or other
structure, even if said highest point is an antenna.
      (8)   “Personal wireless services” means commercial mobile services,
unlicensed wireless services and common carrier wireless exchange access
services, including cellular services.
      (9)   “Site” means a tract, lot or parcel of land that contains the
cellular or wireless communications tower, antenna, support structure(s),
parking and any other uses associated with and ancillary to cellular or
wireless communications transmission.
      (10)   “Support structure” means any building or structure accessory to,
but necessary for telecommunication.
      (11)   “Telecommunications facilities” means the towers, antenna,
alternate tower structures, support structures, cables, wires and other
equipment necessary for telecommunication.
      (12)   “Tower” means any structure that is designed and constructed
primarily for the purpose of support one or more antennas, including self-
supporting lattice towers, guy towers or monopole towers. The term includes
radio and television transmission towers, microwave towers, common-carrier
towers, cellular telephone tower, alternative tower structures, and the like.

1189.02 APPLICABILITY.
   All towers, antenna support structures, and wireless telecommunications
facilities, any portion of which are located within the City, are subject to
this chapter. Except as provided in this chapter, any use being made of an
existing tower or antenna support structure on the effective date of the
ordinance enacting this chapter shall be deemed a non-conforming structure and
allowed to continue, even in conflict with the terms of this chapter. Any tower
site that has received approval in the form of a building permit by the City,
but has not yet been constructed or located, shall be considered a
nonconforming structure so long as such approval is current and not expired.
Applicants for telecommunication and utility permits, or renewals thereof,
shall file an application therefor in such form as the Director of Safety may
require along with a nonrefundable application fee of one thousand dollars
($1,000). The Director of Safety shall determine if the application is in order
and, if so, forward the application to Council to determine whether or not, in
accordance with the criteria set forth in Section
1189.04 , the applicant should be granted a permit hereunder. Council shall
make a final determination as to whether or not such permit should be granted
and, if so, upon what terms and conditions.
(Ord. 24-99. Passed 3-2-99.)
1189.03 INVENTORY OF EXISTING SITES.
   Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide the Building
Division of the City an inventory of its existing towers that are within the
City including specific information about the location, height, and design of
each tower. The City may share such information with other applicants applying
for permits under this chapter or other organizations seeking to locate
antennas within the City, provided, however, that the City is not, by sharing
such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are
available or suitable.
(Ord. 24-99. Passed 3-2-99.)
1189.04 STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO ALL WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
   Telecommunications and utility and special permits shall be granted based
upon a determination that the following criteria are met:
   (a)   The granting of the permit will contribute to the public health,
safety or welfare in the City;
   (b)   The granting of the permit will be consistent with the policy of the
City as set forth in Section 
1189.01 ;
   (c)   That the applicant is a proper person to hold a permit and will
fulfill all its obligations hereunder.
      (Ord. 24-99. Passed 3-2-99.)
1189.05 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   (a)   All wireless telecommunications facilities and support structures
shall be certified by an Engineer licensed in the State of Ohio to be
structurally sound and, at a minimum, in conformance with the Ohio Building
Code. Proof of on-going compliance shall be provided to the Director of Safety
every ten years by way of an inspection report prepared by an Ohio licensed
structural engineer indicating the structural integrity of the tower. The
communications company must demonstrate to the City that it is licensed by the

            (Ord. 51-05. Passed 6-7-05.)
1191.05  DESIGN GUIDELINES/DEMOLITION CRITERIA.
   (a)    Preface. The purpose of these guidelines is to preserve the
architectural history of existing buildings or structures and to ensure the
procedures and materials used are compatible with the existing building or
structure and help to ensure its preservation into the future and are meant to
give architects and owners design direction consistent with the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Ashland. In principle, the Board adopts the United
States of America, Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation.
      (1)   Preservation/rehabilitation/renovation. With respect to
preservation/rehabilitation/renovation generally it is the interest of the
Board that buildings within the Historic District be preserved, thus
maintaining the character of the Historic District. Consistent with the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior, Standards of Rehabilitation, the intent of these
guidelines is to preserve and restore the features which establish a building's
architectural character while making alterations and renovations necessary for
the efficient and contemporary use of the building. The rehabilitation process
assumes that some alterations may be necessary to meet the needs of the
building owner and goveming codes. Such alterations should be done so as not to
destroy the materials and features which help to define a building's historic,
cultural and/or architectural character. The historic materials, features and/
or craftsmanship are important in defining the building character and should be
retained, protected, and repaired when possible.
   When the preservation of architectural features is not possible, alterations
should be done in a manner respectful of the existing character, but done in a
manner that is representative of architectural design and construction of
contemporary times.
      (2)   Additions/new construction. With respect to additions/new
construction to existing buildings and all new buildings or structures it is
generally the interest of the Board that such additions/new construction shall
be designed to enhance the character of the Historic District. Consistent with
the preface of these Guidelines, new buildings and additions should be
representative of architectural design and construction of contemporary times.
   Additions to existing buildings in the Historic District should be designed
so as not to detract from the original character of the building. Whenever
possible, additions should be located away from the primary or street face of
the building. The addition should be designed so as not to destroy existing
architectural features where feasible, such that the addition should able to be
removed and the building restored to its original condition.
   New buildings in the Historic District should be designed to be compatible
with other structures in the Historic District while still reflecting work of
contemporary times.
   To be compatible, a new building should incorporate some of the existing
architectural design characteristics of the Historic District. Proximity of
existing buildings to the new building will affect the latitude in design
constraints. An infill design should be more consistent with adjoining
buildings than a freestanding structure.
      (3)   Demolition. With respect to demolition it is the interest of the
Board that buildings within the Historic District be preserved and renovated
for economically productive uses. Consistent with this intent, the Board also
realizes the Historic District is not a static environment, but an ever
changing and developing entity.
   Applications for demolition will be reviewed based on the overall impact the
demolition will have to the Historic District and the community.
   The Board encourages the saving of the Historic District and history of the
City. "Demolition of any building or structure which would detract from the
Historic District or result in a loss of historically significant qualities
will be strongly discouraged. In reviewing an application, the Board will also
look at the proposed new use of the site and how the new use will impact the
Historic District. Demolition of existing buildings which are not a significant
loss to the Historic District to allow for the construction of new buildings
which enhance the Historic District is acceptable and may be encouraged by the
Board.
   Demolition shall include "demolition by neglect," which shall mean neglect
in the maintenance, repair or security of a site, building or structure,
resulting in any of the following conditions:
         A.   The deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports;
         B.   The deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members;
         C.   The deterioration of exterior chimneys;
         D.   The deterioration of exterior plaster or mortar;
         E.   The ineffective weatherproofing of exterior walls, roofs and
foundations, including broken windows and doors; or
         F.   The serious deterioration of any documented exterior
architectural feature or significant landscape feature which in the judgment of
the Commission produces a detrimental effect upon the character of the
district.
   (b)    New Construction Guidelines. The purpose of this section is to define
the architectural principles and elements which the Historic Preservation Board
will use to review the design of new construction within the Historic District.
      (1)   Additions. The proposed addition must fulfill the following
requirements to be acceptable:
         A.    Additions should be designed to preserve significant historic
materials and features and minimize the damage or loss of significant materials
and craftsmanship such as, but not limited to, pressed brick, decorative
marble, stone, terra-cotta, or architectural metal.
         B.    Alterations to primary elevations and features which distinguish
the building should be avoided. These features include, but are not limited to,
window patterns, shutters, porticos, entrances, doorways, roof shapes, cornices
decorative moldings, or glazing.
         C.    Additions should preserve the historic character and be
compatible in size, scale, form, color, material and character so not to
visually overpower or distract from the original building.
         D.    Additions should protect the historical significance and be
readily distinguishable from older work, but the new work should be harmonious
with the old work as defined in subsection (b)(l)B. hereof. Plan the new
addition so it provides some differentiation in architectural design
characteristics.
      2.    Infill structures. The construction of proposed new infill
buildings on vacant lots in the Historic District is encouraged. Such infill
buildings should fulfill the following criteria:
         A.    The new building should be designed to be compatible with the
surrounding buildings. It should look as part of the whole.
         B.    The new building should look new, using material and methodology
appropriate to today's architecture. The design should not pretend to mimic
historic styles, but should be sensitive to the character of its neighbors.
         C.    The use of pseudo-historic details and elements should be
avoided because it detracts from the Historic District by compromising the
truly historic character of the Historic District.
         D.    Good infill buildings are compatible with many of the design
characteristics of the surrounding buildings and structures. Some of the
following design characteristics of the infill building should be reflective of
its neighbors:
            1.    Massing.
            2.    Scale.
            3.    Proportion.
            4.    Orientation.
            5.    Materials.
            6.    Form.
            7.    Pattern/rhythm.
            8.    Color.
      (3)   Freestanding structures. The freestanding building has the greatest
latitude in design character to still be compatible with the character the
Historic District. The new building should be reflective of the tradition of
the Historic District. The proposed new freestanding building must fulfill the
following requirements to be acceptable:
         A.    Quality of design, materials and craftsmanship reflect the pride
we hold for the Historic District and its individual buildings. New buildings
which are representatives of quality design and use materials in character with
the Historic District make a positive contribution to the Historic District.
         B.    The use of infill design concepts such as rhythm, proportion,
building form, and materials establishes a consistency between the existing
Historic District and the new building.
         C.    The new building should interact with pedestrians and the public
space in a manner consistent to the character of the Historic District.
   (c)   Demolition Guidelines. The Board shall review all applications to
demolish or move buildings or structures for the effects of the proposed action
on the City.
      (1)   If the Board finds the proposed action will have no detrimental
effect on the continued historic architectural character of the area and is in
keeping with the intent and purposes of this chapter, the application shall be
approved.
      (2)   If the Board finds demolition or removal will have detrimental
effects on the City, approval may not be given for a period of up to sixty
days. During this period, the Board shall review the following:
         A.    Alternative uses for the building or structure;
         B.    Condition of the building;
         C.    Potential return on investment by rehabilitation and use of the
building on the existing site;
         D.    Efforts by owners to secure profitable new owners or lessees for
the building; and
         E.    Impact of demolition or removal on adjoining structures and the
integrity of the area as a whole, including proposed new structures on the
vacated site.
      (3)   At the end of the sixty-day period, or any extension mutually
agreed upon by the City and the owner, the City of Ashland or any other public
or private body shall either make a bona-fide purchase or lease offer for the
building or structure, or the application for the demolition or moving shall be
approved by the Board. (Ord. 51-05. Passed 6-7-05.)
1191.06 DESIGNATION CRITERIA FOR HISTORIC DISTRICTS OR LANDMARKS.
   In considering the designation of any place, building, structure, work of
art, or similar object in the City as a historic district or landmark, the
Historic Preservation Board shall apply the following criteria with respect to
such property.

1333.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Ashland, State of Ohio, does
ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Ashland has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Ashland as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas
of special flood hazard annexed by City of Ashland.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For purposes
of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Ashland County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Ashland County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective August 18, 2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Ashland as required by Section
1333.04 (c).
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City Engineering Office, 206 Claremont Avenue
Ashland, Ohio.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Ashland, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 43-09.
Passed 6-16-09.)
1333.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure: A structure on the same lot with, and of a nature
customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal: A request for review of the floodplain administrator’s
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.

exceeded in any give year. The base flood may also be referred to as the 1%
chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE): The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   Development: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of
equipment or materials.
   (g)   Enclosure Below the Lowest Floor: See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management): Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill: A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means:
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM): Usually the initial map, produced by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zones AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation: The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is
the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one-half (0.5) foot
at any point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structures: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Ashland’s historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
“manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle”. For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park: As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27- 01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP): The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction: Structures for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Ashland Flood
Insurance Rate Map, January 2, 1980, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (aa)   Person: Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio Revised Code
Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not
limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society,
council, institution, state college or university, community college district,
technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not
include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle: A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but
as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal
use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of date including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Ashland’s flood maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1333.01 (f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.  
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1333.04 (c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Ashland, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Ashland have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Ashland’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Ashland
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Ashland suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the City of Ashland has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1333.05 .
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevation or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.  
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one-half (0.5) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one-half (0.5) foot increase in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one-half (0.5) foot or less of the base flood elevation and an
explanation why these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B., items 1. and 3-5.
      (3)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its bank. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Ashland specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1333.03 (j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.

         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items subsection (d)(2)A. to K. have been
fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.  
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Ashland County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.

            (Ord. 21-16. Passed 3-16-16.)
1351.09 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization). The SWP3 shall identify all subcontractors engaged in
activities that could impact storm water runoff. The SWP3 shall contain
signatures from all of the identified subcontractors indicating that they have
been informed and understand their roles and responsibilities in complying with
the SWP3.
   The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)    Non-structural Preservation Measures: The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)    Erosion Control Practices: The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to stabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
      Erosion control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
Table 1: Permanent Stabilization
 
Area Requiring Permanent Stabilization  Time Frame to Apply Erosion Controls
Any area that will lie dormant for one  Within 7 days of the most recent

Disturbed areas that will be idle over
winter.
Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural instability or
are otherwise unobtainable, alternate stabilization techniques must be
employed.
      (2)    Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide available at
www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)    Runoff Control Practices. The SWP3 shall incorporate measures that
control the flow of runoff from disturbed areas so as to prevent erosion. Such
practices may include rock check dams, pipe slope drains, diversions to direct
flow away from exposed soils and protective grading practices. These practices
shall divert runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable.
   (d)    Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)    Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven (7) days from
the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is stabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)    Sediment settling ponds. A sediment settling pond, or equivalent
best management practice upon approval from the City Engineer, is required for
any one of the following conditions, as determined in Table 3 below:
         A.    Concentrated storm water runoff.
         B.    Runoff from drainage areas that exceeds the design capacity of
silt fence or inlet protection.
         C.    Runoff from common drainage locations with 10-acres of disturbed
land.
The sediment-settling pond shall provide both a sediment storage zone and a
dewatering zone. The volume of the dewatering zone shall be at least 67 cubic
yards (1,800 cubic feet) of storage per acre of total contributing drainage
area and have a minimum of 48-hour drain time for sediment basins serving a
drainage area over 5 acres. If feasible, dewatering shall occur at the pond
surface using a skimmer or equivalent device.
The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be calculated by one of the
following methods:
         A.    The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be 1000 cubic feet
per disturbed acre within the watershed of the basin.
         B.    The volume of the sediment storage zone shall be the volume
necessary to store the sediment as calculated with a generally accepted erosion
prediction model.
When determining the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas
which remain undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless
runoff from these areas is diverted away from the sediment settling pond and is
not comingled with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the dewatering zone must
be less than or equal to five (5) feet. The configuration between the inlets
and the outlet of the basin must provide at least two units of length for each
one unit of width (> 2:1 length:width ratio), however a length to width ration
of 4:1 is recommended. Sediment must be removed from the sediment-settling pond
when the design capacity has been reduced by 40 percent. This limit is
typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth. When
designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider public safety,
especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the sediment basin
and alternative sediment controls must be used where site limitations would
preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment and erosion
control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
      (3)    Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to 10 acres. Placing silt fence in parallel does not extend the permissible
drainage area to the silt fence.
Table 3: Silt Fence Maximum Drainage Area Based on Slope
 
Maximum Drainage Area (in acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a Particular
Linear Feet of Silt Fence               Drainage Area (in percent)
0.5                                     < 2%
0.25                                    2% but < 20%
0.125                                   20% but < 50%
      (4)    Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems, unless the storm drain system drains to a
sediment settling pond. All inlets receiving runoff from drainage areas of one
or more acres will require a sediment settling pond. Straw or hay bales are not
acceptable forms of inlet protection.
      (5)    Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.    Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the
only permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These
entrances shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled
concrete or cement sized greater than 2" in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.    Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and
receiving traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned daily to remove
sediment tracked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets
nearest to the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly. Based on
site conditions, The City Engineer may require additional best management
practices to control off site tracking and dust. These additional BMPs may
include:
         C.    Silt fence or construction fence installed around the perimeter
of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
         D.    Designated wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these areas must
be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or to a
sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1351.09 (g) of this regulation.
         E.    Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The City Engineer may require dust
controls including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping
stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the
speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)    Surface Waters of the State protection. Construction vehicles
shall avoid water resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to
disturb areas within 50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following
conditions shall be addressed in the SWP3:
         A.    All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.    Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.    No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetland.
         D.    Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.    Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.    Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control
structures shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or
close to the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough,
slip, or erode.
      (7)    Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)    Non-sediment Pollutant Controls: No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      A.    Waste Materials: A covered Dumpster shall be made available for the
proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other waste
materials.
      B.    Concrete Truck Wash Out: The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      C.    Fuel/Liquid Tank Storage: All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all
containers in the storage area.
      D.    Toxic or Hazardous Waste Disposal: Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      E.    Contaminated Soils Disposal and Runoff: Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)    Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)    Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)    Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one-half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The inspection frequency
may be reduced to at least once every month if the entire site is temporarily
stabilized or runoff is unlikely due to weather conditions (e.g., site is
covered with snow, ice, or the ground is frozen). A waiver of inspection
requirements is available until one month before thawing conditions are
expected to result in a discharge if prior written approval has been attained
from the City Engineer and all of the following conditions are met:
      A.    The project is located in an area where frozen conditions are
anticipated to continue for extended periods of time (i.e. more than one (1)
month).
      B.    Land disturbance activities have been suspended, and temporary
stabilization is achieved.
      C.    The beginning date and ending dates of the waiver period are
documented in the SWP3.
The applicant shall assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these
inspections to ensure that the control practices are functional and to evaluate
whether the SWP3 is adequate, or whether additional control measures are
required. Qualified inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and
experience in the installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion
controls.
      These inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)    Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)    Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form acceptable to the City Engineer.
         The inspection form shall include:
         A.    The inspection date.
         B.    Names, titles and qualifications of personnel making the
inspection.
         C.    Weather information for the period since the last inspection,
including a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of
each storm event and approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event in
inches, and whether any discharges occurred.
         D.    Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of inspection.
         E.    Locations of:
            1.    Discharges of sediment or other pollutants from site.
            2.    BMPs that need to be maintained.
            3.    BMPs that failed to operate as designed or prove inadequate
for a particular location.
            4.    Where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist at the
time of inspection.
         F.    Corrective action required including any necessary changes to
the SWP3 and implementation dates.
      (3)    Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)    Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)    The applicant shall maintain for three (3) years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
non-compliance determined by these inspections.
   (i)   Maintenance. The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the City Engineer.
When inspections reveal the need for repair, replacement, or installation of
erosion and sediment control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)    When practices require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment-settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three (3) days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds
must be repaired or maintained within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (2)    When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate
control practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control
practice must be installed within ten (10) days of the inspection.
      (3)    When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten (10) days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection
reveals that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must
contain a statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not
needed.
   (j)    Final Stablization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
City Engineer. Once a definable area has achieved final stabilization, the
applicant may note this on the SWP3 and no further inspection requirement
applies to that portion of the site.
