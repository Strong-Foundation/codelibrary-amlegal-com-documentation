PRELIMINARY UNIT
   EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even- numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code. Exceptions are the Traffic and
General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter
in each Code or are included as part of the sections. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062 and 660.063
follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio Legislature through inaction has elected to
observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.
   There are no sections in Chapter 204. This chapter has been established to
provide a place for cross references and any future legislation.

 Credit Card Policy
208.01   Overview.

208.03   Procedures and policy.
208.01 OVERVIEW.
   This Credit Card Policy sets forth the Village of Greenwich guidelines that
will be applied to all employees who are using a Village of Greenwich credit
card. This policy conveys Village expectations and procedures for the issuance,
application, use, safeguarding, payment, and termination of the Village credit
card issued to Village employees. Cardholders and their supervisors are
responsible for ensuring that they adhere to this Credit Card Policy, thereby
taking appropriate measures to minimize the risk of fraudulent or corrupt
credit card use. The credit card is meant to allow employees access to
efficient, flexible, and alternative means of payment for approved expenses.
(Ord. 2018-04. Passed - - )
208.02 ELIGIBILITY AND APPROVAL.
   (a)   Eligibility. Village maintains a credit card program for full-time
employees who will regularly incur business expenses. In order to be eligible,
the employee must travel frequently in the course of his/her duties, travel
overseas in the course of his/her duties, purchase significant volumes on minor
goods and services for use by the Village, or frequently incur other business-
related expenses of a kind appropriately paid by credit card.
   (b)   Approval. Eligible employees as designated by the Village, should
contact the Fiscal Officer, the Plan Administrator, who will handle all
arrangements for obtaining Village credit cards. Based on the needs of the
business, the Village will offer eligible employees a Village credit card to
use for approved expenses.
(Ord. 2018-04. Passed - - )
208.03 PROCEDURES AND POLICY.
   (a)   Use and Financial Responsibilities. The employee agrees to comply with
all the applicable policies and procedures of the Village and this Credit Card
Policy. The Villages credit card is to be used ONLY for official business
expenditures, not personal expenses. The cardholder is responsible for ensuring
that the credit card purchases are within budget and properly approved. The
Village will pay for the total balance by the payment due date each month for
each company-approved charge by the cardholder.
   (b)   Credit Spending Limits. The credit limit has yet to be determined.
   (c)   Credit Card Statements. Corporate credit card statements and
expenditures must be sent to the appropriate agent at the Village for review.
If the credit card expenditures are not received within one month of the
statement due date, a reminder will be sent of their obligations under this
policy. Continued or repeated non-conformance to this Policy can result in
cancellation of the card and/or such other actions as appropriate.
   (d)   Receipts and Expense Reports. Cardholders must maintain physical proof
of each credit transaction with the corporate card and provide an itemized
receipt when practicable. A failure to provide receipts or credible explanation
for any transactions could result in a debit from the cardholder's salary,
forfeiture of right of reimbursement, and other disciplinary action. Credible
transactions should contain the following information when appropriate: date of
purchase, vendor name and address, quantity, unit price, grand total of
expenditures. When applicable, written notation should supplement the receipts
with the following information: the business purpose and names of persons in
attendance, including their professional titles or affiliation. Expenses must
be submitted within thirty days from the time expense was incurred. Expense
reports submitted outside of this time frame will not be reimbursed.
   (e)   Credit Card Violations and Consequences. Credit card violations may
include, but are not limited to, obtaining cash advances or for other expenses
than those incurred by the assigned employee named on the card, charging
personal transactions to the corporate credit card, allowing unauthorized users
to use the corporate credit card, exceeding the credit card limit, failing to
promptly return the credit card when a cardholder is reassigned, terminated, or
any terms determined at the discretion of the Village. Cardholder transactions
will be scrutinized to ensure compliance with this policy. Infractions of the
conditions of this policy, or to any Village policy that may apply to this
Credit Card Policy, could result in cancellation of the card and withdrawal of
credit card privileges. Breaching of this policy may result in disciplinary
action against the employee up to and including termination. In all cases of
breach, the Village will consider the facts and circumstances of each incident,
and will take action as deemed appropriate. The Village reserves the right to
recover any monetary considerations from the cardholder. Internal and external
audits of cardholder purchases may be carried out from time to time at the
discretion of the Village.
   (f)   Ownership and Cancellation of the Credit Card. The credit card may not
be transferred or assigned to anyone other than the designated cardholder. The
designated cardholder is accountable for all activity on the credit card. The
Village may suspend or cancel cardholder privileges at any time for any reason.
The cardholder will forfeit the credit card upon request to the Village or any
authorized agent of the card issuer. The credit card will be returned to the
Village upon any notification of resignation and the cardholder must reconcile
all expenditures on the credit card since the last credit card statement. It is
the responsibility of the departing cardholder to ensure that the account is
settled prior to departure.
   (g)   Disputed Items. It is the cardholder's responsibility to follow-up on
any erroneous charges, returns, or adjustments to ensure proper credit is given
on subsequent statements. Disputed transactions must be resolved with the card
issuer and the bank by the cardholder. The cardholder must notify the bank
immediately for resolution and the appropriate agent at the Village should be
informed as well.
   (h)   Protecting the Credit Card. Lost or stolen cards must be reported
immediately to the appropriate agent at the Village. The appropriate agent must
be notified within two business days of this activity, or in the instance of
loss or theft while conducting business overseas, must be notified within two
business days of returning to the official place of business.
   (i)   Safekeeping. Newly issued cards should be signed immediately by the
cardholder upon receipt. When using the card for approved internet
transactions, care should be taken that the site utilizes recognized encryption
technology. Card numbers should not be saved or stored in online accounts. When
the corporate credit card has expired and/or cardholder has received a new
corporate credit card, the cardholder should cut the card in half and discard
it. Cardholder should make certain that the card is returned to them, if being
used by an employee that has been authorize to use it on behalf of the card
holder after each charge and verify that the receipts are in hand.
   (j)   Contact Information. For any issues, comments, or questions regarding
this Credit Card Policy, please contact Village of Greenwich at 45 Main Street,
Greenwich, OH 44837 at mayor@villageofgreenwich.com.

252.07 GUIDELINES FOR RECORDKEEPING AND COMPILATION OF INFORMATION FOR HOURS
WORKED AND OVERTIME.
   The following guidelines shall govern Village employees:
   (a)   The work week for full time employees is a regularly recurring period
of 168 hours in the form of seven consecutive twenty-four hour periods. A work
week shall be Saturday through Friday.
   (b)   The pay period for all Village employees consists of two consecutive
work weeks.
   (c)   Extra pay at a rate of one and one-half times the employee's regular
hourly base rate will be granted for time beyond the normal forty hours worked.
All employees "comp" time is one and one-half time the hourly rate of pay.
"Hours worked" includes all time that an employee is required to be on duty, or
on the employer's premises, or at a prescribed work place for the employer, and
all time during which the employee is suffered or permitted to work for the
employer. Excluded from hours worked are sick leave, holidays, vacations and
personal leave. An employee will not be entitled to extra pay/comp time unless
authorized in advance by the employee's supervisor. For the Chief of Police,
Village Administrator and fiscal officer, the supervisor is the Mayor.
   (d)   Periods during which a Village employee is completely relieved from
duty and may leave the job, and which are long enough to enable the employee to
use the time effectively for his or her own purposes, are not hours worked.
   (e)   When an employee is called out on a job assignment, employee will be
paid a minimum of two hours pay.
   (f)   In order to comply with FLSA requirements, the Village will use a form
of time-management when feasible. With such a plan, the Village may lay off an
employee for a sufficient number of hours during some other week of the pay
period so that the desired wage for the pay period covers the total amount of
compensation, including the overtime compensation, due the employee for each
work week taken separately. Use of a time-management plan by the Village does
not permit the average of work hours between work weeks.
      (1)   All salaried "exempt" employees may accumulate "comp time" for
hours worked above forty hours during any week. "Comp time" may be accumulated
up to a maximum of eighty hours.
         A.   All requests for the use of "comp time" shall be made to the
employee supervisor. No comp time will be permitted unless approved by the
supervisor. Approval of the use of "comp time" shall be at the sound discretion
of the supervisor. The supervisor shall deny or limit the use of "comp time" if
its use may create practical difficulties or undue hardship to Village
operations resulting in significant difficulty or expense.
         B.   Any "comp time" accumulated above eighty hours shall be
forfeited.
      (2)   Village Administrator. If the Village Administrator has not
utilized "comp time" within ninety days of the end of the pay period in which
the "comp time" is earned, then the unused "comp time" shall be paid to the
employee as provided for in subsection (c) hereof.
      (3)   Chief of Police. If the Chief of Police has not utilized "comp
time" within ninety days of the end of the pay period in which the "comp time"
is earned, then the unused "comp time" shall be paid to the employee as
provided for in subsection (c) hereof
      (4)   Fiscal Officer. It may be impossible to require the Fiscal Officer
to be laid off during the same pay period in which "comp time" is earned. Thus,
the Fiscal Officer may accumulate "comp time" which must be used within ninety
days of the end of the pay period in which the "comp time" is earned. Any
unused "comp time" shall be forfeited if not used within ninety days of
accumulation.
   (g)   In order to use the time-management plan, all Village employees,
excluding exempt employees, will have their salary converted to an hourly wage.
(The total salary of an employee divided by 2,080 hours will yield the
employee's hourly rate.)
   (h)   Certain records must be kept in accordance with the FLSA. Employers
are required to keep records on wages, hours and other items listed in the
recordkeeping regulations (29 C.F.R., Part 156). Records of the required
information must be preserved for three years. Some supplementary items, such
as time cards, piecework tickets and order and shipping records, need be kept
for only two years. Some of the specific recordkeeping items required by Part
156 are the following:
      (1)   The name of the employee in full;
      (2)   His or her home address, including the zip code;
      (3)   His or her date of birth, if he or she is under nineteen;
      (4)   His or her sex and occupation;
      (5)   The time of day and the day of the week on which the employee's
work week begins;
      (6)   The regular hourly rate of pay in any work week in which an
overtime premium is due, and the basis of the wage payment (such as "$5.00/
hr.," "$40.00/day," "$200.00/wk. plus five percent commission").
      (7)   The daily and weekly hours of work;
      (8)   The total daily or weekly straight-time earnings;
      (9)   The total overtime compensation for the work week;
      (10)   The total additions to or deductions from wages paid;
      (11)   The total wages paid each pay period; and
      (12)   The date of payment and the pay period covered by such payment.
   (i)   The Village will display the minimum wage poster, WH Publication 1088,
where Village employees may readily see it.

   (b)   The Village may adopt a policy, by ordinance or resolution, pursuant
to R.C. § 3.061(B) to allow for the use of an employee dishonesty and faithful
performance of duty policy, rather than a surety bond that would otherwise be
required by law.
(Ord. 2023-15. Passed 12-5-23.)
252.10 STANDARD MILEAGE RATE.
   (a)   The standard mileage rate as allowed by the Internal Revenue Service

vehicle for official village business.
   (b)   All mileage submitted for reimbursement must be in writing and
approved in writing by the Mayor.
(Ord. 997. Passed 1-2-07.)
252.11 RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS PROHIBITED; EXCEPTIONS.
   (a)   As used in this section:

resolution, that requires any individual employed by that political
subdivision, as a condition of employment, to reside either in the county where
the political subdivision is located or in any adjacent county in this State.
For purposes of this section, an initiative petition shall be filed and
considered as provided in Ohio R.C. 731.28 and 731.31, except that the Fiscal
Officer of the political subdivision shall take the actions prescribed for the
Auditor or Clerk if the political subdivision has no Auditor or Clerk, and
except that references to a municipal corporation shall be considered to be
references to the applicable political subdivision.
   (d)   Except as otherwise provided in division (c), employees of political
subdivisions of this State have the right to reside any place they desire.

(Ord. 683. Passed 12-2-80.)
274.06 PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
   It is the policy of this office that openness lends to a better informed
citizenry, which leads to better government and better public policy. It is the
policy of this office to strictly adhere to the State's Public Records Act. All
exemptions to openness are to be construed in their narrowest sense, and any
denial of public records in response to a valid request must be accompanied by
an explanation, including legal authority, as outlined in the Ohio Revised
Code. If the request is in writing, the explanation must also be in writing.
   (a)   Public Records.
      (1)   This office, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines
“records” as including the following: Any document – paper, electronic,
including but not limited to e-mail, or other format – that is created or
received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that documents
the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or
other activities of the office. All records of this office are public unless
they are specifically exempt from disclosure under the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   It is the policy of this office that, as required by Ohio law,
records will be organized and maintained so that they are readily available for
inspection and copying. See division (d) of this section for the e-mail record
policy. Record retention schedules are to be updated regularly and posted
prominently.
   (b)   Record Requests. Each request for public records should be evaluated
for a response using the following guidelines:
      (1)   Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requester must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the records custodian must contact
the requester for clarification, and should assist the requester in revising
the request by informing the requester of the manner in which the office keeps
its records.
      (2)   The requester does not have to put a records request in writing,
and does not have to provide his or her identity or the intended use of the
requested public record. It is this office's general policy that this
information is not to be requested.
      (3)   Public records are to be available for inspection during regular
business hours, with the exception of published holidays. Public records must
be made available for inspection promptly. Copies of public records must be
made available within a reasonable period of time. “Prompt” and “reasonable”
take into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the
location where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review
of the records requested.
      (4)   A.   Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of
time required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include but are
not limited to meeting minutes, both in draft and final form, budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, etc. If fewer than 20
pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available in an
electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should be
made as quickly as the equipment allows.
         B.   All requests for public records most either be satisfied as set
forth in division (b)(4)A. of this section, or be acknowledged in writing by
the public office within three business days following the office's receipt of
the request. If a request is deemed significantly beyond “routine,” such as
seeking a voluminous number of copies or requiring extensive research, the
acknowledgment must include the following:
            1.   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy
the request.
            2.   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
            3.   Any items within the request that may be exempt from
disclosure.
      (5)   Any denial of public records requested must include an explanation,
including legal authority. If portions of a record are public and portions are
exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the rest released. If there
are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation,
including legal authority.
   (c)   Costs for Public Records. Those seeking public records will be charged
only the actual cost of making copies.
      (1)   The charge for paper copies is five cents ($0.05) per page.
      (2)   The charge for downloaded computer files to a compact disc is one
dollar ($1.00) per disc.
      (3)   There is no charge for documents to be e-mailed.
      (4)   Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to them. They will be
charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing supplies.
      (5)   Payment. The cost for public records, if any, shall be paid in
advance.
   (d)   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office. E-mail
is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should
follow the same retention schedules.
      (1)   Records in private e-mail accounts used to conduct public business
are subject to disclosure, and all employees or representatives of this office
are instructed to retain their e-mails that relate to public business, as
defined in division (a) of this section, and to copy them to their business e-
mail accounts and/or to the office's records custodian.
      (2)   The records custodian is to treat the e-mails from private accounts
as records of the public office, filing them in the appropriate way, retaining
them per established schedules and making them available for inspection and
copying in accordance with the Public Records Act.
   (e)   Failure to Respond to a Public Records Request. The Village recognizes
the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to properly respond to a public
records request. In addition to the distrust in government that failure to
comply may cause, the public office's failure to comply with a request may
result in a court ordering the public office to comply with the law and to pay
the requester attorney's fees and damages.
   (f)   Village Records Manager. The Village Fiscal Officer is hereby
designated Records Manager. The Records Manager shall supervise all records
custodians in the Village.
      (1)   The Records Manager shall also distribute the Public Records Policy
to the Village office designated as the record custodian or which otherwise has
custody of the records of that office.
      (2)   The Records Manager shall assure that a poster that describes the
Village Public Records Policy shall be posted in a conspicuous place in the
public office and all locations where the Village has branch records offices.
   (g)   Branch Offices and Branch Records Custodians. Each department head
shall be designated as a Village records custodian of the records maintained by
their department. The office of each department head shall be designated a
branch office of the Village records office. The Records Custodian shall serve
under the management and supervision of the Records Manager.
      (1)   The records custodian shall acknowledge receipt of the copy of the
Village Public Records Policy provided pursuant to Ohio R.C. 149.43(E)(2).
      (2)   The branch records custodian shall assure that a poster that
describes the Village Public Records Policy shall be posted in a conspicuous
place in the custodian's branch records office.
   (h)   Training. To the extent required by Ohio R.C. 149.43(E)(1), all
elected officials or their appropriate designees shall attend training approved
by the Attorney General.
   (i)   Amendments. This policy may be amended at any time by a majority vote
of Village Council and approved by the Mayor. This policy shall at no lime
conflict with the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code.

while committing the violation and that the distracting activity was a
contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the offender may enter
a written plea of guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total
amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the

citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty

safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully

the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within 90 days of the
underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under division (b) of this section.
      (3)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation,
or summons for a violation of any of the sections of the Revised Code listed in
division (b)(2) of this section that indicates that the offender was distracted

contributing factor to the commission of the violation, the officer shall do
both of the following:
         A.   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the

of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Traffic Code that is substantially similar
to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or required to
suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit for a
violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other penalties
authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for the period of time the
court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed for the
violation of the provision of this Traffic Code shall not exceed the period of
suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the violation of the
provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this Traffic Code is
substantially similar.

414.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section. Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic- control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in R.C. § 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular

the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified

thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

414.05 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don’t walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

against that offender’s driver’s license if the offender submits the written
evidence to the court within 90 days of the violation of division (a) of this
section. However, successful completion of the course does not result in a

be assessed for a violation of division (a) of this section in accordance with
R.C. § 4510.036.
      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and R.C. § 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense as a
strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of R.C. § 4511.204 based on
the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under R.C. § 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall

the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in R.C. §
2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period
of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under R.C. § 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a
blood or urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a
physician, a registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an
emergency medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine
specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse
to withdraw blood under this division, if in that person's opinion, the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed
in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical
technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician- paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions. As used in this section:
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device” means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.” Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral
fluid, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine if arrested
for a violation of division (a), (b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A)
or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other
municipal O.V.I. ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section. The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person's whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine for the purpose of
determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine. A law enforcement officer who
makes a request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical
test or tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required
to give the person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but
the officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the
person refuses to take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever
reasonable means are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical
test of the person's whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall
also advise the person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an
independent chemical test taken at the person's own expense. Divisions (g)(3)
and (g)(4) of this section apply to the administration of a chemical test or
tests pursuant to this division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, the arresting
officer shall read the following form to the person:
         “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
State law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
         If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.
or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under state or
municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest for state
O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face increased
penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test
taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the Ohio
or out-of-state driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of the person
and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is to
appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person’s license or permit or it is not in the person’s vehicle, the officer

controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this

tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person’s initial appearance on the charge, which

suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person

enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer’s
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)

that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.

equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid,
or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer. 
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.

serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person’s being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance.  If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of
a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person’s initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons’ arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous

         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio

distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court's indigent drivers' alcohol
treatment fund.

to liability set forth in division (c)(4) of this section applies, the owner or
responsible party for the motor vehicle is subject to a civil penalty if the
motor vehicle is recorded by an automated speed enforcement system while being
operated in violation of this section.

before a hearing officer may do so in the manner indicated on the notice of
liability; and
         F.   A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this
section is not a moving violation for the purpose of assessing points under
Ohio R.C. 4507.021 for minor misdemeanor moving traffic offenses and may not be
recorded on the driving record of the owner or operator of the motor vehicle
and shall not be reported to Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
   (f)   Collection of Civil Penalty. If the civil penalty is not paid, the
civil penalty imposed under the provisions of this section shall be

authorized by law including but not limited to civil suit, in addition to any
other fees or charges authorized by this section in relation to the commission
of a violation of this section, a person liable for the penalties established

      (1)   A vehicle owner or responsible party who receives a notice of

         A.   Pay the civil penalty, in accordance with the instructions on the
notice of liability; or
         B.   Within 30 calendar days of the date of issuance of the notice of
liability, submit to the Village Police Department or its designee one of the
affidavits described in division (c)(2) of this section. Upon receipt of such
an affidavit timely submitted, the Village shall suspend further action against
the owner of the vehicle and instead direct notices and collection efforts to
the person identified in the affidavit submitted by the owner of the motor
vehicle. If the person named in the affidavit, when notified, denies being the
driver or denies liability, then the Village shall resume the notice and
collection process against the vehicle owner, the same as if no affidavit had
been submitted, and if the violation is found to have been committed by a
preponderance of evidence, the vehicle owner shall be liable for any penalties
imposed for the violation; and
         C.   Contest the notice of liability by filing a written request for a
hearing to review of the notice of liability with the Village Police Department
or its designee. A written notice of request for review must be received by the
Village Police Department, or its designee, within 30 calendar days after the
date of issuance of the notice of liability. The failure to give notice of
request for review within this time period shall constitute a waiver of the
right to contest the notice of liability. A hearing officer shall hear reviews.
Hearings shall be held within 45 business days of the date received by the
Village, or its designee, of the request for review; this time may be extended
upon a written reasonable request for additional time or upon reasonable
notification of the hearing officer or local authority with prior notice to all
parties. If the owner or responsible party requests a review of the notice of
liability and a hearing, a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) fee per notice of
liability for such review and hearing shall be assessed to the applicant. The
Hearing Officer may waive this administrative hearing fee only if the owner or
responsible person pleads liable and pays the full amount of the civil penalty
prior to commencement of the hearing. The hearing shall be open to the public,
and a docket shall be posted in a conspicuous place near the entrance to the
hearing room that shall identify, by alleged violator, the hearings scheduled
for that day and the time of each hearing. More than one hearing may be
scheduled for the same time to allow for such things as non-appearances or
admissions of liability.
            1.   The Hearing Officer shall determine whether a preponderance of
evidence establishes that a violation of this section occurred and the person
requesting the review is the party operating the vehicle at the time of the
violation. The hearing officer shall advise the person or entity on the day of
the hearing of the Hearing Officer's decision. A certified copy of the notice
of liability alleging the violation of this section occurred, sworn to or
affirmed by a duly authorized official or agent of the Village of Greenwich, or
its designee, with the recorded images or data produced by an automated speed
enforcement system shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein
and shall be admissible in a proceeding alleging a violation under this
section. Adjudication of liability shall be based on a preponderance of the
evidence.
            2.   If the hearing officer finds sufficient evidence of a
violation, but the vehicle owner or responsible party is not liable, the
hearing officer shall, in writing, issue a decision finding the vehicle owner
and/or responsible party not liable and submit it to the Village of Greenwich,
or its designee.
      (2)   If the owner or responsible party chooses to contest the notice of
liability, the hearing officer may consider any of the following as an
affirmative defense to a violation upon the defense being established by a
preponderance of the evidence by the vehicle owner or responsible party:
         A.   That the motor vehicle or license plates of the motor vehicle
were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under control or
possession of the owner at the time of the violation. In order to demonstrate
that the motor vehicle or license plates were stolen before the violation
occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time
of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a police report about the
stolen motor vehicle or license plates was filed prior to the violation or
within 48 hours after the violation occurred.
         B.   That the motor vehicle was under the custody and/or control of
another person at the time of the violation. In order to establish this, the
owner or responsible person must provide the name and address of the person who
had custody and/or control of the motor vehicle at the time of the violation.
         C.   That this section is unenforceable because the recorded image is
not legible enough to determine the information needed.
         D.   Evidence, other than that adduced pursuant to division (g)(2)A.
of this section, that the vehicle owner or person named in the notice of
liability was not operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation. To
satisfy the evidentiary burden under this subsection, the owner or person named
in the notice of liability shall provide to the hearing officer evidence
showing the identity of the person who was operating the motor vehicle at the
time of the violation, including, but not limited to, the operator's name and
current address, and any other evidence the hearing officer deems pertinent.
         E.   That the motor vehicle operator was yielding the right-of-way to
an emergency vehicle in accordance with Ohio law, or to a funeral procession.
         F.   That under consideration of the totality of the circumstances the
person or entity named in the notice of liability is not liable.
      (3)   If the Hearing Officer finds that the person or entity named in the
notice of liability was not operating the motor vehicle at the time of the
violation or receives evidence under division (g)(2)D. of this section
identifying the person driving the motor vehicle at the time of the violation,
the hearing officer shall provide it to the Village of Greenwich or its
designee within five calendar days, a copy of any evidence substantiating who
was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation.
         A.   Upon receipt of evidence of the responsible party pursuant to
this section or pursuant to division (c)(2) of this section the Village of
Greenwich or its designee may issue a notice of liability, with the name and
address of the responsible party and the information required by division (d)
of this section, to the person that the evidence indicates was operating the
motor vehicle at the time of the violation.
         B.   A notice of liability issued under this division (g)(3) of this
section, shall be sent by the Village of Greenwich or its designee by ordinary
mail no later than 21 business days after the receipt of the evidence from the
hearing officer. The content of a notice of liability issued under this
subsection shall be the same as set forth in division (d)(1) of this section.
   (h)   No fine shall be authorized unless a minimum 30 day grace or public
awareness period is observed prior to issuing any notice of liability.
   (i)   The Village Department of Public Works shall erect signs on every
highway, which is not a freeway, that is part of the State highway system and
that enters into the Village and at each fixed automated speed enforcement
system location. The signs shall inform inbound traffic that the local
authority utilizes traffic law photo-monitoring devices to enforce traffic
laws, signs shall be erected within the first 300 feet of the boundary of the
Village and a fixed automated speed enforcement system location or, if the
signs cannot be located within the first 300 feet of the boundary of the
Village or a fixed traffic law photo-monitoring device, as close to that
distance as possible, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.094(B).
   (j)   The Village shall not issue a violation as described in this section
using an automated speed enforcement system located in a school zone, as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.21, or in a residential area, or within 900 feet of
the boundaries of a State or local park or recreation area or facility, unless
the vehicle involved in the violation is traveling at least six miles per hour
over the posted speed limit.
   (k)   The Village shall not issue a violation as described in this section
using an automated speed enforcement system that is not located in a school
zone, as described in Ohio R.C. 4511.21, or in a residential area, or within
900 feet of the boundaries of a State or local park or recreation area or
facility, unless the vehicle involved in the violation is traveling at least
ten miles per hour over the posted speed limit.
   (l)   The manufacturer or operator of the automated speed enforcement system
used by the Village, or an independent calibration laboratory, shall calibrate
said device before it is used by the Village. The manufacturer or operator of
the automated speed enforcement system shall certify to the accuracy of each
traffic law photo-monitoring device in accordance with applicable Federal law,
if any. For each traffic law photo-monitoring device that is considered mobile
or portable, meaning it is attached to a trailer, vehicle, or other apparatus
that is easily transported to different automated speed enforcement system
locations, the Village shall perform or cause to be performed a system self-
test and calibration verification of said traffic law photo monitoring device
in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications prior to its use at each
automated speed enforcement system location. For each device that is considered
mobile or portable, meaning it is attached to a trailer, vehicle or other
apparatus that is easily transported to
different system locations, the Village Police Department or its designee shall
clearly and conspicuously mark on the outside of the trailer, vehicle, or
apparatus that contains the traffic law photo-monitoring device that the device
is the property or under the control of the Village.

   (b)   Without limiting or precluding the consideration of any other evidence
in determining whether a violation of division (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4)
or (a)(5) of this section has occurred, it shall be prima facie evidence that
the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender's control is in a
category described in division (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this
section if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Regarding an operator allegedly in the category described in

4503.233.
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one violation of this section, R.C. § 4511.203, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order, for 60 days, the
immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of
that vehicle’s license plates. If issued, the order shall be issued and
enforced under R.C. § 4503.233.
         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of this section, R.C. § 4511.203, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal
forfeiture to the state of the vehicle involved in the offense. If issued, the

division shall be distributed in accordance with R.C. § 4503.234(C)(2).
   (d)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under division
(c)(3)A. or (c)(3)B. of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle
from the immobilization before the termination of the period of immobilization
ordered unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under division
(c)(3)C. of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court, neither the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept any
application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,
the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person to
register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the
registration of the vehicle.
   (f)   This section does not apply to motor vehicle rental dealers or motor
vehicle leasing dealers, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4549.65.

is the subject of the conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from
the wrongful entrustment of a motor vehicle.
   (h)   For purposes of this section, a vehicle is owned by a person if, at
the time of a violation of this section, the vehicle is registered in the

license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver's
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

698.02, §
698.03 or R.C. §§ 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community

500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section,
R.C. § 4507.35, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

436.07 DRIVING UNDER SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OR WITHOUT PROOF OF FINANCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY OR IN VIOLATION OF LICENSE RESTRICTIONS. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 436.07 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and
revision of these Codified Ordinances because substantially identical State law
(Ohio R.C. 4507.02(B) - (H)) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly. See
Sections
436.071 through
436.075 for current provisions.)

limited driving privileges.
      (2)   No person shall operate any motor vehicle upon a highway or any
public or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section
may offer evidence to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (4)   A.   Whoever violates division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree. The court may impose upon the
offender a class seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range specified in R.C. §
4510.02(A)(7).
         B.   1.   Except as provided in division (a)(4)B.2. or (a)(4)B.3. of
this section, the court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on
the offender and if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111
or 4510.16, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court, in

for 30 days and the impoundment of that vehicle’s license plates for 30 days in
accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.
            2.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to two violations of this section, or any combination of
two violations of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or of a
substantially similar municipal ordinance, the court, in addition to any other
sentence that it imposes on the offender, may order the immobilization of the
vehicle involved in the offense for 60 days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for 60 days in accordance with R.C. § 4503.233.
            3.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of this section, or any
combination of three or more violations of this section or R.C. § 4510.11,

state.
      (5)   Any order for immobilization and impoundment under this section
shall be issued and enforced under R.C. §§ 4503.233 and 4507.02, as applicable.
The court shall not release a vehicle from immobilization ordered under this
section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under R.C. § 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order from
the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to §
698.02(f) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic
loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate

      (2)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the

violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of
driving under suspension and shall be punished as provided in division (b)(3)A.
or division (b)(3)B. of this section.

to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to

imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, then in addition to any other penalties
provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to R.C. § 2929.28 in
an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any economic loss
arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate result

minimum term of three days in jail. No court shall suspend the first three days
of jail time imposed pursuant to this division.
(R.C. § 4510.037(J))
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to any prosecution brought under this
section that the alleged offender drove under suspension, without a valid
permit or driver’s or commercial driver’s license, or in violation of a
restriction because of a substantial emergency, and because no other person was
reasonably available to drive in response to the emergency.
(R.C. § 4510.04)

vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver's
or commercial driver's license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

to §
698.02(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within two years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of this section
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor
of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under division (b)(2) of this section, if
within three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or
pleaded guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12, this section, or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender’s license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender’s
driver license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range
specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02 (A)(7).

nonresident operating privilege has been suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.19,

monitoring imposed under this division shall not exceed six months. If the
court imposes a mandatory three-day jail term under this division, the court
may impose a jail term in addition to that term, provided that in no case shall

on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or
summons for a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law

elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined

vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   A.   Notwithstanding R.C. §§ 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
permit issued by the Director of Transportation under R.C. § 4513.34 may move
the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway
that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is partly within
and partly without the corporate limits of the municipality. No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state highway
system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the municipality.
         B.   Except as provided in R.C. § 4513.34(B)(3), permits may be issued
for any period of time not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its
discretion determines advisable or for the duration of any public construction
project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the Municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

   (b)   Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.

   (c)   Local Streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified in Section 440.02 or exceeding a gross weight of five tons, upon any
street in the Municipality other than State routes and County roads, except
those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as such by
appropriate traffic signs, and except when such operation is necessary to load
or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of such vehicle
or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage through
the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a State route
or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine such
deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the departure.
   (d)   Modification by Council. When Council decides that it is necessary,
for the preservation of the surfaces of the streets and ways of the Village,
other than State routes, to establish other load limits for the operation of
vehicles upon such streets and ways, it shall establish such load limits, enter
the same upon its minutes and cause the same to be conspicuously posted.

preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief
may require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for
any damage to a roadway or road structure.

sign.
      (6)   Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the
permit granted by the Police Chief shall be cause for immediate revocation or

violation shall also subject the violator to the penalties prescribed by
Sections 408.01 and 408.02.

facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner
retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage
facility fails to provide the notice required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if
applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

      (3)   If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle reclaims it after a
search of the applicable records has been conducted and after notice has been
sent to the owner and any lienholder as described in this section, and the
search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice was sent to the
motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or lienholder shall pay
to the place of storage a processing fee of $25, in addition to any expenses or
charges incurred in the removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of sending the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Police Chief, without charge
to any party, shall file with the clerk of courts of the county in which the
place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with the
requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the clerk,
without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances, to the Police Chief. If the vehicle is to be

of Motor Vehicles, describing the motor vehicle and the manner in which it was
disposed of, and that all requirements of this section have been complied with.
The Police Chief shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Police
Chief's records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage
dealer or other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the
motor vehicle salvage dealer, the clerk of courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
clerk of courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.

of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not

      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally

under R.C. § 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. § 4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor
vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the

606.02 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.

this Municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.
Where the boundary between this Municipality and another jurisdiction is

   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an

committing a violation of either of those sections if the conspiracy, attempt,
or complicity was committed prior to April 4, 2023, and prosecution for that
conspiracy, attempt, or complicity was not barred under this section as it

606.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Culpability." Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   "Intoxication." Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   "Involuntary acts." Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   "Possession." A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.09 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such

purpose of providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed
by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer's regular duties, and giving an outline of

materials included under this section. The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the

attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance if the accused or the accused's attorney demands the testimony of the
person signing the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney,

analyst appointed by the court. Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused's analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances. The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused's
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial. If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused's analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused's attorney. In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused's privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to

court, present at a measurement or weighing of the substance that is the basis
of the alleged violation. Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

violation of this section and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of R.C. § 2903.13, or any substantially similar municipal ordinance,
based on the same conduct involving the same victim that was the basis of the

create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a
duty of care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care,

not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of

prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.

materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered

wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.

agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of

value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.

free from unclean and unsanitary conditions, as defined in this section, and
unless this section is complied with.
   (b)   Conditions Deemed Unsanitary.
      (1)   Any structure or building, or any portion therof, used for human
habitation, shall be deemed to be in an unclean and unsanitary condition by
reason of any portion of such building being infected with a communicable
disease, or by reason of the absence therein of toilet facilities as required
by law or ordinance by reason of the known presence of sewer gas therein or
thereon.
      (2)   Any structure or building, or any portion thereof, used for human
habitation, shall be deemed to be in an unclean and unsanitary condition when
such structure is unfit for human habitation or in a condition dangerous or
harmful to the lives or health of the occupants by reason of the inhabited
portion of such structure being damp or wet, or by reason of such lack of
repair, such accumulation of dirt, filth, litter, refuse or other offensive or
dangerous substances or liquids, such defects in, lack of repair of or improper
use of the drainage, plumbing or ventilation, or the existence on the premises
of such a nuisance or other condition, as is likely to cause sickness among the
occupants. Any structure or building or any portion thereof, used for human
habitation, which is in such an unclean or unsanitary condition is hereby
declared to constitute a public nuisance and is prohibited.
   (c)   Orders to Abate or Vacate Premises. Whenever the County Board of
Health ascertains from examinations or by reports of its inspectors or sanitary
officers, or otherwise, that a public nuisance exists, as defined in division
(b) hereof, in or upon any structure or building, or portion thereof, and is of
the opinion that such nuisance is capable of being abated without immediate
vacation of the premises, or such portion thereof, and serves notice upon the
owner of such house or his or her lessee or agent, or the person in possession,
charge or control thereof, directing him or her to abate such nuisance and
remove the unclean or unsanitary conditions within such reasonable time as may
be fixed by such Board and specified in such notice, it shall be the duty of
such owner, agent or person to abate such nuisance within such time. Whenever
such abatement does not take place within such time or whenever, in the opinion
of such Board, such abatement is impossible or impractical without an immediate
vacation of the house, or portion thereof, and such Board serves notice upon
the owner, lessee, agent or person in possession, charge or control thereof to
vacate or cause the vacation of such house, or portion thereof, designated in
the notice, then it shall be the duty of such owner, lessee, agent or person to
vacate or cause the vacation of such house, or portion thereof, within twenty
days from the date of the service of such notice or within a shorter time (not
less than twenty-four hours in any case) as may be specified in such notice.
Whenever, either in addition to or without the service of such notice on such
owner, lessee, agent or person in possession, charge or control, such Board is
of the opinion that such nuisance can be abated by a tenant or other occupant
of such house or portion thereof, and such notice, either for abatement of the
nuisance or for vacation of the premises, is served upon such tenant or other
occupant, then it shall be the duty of such tenant or other occupant to comply
with the terms of such notice and to abate the nuisance or vacate the premises
accordingly. After any such notice or order of vacation, no person shall occupy
or permit the occupancy of such premises, or portion thereof, until such
nuisance is completely abated and such building or portion thereof is rendered
clean and sanitary in accordance with the terms of such notice of the Board.
When there is no owner, agent, lessee or person in charge, possession or
control, who is a resident of or can be served in the Village, then personal
service outside of the Village on any such owner, agent, lessee or person in
charge, possession or control by anyone delegated by such Board to make such
service, or service by registered letter, or, if the address of the owner,
lessee, agent or person in possession, charge or control is unknown or service
is not secured by registered letter after an effort to do so, then notice by
publication once a week for two consecutive weeks in any newspaper of general
circulation in the Village or by posting or attaching to or on the outside of
such structure or building a copy of the notice or order consecutively for two
weeks, shall have the same effect as service within the Village.
   (d)   Hearings. When a notice or order of vacation follows a notice or order
of abatement, as provided in division (c) hereof, such notice or order of
vacation shall not be enforced as provided in this section unless such notice
or order of abatement specifies a time when the person so notified or ordered
may appear before the County Board of Health or the officer issuing the same to
show cause why such order or notice of vacation should not be issued and unless
such Board (or a majority thereof) or officer is present at its or his or her
office at the time so specified, such time to be not less than twenty-four
hours after the service of the notice or order. When the notice or order of
vacation is issued as provided in division (c) hereof, without a previous
notice or order of abatement, such notice or order of vacation shall not be
enforced as provided in this section unless it specifies a time, not less than
five days after the service thereof, when the person so notified or ordered may
appear before the Board issuing the same to show cause why such notice or order
should not be enforced and unless such Board of a majority thereof is present
at its office at the time so specified, provided that when, in the opinion of
at least four-fifths of the members of such Board, an emergency exists which
requires, for the protection of the health of occupants, the vacation of the
building, or portion thereof, without a delay of five days, then no such fixing
of a time for hearing is required.
   (e)   Posting Notice of Vacation. Whenever such procedure, in the opinion of
the County Board of Health, is desirable or necessary, such Board may affix
conspicuously on the building, or part thereof, the notice or order of
vacation.
   (f)   Enforcement of Vacation Order by Police Chief. When the notice or
order of vacation has not been complied with and the County Board of Health
certifies such fact to the Police Chief of the Village, together with a copy of
the order of notice, it shall be the duty of the Chief to enforce such notice
or order of vacation and to cause such premises to be vacated in accordance
with the terms of such notice or order.
   (g)   Enforcement Through Court Proceedings. Whenever the County Board of
Health certifies to the Solicitor any failure to comply with any such order or
notice of vacation, with the request that civil proceedings for the enforcement
thereof be instituted, the Solicitor shall institute any and all proceedings,
either legal or equitable, that may be appropriate or necessary for the
enforcement of such order or notice and the abatement of the nuisance against
which such order or notice was directed, such suits or proceedings to be
brought in the name of the Village. Proceedings under this section shall not
relieve any party defendant from criminal prosecution or punishment under these
Codified Ordinances or under any other criminal law or ordinance in force
within the Village.
   (h)   Cleanliness of Hotels, Lodging Houses, etc. Every owner of, and every
agent in charge of, a tenement house, lodging house, tourist home, tourist
cabin or hotel, or part thereof, shall cause to be kept thoroughly clean all
parts of the premises not within the occupied apartments. No person shall place
filth, urine or fecal matter in any place other than that which is provided for
the same or keep filth, urine or fecal matter in his or her apartment or upon
his or her premises for such length of time as to create a nuisance, and every
tenant shall keep his or her apartment in a clean and sanitary condition. The
walls of courts and shafts, unless built in a light color brick or stone, shall
be thoroughly whitewashed or painted a light color and shall be so maintained.
Such whitewash or paint shall be renewed as required by the County Board of
Health.
660.14 UNCLEAN PREMISES.

recommendations to Council on or before June 1. A copy of such report shall
also be sent to the State Department of Health.
   (c)   Individual Orders for Abatement. If, upon inspection, it is found that
the published order has not been complied with, as to any lot or parcel of
ground, Council shall, by resolution, direct the owner, occupant or person in
charge of such land to abate such nuisance within ten days setting forth the
nature of the violation and the acts required to be done. Such resolution shall
provide that upon failure or refusal to comply with such order, the work
required will be done by the Village, with the amount expended therefor to be a
valid claim against such owner or occupant, to be charged as a lien upon such
land and recovered by the Village by suit in a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (d)   Service or Publication of Resolution. A copy of the resolution adopted
under division (c) hereof may be served personally, at the usual place of
residence of such owner, occupant or person in charge of such land, or by
registered mail. In lieu of such service, the resolution may be published for
two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village.
   (e)   Drainage of Lots. No owner, occupant or person in charge of any lot or
parcel of ground shall cause or permit water to accumulate thereon and become
stagnant, permit culverts, drains or natural watercourses thereon to become
obstructed or cause or permit any putrid or unsanitary substance to accumulate
thereon.
   (f)   Periodic Inspections. Independent of the annual clean-up and
inspection provided in divisions (a) and (b) hereof, the County Health Officer
or the Chief of Police shall make periodic inspection of properties within the
Village and shall report all violations of division (e) hereof to Council.
Council shall thereupon, by resolution, proceed to order such nuisance abated
as provided in divisions (c) and (d) hereof.
   (g)   Noncompliance; Remedy of Village. In case of failure or refusal to
comply with any such resolution of Council, the work required thereby may be
done at the expense of the Village and the amount of money expended therefor
shall be a valid claim against such owner, occupant or person in charge and a
lien upon such land which may be enforced by a suit in any court of competent
jurisdiction. Proceedings under this section shall not relieve any party
defendant from criminal prosecution or punishment for a violation of any of the
provisions of these Codified Ordinances or any other criminal law or ordinance
in force within the Village.
660.15 RODENT INFESTATION.
   (a)   As used in this section, "rodent" means any mouse or rat and "person"
means any owner, tenant, lessee, occupant or any other individual, firm or
corporation in control of any premises.

structure which is infested or populated with rodents, to such an extent that
human habitation of such place is or would be dangerous or detrimental to
health.
   (c)   The County health authorities shall cause an inspection to be made of
any premises when there is reasonable cause to believe that the premises are

the rooms in any health care facility in which persons are confined as a matter
of health care may be designated as smoking areas in their entirety. The

   (i)   “Obscene.” When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to
ordinary adults or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest.

698.02 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
666.99 or
698.03 of this code or R.C. § 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.  307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(5)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(5)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(5)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (6)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (7)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
         (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)C. of this section, if an
offender violates any condition of a community control sanction, the sentencing
court may impose upon the violator one or more of the following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a related provision under
R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14, or R.C. § 2925.141, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the conditions of a
community control sanction based on a minor drug possession offense, as defined
in R.C. § 2925.11, or violated R.C. § 2925.12, R.C. § 2925.14(C)(1), or R.C. §
2925.141, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the sentencing
court shall not impose any of the penalties described in division (c)(4)B. of
this section based on the violation.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.

intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender' occupation or care
for the offender' family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,

applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a

division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.

vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to

modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to

   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f) and, if the offender
is being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in R.C. § 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this division (f) and
R.C. § 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this
division (f), imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this division (f) include, but are not limited
to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim's economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            2.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid
by the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the
victim’s estate against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an
award of restitution under this division (f) in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than 5% of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity
responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney
for the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify
the payment terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount
of restitution ordered, except as provided in R.C. § 2929.281(A).
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:

thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021 and the
costs of global positioning system device monitoring;

residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under
this section, the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall, except as provided in divisions (f)(4)B.
and (f)(4)C. of this section, be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be
credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
         B.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may retain up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to cover administrative costs.
         C.   A court that imposes a fine under division (f)(4)A. of this
section may assign up to 25% of amounts collected in satisfaction of the fine
to reimburse the prosecuting attorney for costs associated with prosecution of
the offense.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered, at no charge, a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same
manner and form as a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just. If the court is a
county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the Clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
      (9)   If the court imposes restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration
costs on a business or corporation, it is the duty of the person authorized to
make disbursements from assets of the business or corporation to pay the
restitution, fines, fees, or incarceration costs from those assets.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
698.03 IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, if the
offender enters an Alford plea, the sentencing court shall not consider whether
the offender showed genuine remorse for the offense.
      (3)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under §
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under § 698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of
the offense or upon offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for
prior offenses demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is
necessary to deter the offender from committing a future criminal offense.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral and written
statement made by the victim, the victim’s representative, the victim’s
attorney, if applicable, the defendant, the defense attorney, and the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by R.C.
Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04 ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05 MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another state, or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21 or 4511.19, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a prison term
that is imposed for a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.06, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or
a felony violation of R.C. § 2903.04 involving the operation of a vehicle by
the offender and that is served in a state correctional institution when the
trial court specifies that it is to be served consecutively. When consecutive
jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or
more misdemeanors and one or more felonies under this division, the term to be
served is the aggregate of the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender
shall serve all terms imposed for a felony before serving any term imposed for
a misdemeanor.
(ORC 2929.41)
698.06 MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: Section 698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and
revision of these Codified Ordinances because substantially identical State law
(Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07 SUSPENSION OF DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
similar to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially similar.

804.08 REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LICENSES.
   A license may be revoked by the Mayor or by the Administrator at any time
for conditions or considerations which, had they existed at the time of
issuance, would have been valid grounds for its denial; for any
misrepresentation of a material fact in the application discovered after
issuance of the license; for violation of any provision of this chapter or
other law or ordinance relating to the operation of the business or enterprise
for which the license has been issued; or upon conviction of a licensee for a
violation of any Federal, State or Municipal law or ordinance involving moral
turpitude. Such revocation shall become effective upon notice served upon such
licensee or posted upon the premises affected.
   As a preliminary to revocation, the Mayor or the Administrator may issue an
order suspending such license, which shall become effective immediately upon

reason for suspension and may provide conditions under which reinstatement of
the license may be obtained. Upon compliance with such conditions within the

January 1, 1979, of all resident unincorporated businesses, professions and
other activities, derived from work done or services rendered or performed and
business or other activities conducted in the Village;
      (3)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned
on and after January 1, 1979, of a resident individual, partner or owner of a
resident unincorporated business entity attributable to the Village and not
levied against such unincorporated business entity;
      (4)   On the net profits attributable to the Village earned on and after
January 1, 1979, of all nonresident unincorporated businesses, professions or
other activities, derived from work done or services rendered or performed and
business or other activities conducted in the Village;
      (5)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned
on and after January 1, 1979, of a resident individual, partner or owner of a
nonresident unincorporated business entity not attributable to the Village and
not levied against such unincorporated business entity; and
      (6)   On the net profits earned on and after January 1, 1979, of all
corporations, derived from work done or services rendered or performed and
business or other activities conducted in the Village.
   (b)   The portion of the net profits attributable to the Village of a
taxpayer conducting a business, profession or other activity, both within and
without the boundaries of the Village, shall be determined as provided in
Section 880.03 and in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by
Council pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 654. Passed 12-5-78.)
880.03 DETERMINATION OF INCOME SUBJECT TO TAX.
   (a)   In the taxation of income which is subject to taxation under this
chapter, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or
profession both within and without the boundaries of the Village disclose with
reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to that part
of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the Village,
then only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of income taxation. In the absence of such records, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
Village for purposes of income taxation in the same proportion as the average
ratio of:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village during the taxable period, to the average net book value of all of the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used in
this paragraph, "real property" includes property rented or leased by the
taxpayer. The value for such property shall be determined by multiplying the
annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village, to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed; and
      (3)   The gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made
and services performed during the taxable period in the Village, to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
services, wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
   (b)   As used in this section, "sales made in the Village" means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Village;
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village, regardless of where title passes, even though transported from a
point outside the Village, if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion; and
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village to purchasers outside the Village, regardless of where
title passes, if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
(Ord. 654. Passed 12-5-78.)
880.04 EFFECTIVE DATE.
   The tax imposed under this chapter shall be levied, collected and paid with
respect to salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned on and
after January 1, 1979, and with respect to the net profit of businesses,
professions and other activities earned on and after January 1, 1979, provided,
however, that where the fiscal year of the business, profession or other
activity differs from the calendar year, the tax shall be applied to that part
of the net profit for the fiscal year as is earned on and after January 1,
1979, to the close of the taxpayer's fiscal year. Thereafter, the taxpayer
shall report on its fiscal year basis.
(Ord. 654. Passed 12-5-78.)
880.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   On or before April 15 of the year following the effective date of this
section, and on or before April 15 of each year thereafter, every taxpayer
engaged in any business within the Village, the net profits of which are
subject in whole or in part to the tax imposed by this chapter, shall, whether
or not a tax be due thereon, make and file with the Tax Administrator a final
return on a form furnished by or obtainable from said Tax Administrator.
   On or before April 15 of the year following the effective date of this
section, and on or before April 15 of each year thereafter, each taxpayer,
except as otherwise provided herein, shall, whether or not a tax be due
thereon, make and file with the Tax Administrator a final return on a form
furnished by or obtainable from said Tax Administrator. Like returns shall be
filed at the same time and in the same manner by all persons whose wages,
salaries, bonuses, incentive payments, commissions, fees and other compensation
received during the preceding taxable year are subject to the tax imposed by
this chapter. However, where an employee's entire earnings for the year are
paid by an employer and the Village tax thereon has, in each instance, been
withheld and deducted by the employer from the gross amount of the entire
earnings of such employee-taxpayer, and where the employer of such employee has
filed a report or return in which such employee's entire and only earnings are
reported to the Tax Administrator, and where such employee has no taxable
income other than such earnings, it shall not be necessary for such employee to
file a return for any taxable year in which such conditions have prevailed.
   Any person who receives compensation for services performed for an employer,
in any form, and, in addition, income from any business activity or occupation
not subject to withholding under this chapter, must file a declaration and a
final return.
(Ord. 888. Passed 9-16-97.)
   (b)   In all returns filed hereunder there shall be set forth the aggregate
amount of salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive payments, commissions, fees and
other compensation received, and/or net profits earned, by and during the
preceding year and subject to such tax, together with such pertinent
information as the Clerk-Treasurer may require.
   (c)   The return shall also show the amount of the tax imposed by this
chapter on such earnings, or net profits, or both.
   (d)   The taxpayer making the return shall, at the time of filing thereof,
pay the Clerk-Treasurer the amount of tax shown to be due and unpaid by the
return. If the taxpayer has, at the time of making such final return, overpaid
his or her tax, such taxpayer shall show the amount of overpayment and may, in
such return, request a refund therefor or request that the amount thereof be
credited against the amount which will be required to be paid by the taxpayer
on the next succeeding installment of tax which may become due.
   (e)   Where any portion of the tax otherwise due has been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Regulation IV-A of Resolution 10-78,
passed December 5, 1978, or where an income tax has been paid to another
municipality, pursuant to Section 880.13, credit for the amount so paid shall
be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the balance, if any, shall
be due and payable at the time of filing such final return.
   (f)   Upon written request of the taxpayer, the Clerk-Treasurer may extend
the time for filing the annual return for a period of not more than six months
or not more than thirty days beyond any extension requested of and granted by
the Federal Internal Revenue Department for the filing of the Federal Income
Tax Return.
(Ord. 654. Passed 12-5-78.)
880.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   It is the duty of each employer who employs one or more persons on a
salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis, to deduct from
compensation paid to any employee subject to this chapter, the tax of one
percent of such salary, wage, bonus, incentive payment, commission or other
compensation due by such employer to such employee. The tax shall be deducted
by the employer from:
      (1)   All compensation paid to employees who are nonresidents of the
Village for services rendered, work performed or other activities engaged in to
earn such compensation, within the Village; and
      (2)   The gross amount of all salaries, wages, bonuses, incentive
payments, commissions or other form of compensation paid to employees who are
residents of the Village, regardless of the place where the services are
rendered.
   (b)   All employers who or which maintain an office or other place of
business in the Village are required to make the collections and deductions
specified in this section, regardless of the fact that the services on account
of which any particular deduction is required, as to residents of the Village
were performed at a place of business of any such employer situated outside the
Village.
   (c)   The mere fact that the tax is not withheld will not relieve the
employee of the responsibility of filing a return and paying the tax on the
compensation received.
   (d)   Commissions, which are fees paid to professional men and women,
brokers and others who are independent contractors and not employees of the
payor, are not subject to withholding or collection of the tax at the source.
Such taxpayers must in all instances file returns and pay the tax pursuant to
the provisions of Section
880.05.
   (e)   In the case of employees who are nonresidents of the Village, the
amount to be deducted is one percent of the compensation paid with respect to
personal services rendered in the Village.
   Where a nonresident receives compensation for personal services rendered or
performed partly within and partly outside the Village, the withholding
employer shall deduct, withhold and remit that portion of the compensation
which is earned within the Village in accordance with the following rules of
apportionment.
      (1)   If the nonresident is a salesperson, agent or other employee whose
compensation on the basis of commissions depends directly on the volume of
business transacted by him or her, the deducting and withholding shall attach
to the portion of the entire compensation which the volume of business
transacted by the employee within the Village bears to the volume of business
transacted by him or her within and outside the Village.
      (2)   The deducting and withholding of personal service compensation of
all other employees (including officers of a corporation) shall attach to the
portion of the personal service compensation of such employee which the total
number of working days employed within the Village bears to the total number of
working days employed within and outside of the Village.
      (3)   If it is impossible to apportion the earnings as provided above,
because of the peculiar nature of the service of the employee or the unusual
basis of compensation, apportionment shall be made in accordance with the facts
and the tax deducted and withheld accordingly.
      (4)   The occasional entry into the Village of a nonresident employee who
performs the duties for which he or she is employed entirely outside the
Village, but enters the Village for the purpose of reporting, receiving
instructions, accounting, etc., incidental to his or her duties outside the
Village, shall not be deemed to take such employee out of the class of those
rendering their services entirely outside the Village.
   (f)   Subject to subsection (g) hereof, an employer shall withhold the tax
on the full amount of any advances made to an employee on account of
commissions, whether by way of a drawing account or otherwise, where such
advances are in excess of commissions earned.
   (g)   An employer required to withhold the tax on compensation paid to an
employee shall, in determining the amount on which the tax is to be withheld,
ignore any amount allowed and paid by the employer to the employee for expense
necessarily and actually incurred by the employee in the actual performance of
his or her services, provided, however, that such expense must be of the kind
and in the amount recognized and allowed as a deductible expenses for Federal
Income Tax purposes.
(Ord. 654. Passed 12-5-78.)
   (h)   Every owner of one or more rental units within the Village is hereby
directed to furnish to the Income Tax Administrator a semi-annual roster, on a
form provided by or obtainable from said Tax Administrator, containing the
names of all adult persons residing in each such rental unit and shall also
file a statement of any changes in the roster at the end of each month. The
semi-annual statement provided for herein shall be filed with the Tax
Administrator on or before January 31 and July 31 of each year, unless an
extension of time is granted by the Tax Administrator. The first such roster
will be due to be filed on the first filing date (January or July) after the
effective date of this section (Ordinance 888, passed September 16, 1997).
(Ord. 888. Passed 9-16-97.)
880.07 RETURNS OF TAX WITHHELD AND PAYMENT.
   (a)   Deductions from salaries, wages and other compensation required to be
made by employers are to begin with compensation earned on and after January 1,
1979. The first return and payment required to be made on account of such
deductions shall be made, filed and paid to the Clerk-Treasurer between April
1, 1979, and April 30, 1979.
   (b)   Each employer within the Village who employs one or more persons on a
salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis shall deduct monthly, or
more often than monthly, and at the time of the payment of such salary, wage,
commission or other compensation, the tax of one percent of salaries, wages,
commissions or other compensation due by the employer to the employee and shall
make a return and pay to the Clerk-Treasurer the amount of taxes so deducted as
follows:
      (1)   For the three months ending March 31, on or before April 30;
      (2)   For the three months ending June 30, on or before July 31;
      (3)   For the three months ending September 30, on or before October 31;
and
      (4)   For the three months ending December 31, on or before the following
January 31.
   (c)   The reporting periods referred to in the preceding subsection are
elastic to this extent: The employer will use the same quarterly accounting
period for reporting taxes withheld under this chapter as he or she uses in
reporting quarterly taxes withheld to the Federal government.
   (d)   Such return shall be on a form prescribed by and obtainable from the
Clerk-Treasurer and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
therefor by the Clerk-Treasurer.
   (e)   For adjustment of errors in returns of tax withheld by employees, see
Section
880.12.
(Ord. 654. Passed 12-5-78.)
880.08 LIMITATION ON CREDIT FOR TAX PAID AT SOURCE.
   The failure of any employer, residing either within or outside the Village,
to collect the tax and to make any return prescribed in this chapter, shall not
relieve the employee from the payment of such tax in compliance with this
chapter respecting the making of returns and the payment of taxes.
(Ord. 654. Passed 12-5-78.)
880.09 STATUS AND LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS.
   Every employer is deemed to be a trustee of the Village in collecting and
holding the tax required under this chapter to be withheld, and the funds so
collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds until the same are
paid to the Village.
   Every such employer required to deduct and withhold the tax at the source is
liable directly to the Village for the payment of such tax, whether actually
collected by such employer or not.
(Ord. 654. Passed 12-5-78.)
880.10 DECLARATIONS.
   (a)   An employee whose entire wage, salary or other compensation for any
taxable year will be subjected to the withholding provisions under Section
880.06, whose tax will accordingly be withheld as to his or her entire earnings
for such year by his or her employer, and who, during such taxable year,
expects to derive no other compensation or other income which is subject to tax
under this chapter, need not file a declaration as provided in this section.
   (b)   All other taxpayers subject to the taxes imposed in Section
880.02, and every taxpayer who anticipates any income or net profits not
subject to total withholding as provided in subsection (a) hereof, shall file
with the Clerk-Treasurer a declaration of his or her estimated tax as follows:
      (1)   On or before April 15, 1980, every such calendar year taxpayer
shall file a declaration of his or her estimated tax for the taxable period
beginning January 1, 1980, and ending December 31, 1980.
      (2)   A similar declaration shall be filed by each such calendar year
taxpayer on or before April 15 of each subsequent year during the effective
period of this chapter, and each such declaration shall contain a statement of
the taxpayer's estimated tax for the full taxable year in which such
declaration is filed.
   (c)   Taxpayers who or which are permitted, pursuant to Section
880.04, to return and pay their tax upon a fiscal year basis, shall file their
first declaration within three and one-half months after the beginning of the
first fiscal year beginning on and after January 1, 1979, and the subsequent
declaration for each year thereafter on or before the fifteenth day of the
fourth month following the beginning of each such fiscal year. Those taxpayers
on a fiscal year basis shall make quarterly payments on or before the fifteenth
day of the fourth month and on or before the last day of the sixth, ninth and
twelfth months following the beginning of such fiscal year. The first
installment, equal to at least one-fourth of the estimated tax, must accompany
the declaration.
   (d)   The estimated tax for a calendar year taxpayer may be paid in full
with the filing of the declaration or in equal installments on or before April
15, June 30, September 30 and December 31.
   (e)   The declarations so required shall be filed upon a form furnished by
or obtainable from the Clerk-Treasurer. Any taxpayer who has filed an estimate
for Federal Income Tax purposes may, in making the declaration required
hereunder, simply state therein that the figures therein contained are the same
figures used by the taxpayer in making the declaration of his or her estimate
for the Federal Income Tax. However, in addition to such statement, any such
taxpayer may, in such declaration, modify and adjust such declared income so as
to exclude therefrom income which is not subject to tax under this chapter.
   (f)   Any estimate filed hereunder may be amended by the filing of an
amended estimate at the time prescribed for the payment of any installment of
tax paid in accordance with this section.
(Ord. 654. Passed 12-5-78.)
880.11 RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY EMPLOYERS AND TAXPAYERS.
   Employers and others subject to the tax under this chapter are required to
keep such records as will enable the filing of true and accurate returns,
whether of taxes withheld at the source or of taxes payable upon earnings or
net profits, or both, and such records are to be preserved to enable the Clerk-
Treasurer, or any agent or employee of the Clerk-Treasurer, to verify the
correctness of returns filed.
(Ord. 654. Passed 12-5-78.)
880.12 COLLECTION OF DEFICIENCIES; ALLOWANCE OF CREDIT FOR OVERPAYMENT.
   (a)   If, as a result of investigation conducted by the Clerk-Treasurer, a
return is found to be incorrect, the Clerk-Treasurer is authorized to assess
and collect any underpayment of tax withheld at the source or any underpayment
of tax owing by any taxpayer with respect to earnings or net profits or both.
If no return has been filed and a tax is found to be owing, the tax actually
owing may be assessed and collected with or without the formality of obtaining
a delinquent return from the employer or taxpayer.
   (b)   Should it be disclosed, either as a result of an investigation by the
Clerk-Treasurer or through the medium of the filing of a claim or petition for
a refund or credit, that an overpayment has been made, the Clerk- Treasurer
will refund such overpayment.
   (c)   The employer will in every instance be required to pay the full tax
which should have been withheld, even though he or she may fail to withhold
from the employee. If too much has been withheld, the excess shall be refunded
by the employer to the employee. While the withholding agent (i.e. the
employer) will be expected to maintain complete records of such adjustments
with the employees, any such adjustment made during any month will not need to
be reflected in the withholding return or disclosed by schedules or statements
thereto attached.
   (d)   In those cases in which too much has been withheld by an employer from
an employee and remitted to the Clerk-Treasurer and there has been a
termination of the employee-employer relationship, the taxpayer (i.e. the
employee) may obtain an adjustment by application to the Clerk-Treasurer.
(Ord. 654. Passed 12-5-78.)
880.13 RECIPROCITY.
   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Village but who receives net
profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other personal service compensation
for work done or services performed or rendered outside of the Village, if it
is made to appear that he or she has paid a municipal income tax on such net
profits, salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation to another
municipality, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter
of the amount so paid by him or her or in his or her behalf to such other
municipality. The credit shall not exceed 100 percent of the tax assessed by
this chapter on such net profits, salaries, wages, commissions or compensation
earned in such other municipality where such tax is paid.
(Ord. 654. Passed 12-5-78.)
880.14 ADMINISTRATION; DUTIES OF CLERK-TREASURER.

the taxpayer and shall send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the
amount of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if
any.

880.16 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   All taxes imposed by this chapter, including both individual taxes and taxes
withheld or required to be withheld from wages by an employer and remaining
unpaid after they have become due, shall bear interest on the amount of the
unpaid tax at the rate of eighteen percent (one and one-half percent per month
or portion thereof).
   The individual taxpayer upon whom such taxes are imposed, as well as any
employer required by this chapter to deduct, withhold and pay any taxes imposed

percent if the tax due is paid within thirty days of the due date; fifteen
percent if the tax due is paid within sixty days of the due date; twenty
percent if the tax due is paid within ninety days of the due date, and a

the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (a)(1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
   (b)   For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled in

   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
881.091 of this chapter,
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding

qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the

   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting

employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's

or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(b)(2) of this section, except that “location” shall be substituted for
“municipal corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that
division.
   (b)   (1)   Subject to divisions (c), (e), (f) and (g) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal service in a municipal
corporation that imposes such a tax if the employee performed such service in

services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services at the
location for more than twenty days.
         C.   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in section 881.051 of this chapter.
         D.   The employee is a professional athlete, professional entertainer,
or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the performance of
services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick
up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that has
been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished, processed,
remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         D.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (b)
(2)C. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (d)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (b)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
881.03 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
881.051 of this chapter.
   (g)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those service on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this State that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining.
   Notwithstanding division (d) of this section, if, during a calendar year,
the number of days an individual performs personal service at a petroleum
refinery exceeds twelve, the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal
corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on
which the individual performed services at the refinery.

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:

deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no

      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (d)   If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by Section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall

lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (e) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Ohio R.C. 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding

person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period that information shall be
indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (f)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent

following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;

are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (g)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (h)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late, fails
to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit
amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:

profit” of the taxpayer.
         A.   “Net profit” for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section

            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid

      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an

881.19(a) of this chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer

the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the

real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in

resides. A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (f)   (1)   Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,

income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
881.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4. of this chapter, by a municipal corporation to
which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer
shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit
that was apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer
be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.

      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
881.03(c)(1) of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return

purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.062 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit

the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
881.062 of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass- through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of

make the computations required under Section
881.062 of this chapter by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in

“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
   (g)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is

or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.
   (h)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

prescribed for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.

wages, commissions or compensation earned in such other municipality where such
tax is paid.

881.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation plan
described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
“qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the “qualifying tax rate”
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 2015-08. Passed 12-1-15.)
881.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
881.081 of this chapter.
(Ord. 2015-08. Passed 12-1-15.)
881.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
881.096 of this chapter.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
881.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carry-forward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
881.096 of this chapter.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
881.081 of this chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 2015-08. Passed 12-1-15.)
881.09 ANNUAL RETURN
881.091 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal Taxable Income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section

person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized

   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (e)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual may be required, only at the Tax

      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date

         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
881.092 of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
881.092 of this chapter, the provision in Section
881.092 of this chapter prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall

section, unless the provisions of division (h)(3) apply.
      (3)   A.   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does
not expect to be a taxpayer subject to municipal income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
Municipality for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in Section
881.03(c)(1)) within the Village).
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the Municipality and
does not expect to be subject to municipal income tax for the taxable year.
         B.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the Municipality. The affidavit shall also
include the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within [Municipality/City/Village], make any sales in [Municipality/
City/Village], or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by [Municipality/
City/Village] during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to
the tax levied by [Municipality/City/Village] for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with
[Municipality/City/Village] income tax ordinance and rules and regulations.”
The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (h)(3)B.
of this section the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change.
         D.   Nothing in division (h)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (i)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
Section
881.051(b)(1)B. of this chapter.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
“The date of postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the Postal Service.
      (2)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
881.051 of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

meaning as in Section
881.052 of this chapter.

expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
               The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of

connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

881.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (a)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to the

   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its municipal income tax.

period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal

for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax

consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under

that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by Section

beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars
($10.00) or less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer.
Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, a request filed under
this division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to
only those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the
taxpayer's annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by
the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless it
is also filed within the time prescribed in Section
881.096 of this chapter. Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund

withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten

   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
881.18 of this chapter.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been

Postal Service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the Postal Service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
881.10(a)(4) of this chapter.

entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,

claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation

through the duration of any compromise or payment-over- time agreement.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment- over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 2015-08. Passed 12-1-15.)
881.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the

   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice

necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.

records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.

prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
881.10 of this chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
881.99 of this chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide

within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
881.10 of this chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
881.99 of this chapter for a violation of Section
881.15 of this chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax

subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator

of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.

with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who

Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty

Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent (20%), as determined by
voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 2015-08. Passed 12-1-15.)
881.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
            The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled
in the Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
            Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The Board member appointed by
         the top administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the
discretion of the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the Board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-08. Passed 12-1-15.)
881.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time as the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
881.18 of this chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
881.096 of this chapter.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
881.18 of this chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
881.096 of this chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(d) of this section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
       (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 2015-08. Passed 12-1-15.)

before January 31 of each year, unless an extension of time is granted by the
Tax Administrator. The first such roster will be due to be filed on the filing
date after the effective date of the section.

881.97 COLLECTION AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   This chapter shall continue in full force and effect insofar as the
levy of taxes is concerned until repealed, and insofar as the collection of
taxes levied hereunder and actions and preceding for collecting any tax so

collection of taxes or for the punishment of violations of this chapter have
been fully terminated, subject to the limitations contained in Section
881.19.
   (b)   Annual returns due for all or any part of the last effective year of
this chapter shall be due on the date provided in Section
881.091 as though the same were continuing.
(Ord. 2015-08. Passed 12-1-15.)
881.98 SAVINGS CLAUSE.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this chapter, or any tax imposed
against, or exemption from tax granted to, any taxpayer or forms of income
specified herein is found to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, such
unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other
parts of this chapter. It is hereby declared to be the intention of the
legislative authority of the Municipality that this chapter would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid sentence, clause, section
or part thereof not been included in this chapter.

1022.01 DETERMINATION OF NEED FOR CONSTRUCTION.
   All new housing units shall have sidewalks installed within one year of
residency.
(Ord. 921. Passed 3-21-00.)
1022.02 SIDEWALK COMMISSION.
   There shall be created a Sidewalk Commission in the Village, consisting of
six individuals. Four shall be residents of the Village, one Councilperson, and
Zoning Inspector. One member shall be from each quadrant of the Village.
   (a)   The Sidewalk Commissioners shall be appointed by the Mayor with the
consent of Council and shall serve four years without compensation. The first
appointments shall be for one to four years with a new member being appointed
yearly thereafter.
   (b)   The Sidewalk Commission shall meet quarterly and keep accurate records
of their meetings as provided by law, forwarding minutes of each meeting to
Council within fifteen days after each meeting.
   (c)   Whenever it is reasonably necessary to protect and preserve the health
and safety of the residents of the Village, as well as the public at large, the
Council, upon the recommendation of the Sidewalk Commission, shall require the
new construction of sidewalks or the repair of existing sidewalks by a majority
vote thereof. When the Council orders the installation of new sidewalks or the
repair of existing sidewalks without the recommendation of the Sidewalk
Commission, said order shall be by ordinance, approved by at least five
members.
      (1)   The block in which such lot or land is located contains sidewalks
fronting on fifty percent or more of the real estate on one or both sides of
the street;
      (2)   The block in which the lot or land is located is situated in such a
manner that new sidewalks are necessary in order to complete the pattern of
sidewalks created by adjacent or nearby blocks having sidewalks; or to complete
the pattern of sidewalks necessary to join existing sidewalk patterns with
local pedestrian generating facilities; or
      (3)   It is deemed necessary and advisable to provide a sidewalk pattern
between corner intersections having existing sidewalks.
   (d)   All initial complaints and/or sidewalk requests should be directed to
the Zoning Inspector.
   (e)   Property owners may submit applications for variances to the Sidewalk
Commission. These requests must be submitted within fifteen days after receipt
of the notice to either repair or construct sidewalks. The Sidewalk Commission
shall forward all variance requests to the Zoning Board along with
recommendations for consideration where:
      (1)   The character of the neighborhood is such that the installation of
sidewalks would not serve any public purpose; or
      (2)   Where unique physical conditions make the installation of sidewalks
an undue hardship, and the absence of this installation would not materially
affect the public safety and convenience, including the requirement that a bond
be posted where appropriate.
(Ord. 921. Passed 3-21-00.)
1022.03 NOTICE TO ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNER TO CONSTRUCT OR REPAIR.
   When Council or the Sidewalk Commission determines that there is a need for
construction or repair of a sidewalk, as set forth in Sections
1022.01 and
1022.02, the Village Administrator or Zoning Inspector shall serve a notice in
writing, personally or by certified mail, upon the owner of the subject
adjacent property directing such owner to construct or repair such sidewalk. No
such owner shall fail to comply with such notice within thirty days from the
date of service of such notice.
(Ord. 921. Passed 3-21-00.)
1022.04 NONCOMPLIANCE; REMEDY OF VILLAGE.
   If, after the expiration of sixty days from the date of service of the
notice, the sidewalk has not been constructed or repaired, the Village
Administrator shall cause such construction or repair to be done, and the cost,
including engineering, inspection and other incidental expenses, shall be
certified to the Clerk-Treasurer for collection, either in cash or by placing
the same upon the tax duplicate, according to law. Such remedy shall be in
addition to the penalty provided in Section
1022.99.
   (a)   If the cost to repair or construct said sidewalk is between one dollar
($1.00) and two hundred dollars ($200.00), the assessment will be assessed over
a two year period;
   (b)   If the cost to repair or construct said sidewalk is between two
hundred one dollars ($201.00) and four hundred dollars ($400.00), the
assessment will be over a four year period;
   (c)   If the cost to repair or construct said sidewalk is between four
hundred one dollars ($401.00) and six hundred dollars ($600.00), the assessment

either directly or indirectly into the Village’s sanitary sewerage system, the
charge or rental shall be based upon the quantity of water used as measured by
the Village water meter therein in use, and the quantity of water used and
waste discharged as determined by the Village’s sewer rate ordinance and the
whole reduced by any deductions as determined by the Village’s sewer rate
ordinance.
      (2)   On premises using water, either all or in part, from sources other
than the waterworks system of the Village and not measured by the Village water
meter or other meter acceptable to the Village Administrator, the quantity of
water consumed shall be measured by a meter installed and maintained for such
purpose at the expense of the owner or other interested party and acceptable to
the Village Administrator; or the owner or other interested party may, at his
or her option, request the Village Administrator to determine the amount of
water consumed on the premises in accordance with accepted engineering
practices, and the quantity of water consumed on the premises shall be the
amount so measured by such meter or so determined by the Village Administrator.
      (3)   In the event the Village Administrator is satisfied that a portion
of the water from any source consumed upon any premises does not and cannot
enter the system, then in such case the owner or other interested party may, at
his or her expense, install and maintain such separate metering devices, or
provide such data in conformity with accepted engineering practices, as shall
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Village Administrator, that portion of
the water so consumed which is discharged into the system, and such portion
shall be the basis for measuring the sewer charge under the Village’s sewer
rate ordinance, if applicable.

      (2)   All industrial waste discharges to the public sewers by major
contributing industries shall as a minimum meet the national pretreatment
standards or best practical control technology currently available for
incompatible pollutants as published in the latest Federal Regulations, unless
the Village is committed, in its NPDES permits to remove a specific percentage
of the incompatible pollutant. In those instances the applicable pretreatment
standards may be correspondingly reduced to levels determined by the engineer,
Administrator, or his duly authorized representative or state regulatory
agencies.
      (3)   Special conditions. No statement contained in this section shall be
construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the
Village and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual

they are not normally discharged. In addition to discharge reports, the
Administrator may require information in the form of self monitoring reports.
   (b)   Records and monitoring.
      (1)   All industrial users who discharge or propose to discharge
wastewater to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of
production and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts or
concentrations as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the requirements
of this chapter and any applicable state or federal pretreatment standards or
requirements.
      (2)   Such records shall be made available upon request by the
Administrator. All such records relating to compliance with pretreatment
standards shall be made available to officials of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency upon demand. A summary of such data indicating the industrial

to the Administrator.
      (3)   The owner or operator of any premises or facility discharging
industrial wastes into the system shall install at his own cost and expense
suitable control manholes or access points, and monitoring equipment to
facilitate the accurate observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes. Such
equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times. Sampling methods, location, duration, and frequencies
are to be determined on an individual basis subject to approval of the
Administrator.
      (4)   Wastewater volume determined. The volume of flow used for computing
industrial waste surcharge shall be the metered water consumption of the person
except as herein provided in this division.
         A.   If the person discharging industrial wastes into the public
sewers procures any part, or all, of this water from sources other than a
metered public water system, all or part of which is discharged into the public
water system, all or part which is discharged into the public sewer, the person
shall install and maintain at his expense water meters of a type approved by
the engineer or Administrator for purpose of determining the volume of water
obtained from these sources. Access to these meters shall be made available to
representatives of the Village at any reasonable time. The accuracy of said
meters shall be verified at the discharger's expense on a once per year basis
at a minimum or at the request of the Administrator, by an independent testing
company.
         B.   The person discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers
may install and maintain at his expense metering devices for determining the
volume of waste being discharged to the public sewer, from which the industrial
waste surcharge would be computed. The measuring devices shall be of a type
acceptable to the engineer or Administrator.
         C.   The engineer or Administrator may require the installation of
devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged if these volumes cannot
otherwise be determined from the metered waste consumption records. Any
metering devices for discharged to the public sewer, from which the industrial
waste surcharge would be computed. The measuring devices shall be of a type
acceptable to the engineer or Administrator.
      (5)   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Administrator may allow
such facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, with the
approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over such street or sidewalk,
and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping
or parked vehicles.
      (6)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Administrator's
requirement and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (c)   Inspection, sampling and analysis.

1044.10 Prohibitions and Limitation may be made on the basis of either
instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater. Composite
samples may be taken over a twenty-four-hour period, or over a longer or
shorter time span, as determined necessary by the Administrator to meet the
needs of specific circumstances.
         A.   Sampling and monitoring. Industrial wastes discharged into the
public sewers shall be subject to periodic inspection with a determination of
character and concentration of said wastes. The determination shall be made as
often as may be deemed necessary by the engineer or Administrator but in no
case less than two twenty-four-hour composite samples per month. The owner
shall be responsible for the collection and testing of the aforementioned
samples.
            1.   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be
representative of the composition of the wastes. The sampling shall be
accomplished by use of automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting
composite samples.
            2.   Access to sampling locations shall be granted to the engineer
or his authorized representative at all times. Every care shall be exercised in
the collection of samples to insure their preservation in a state comparable to
that at the time same was taken.
      (2)   Analysis of industrial wastewater.
         A.   Laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be
performed in accordance with the current edition of "Standards Methods" or the
"Method for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste" published by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. Analysis of those pollutants not covered by

SECTION 100 INTRODUCTION
Village of Greenwich was originally zoned in 1960 for the protection of the
health, safety, and welfare of its constituents. As time has moved on it has
been necessary to amend some of the original zoning, and the future will no
doubt necessitate future changes to keep our growing community developing in an
orderly, well planned manner. A Place You Will Be Proud To Live In!
Any changes to the zoning Ordinance or map made after the printing date may be
incorporated in this book. Copies of any changes may be obtained on request
from the Zoning Inspector during his office hours. We encourage you to keep
your book up to date by procuring such data.

1464.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village of
Greenwich, Council of Greenwich State of Ohio, does ordain these Flood Damage
Reduction regulations as follows in this chapter.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order lo minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood-prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.05 LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village of Greenwich as identified in Section
1464.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.06 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Huron County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Huron County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective January 19, 2011.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village as required by Section
1464.27 Subdivisions and Large Developments.
   (b)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Village Administrator’s office 18 New Street,
Greenwich, Ohio 44837.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.07 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance (resolution), the
more restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any
deed, restriction, covenant or easement, but the land subject to such interests
shall also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.08 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.10 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be
protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the
100-year flood with average depths of less than one foot or with contributing
drainage area less than one square mile; and areas protected by levees from the
base flood.
   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the 500-year
floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS).” The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood protection elevation (FPE).” The base flood elevation. In areas
where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the “flood
protection elevation” can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard.” A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.” An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC).” An official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to man-made changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home.” A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a “manufactured home” includes manufactured
homes and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.” As specified in O.A.C. 3701-27-01, any tract
of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation, are
parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any
roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as
part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the
individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a
“manufactured home park”, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).” A Federal program enabling
property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection
against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide an
insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction.” Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village Flood Insurance
Rate Map, September 30, 1988, and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (aa)   “Person.” Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including State and
local governments and agencies. An “agency” is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, State college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or State community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle.” A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis; (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection; (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered professional architect.” A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered professional engineer.” A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor.” A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special flood hazard area.” Also known as “areas of special flood
hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood-prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data, including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood-prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction.” The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual “start of construction” means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure.” A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial damage.” Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement.” Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (kk)   “Variance.” A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation.” The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

1464.21 MAP MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.
   To meet National Flood Insurance Program minimum requirements to have flood
data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to ensure that Village of Greenwich
flood maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1464.06 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
   (a)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
      (1)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
         A.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
         B.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
         C.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
         D.   Subdivision or large development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section

as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate
supporting documentation made in writing by the Village Administrator, and may
be submitted at any time.
   (c)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the Village have been
modified by annexation or the community has assumed authority over an area, or
no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
for a particular area. In order that the Village Flood Insurance Rate Map
accurately represent the Village boundaries, include within such notification a
copy of a map of the Village suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the Village has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.22 DATA USE AND FLOOD MAP INTERPRETATION.
   The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps
and other data showing areas of special flood hazard:
   (a)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas, or
in FEMA- identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
Federal, State, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections 1464.34 through 1464.39.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.23 SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes, including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.33 ASSURANCE OF FLOOD-CARRYING CAPACITY.
   Pursuant to the purpose and methods of reducing flood damage slated in these
regulations, the following additional standards are adopted to assure that the
reduction of the flood-carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
   (a)   Development in Floodways.
      (1)   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
      (2)   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted, provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
         A.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1464.21(a);
         B.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
         C.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that would
be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
         D.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
         E.   Concurrence of the Village Administrator of the Village of
Greenwich and the Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by
the proposed actions.
   (b)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
      (1)   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1464.33(a)(2)A. and C. through E,
   (c)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a
watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of bankfull stage shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood- carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1464.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.34   APPEALS BOARD ESTABLISHED.
   (a)   The Village Council shall appoint an Appeals Board consisting of Risk
Management Committee and three members appointed by the Zoning Board. The
members shall serve three-year terms, after which time they shall be
reappointed or replaced by the Village Council. Each member shall serve until
his or her successor is appointed.
   (b)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his or her absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public, except that the
Board may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings
in accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
office of the Village Clerk.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.35 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE APPEALS BOARD.

1464.37 of these regulations.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.36 APPEALS.
   (a)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official action
of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board, provided that such person shall file,
within ten days of the date of such notice and order, or other official action,
a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation of any
item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision. Such
appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.37 VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within 30 days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing.
      (1)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1464.37(c)(1)A. through K. have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond one- half acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk, resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
(Ord. 2011-01. Passed 1-18-11.)
1464.38 PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
   (b)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
   (c)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.
   (d)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition to
the appeal or variance.
   (e)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
   (f)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become part
of the record for appeal.

   (a)   Title. This chapter shall be known as the Exterior Property
Maintenance Code of the Village.
   (b)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health,
safety, morals, welfare, and sanitation by establishing minimum standards
governing the maintenance and condition of residential and nonresidential
properties within the Village and to fix certain responsibilities and duties
upon owners and operators and to fix penalties for the violations of any
provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 980. Passed 1-3-06.)
1488.02 APPLICABILITY.
   Every residential and non-residential structure and the premises on which it
is situated in the Village, shall be required to comply with the provisions of
this chapter, whether or not such structure or use shall have been constructed,
altered or repaired before or after the enactment of this chapter, and without
regard to any permits or licenses which shall have been issued for the use or
occupancy of the structure, for the construction or repair of the structure or
use or for the installation or repair of equipment or facilities prior to the
effective date of this chapter. This chapter establishes minimum standards for
the initial and continued occupancy and use of all such structures and does not
replace or modify standards otherwise established for the construction, repair,
alteration or use of the structure.
(Ord. 980. Passed 1-3-06.)
1488.03 CONFLICT OF LAWS.
   In any case where a provision of this chapter imposes a higher standard than
that set forth in any other ordinance by the Village or law of the State, then
the standard set forth herein shall prevail, but if a provision of this chapter
imposes a lower standard than that imposed by any other ordinance of the
Village or law of the State, then the higher standard contained in any such
other ordinance or law shall prevail.
(Ord. 980. Passed 1-3-06.)
1488.04 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Notification.
      (1)   All structures, premises, and uses within the Village are subject
to exterior inspections from time to time by the Police Chief, Zoning Inspector
or Village Administrator.
      Where a violation of any provision of this chapter other than a violation
of Section
1488.10(a) and (b) is found to exist, the Police Chief, Zoning Inspector or
Village Administrator, shall cause a written notice of such violation to be
served upon the person responsible for the correction thereof. The notice shall
specify the violation committed. Within 14 days of the date of service of
notice, a reasonable period of time to correct or abate the violation shall be
established. Such reasonable period of time for the correction and abatement of
the violations shall be pursuant to a repair schedule submitted in writing by
the violator and approved by the Police Chief, Zoning Inspector or Village
Administrator. In the event that weather is a major consideration in correcting
or abating the violation, the Police Chief, Zoning Inspector or Village
Administrator may extend the time set out herein to not more than 60 days
immediately following the occurrence of appropriate weather conditions.
      (2)   Notice shall be served by certified mail to the owner of the
property appearing on the current record of the County Auditor. If the last
known address of the property owner cannot be ascertained, the notice shall be
posted on the outside front entrance of the structure in alleged violation.
      (3)   In the absence of an appeal, as provided below, the completion of
notice, and failure to comply, shall constitute a final order as to
administrative proceedings.
   (b)   Appeal.
      (1)   Within 14 days of the date of service of notice, the property owner
affected by the notice may request a hearing thereof before the Board of Zoning
Appeals (Zoning Commission) by filing a written request with the Police Chief,
Zoning Inspector or Village Administrator. The Police Chief, Zoning Inspector
or Village Administrator shall forward such request to the Board within five
days of receipt. The Chairperson of the Board, upon receipt of the request,
shall set the matter down for hearing within 30 days, allowing at least five
days’ notice to the party and the Police Chief, Zoning Inspector or Village
Administrator. The Board of Zoning Appeals may sustain, modify or dismiss, in
whole, or in part, any action required to correct or abate the violation set
forth in the notice and shall issue an order incorporating its determinations,
and such order shall be a final order as to these administrative proceedings.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall consider only the following in
determining appropriate action to be taken, to wit:
         A.   That any modification of the original order of the Police Chief,
Zoning Inspector or Village Administrator shall not, in any material way, alter
the standards of this chapter and shall not affect detrimentally the health or
safety of occupants, or the health, safety or welfare of the occupants or
owners of adjacent premises or of the immediate neighborhood; and
         B.   That strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on the property owner, by reason of compelling expenditure for repair
of the premises which would be substantially disproportionate to any benefit to
the health, safety or welfare of the community that might be derived therefrom.
      (3)   No license, permit, or other certification of compliance with this
chapter shall constitute a defense against any violation of any other local
ordinance applicable to any structure or premises, nor shall any provision
herein relieve any property owner from complying with any such other provision,
nor any official of the Village from enforcing any such other provision.
