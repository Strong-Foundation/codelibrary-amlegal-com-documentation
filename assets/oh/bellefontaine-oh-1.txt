EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
 
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
 
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
 
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
 
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
 
101.05 CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
 
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
 
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
 
101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
 
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
 
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
 
101.07 DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
 
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
 
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
 
101.08 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
 
101.99 GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

(Ord. 03-82. Passed 12-9-03.)
191.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Mandatory Filing. On or before April 15th of each year, every resident
shall, except hereinafter provided, make and file with the Tax Commissioner a
Municipal tax return on a form prescribed by and acceptable to the Tax
Commissioner, whether or not a tax is due. When the return is made for a fiscal
year or other period different from the calendar year, the return shall be
filed on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th) month following
the end of such fiscal year or period. The Tax Commissioner is hereby
authorized to provide by regulation that the return of an employer or
employers, showing the amount of Municipal tax deducted by said employer or
employers from the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other
taxable income of a nonresident employee, and paid by him or them to the Tax
Commissioner may be accepted as the return required of a nonresident employee
whose sole income, subject to tax under this Tax Code, is such qualifying
wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income.
   (b)   A husband and wife may file either separate returns or a joint return
for municipal purposes, even though one of the spouses has neither taxable
income nor deductions included on the Municipal return regardless of whether
their federal and state returns were filed separately or jointly. If a joint
City return is made, the tax shall be computed on the aggregate taxable income
and the liability with respect to the tax shall be joint and several.
   (c)   The return shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Commissioner; or on a
generic form, if the generic form, when completed and filed, contains all of
the information required to be submitted with the Municipality’s prescribed
return and, if the taxpayer or return preparer filing the generic form
otherwise complies with the Tax Code governing the filing of returns.
   (d)   The return shall set forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of qualifying wages, commissions, other
compensation received, allocated, apportioned or set aside, other income
defined by statute as taxable, and gross income from any business, profession
or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income earned during the preceding year and subject to said tax;
      (2)   The amount of the tax imposed this Tax Code on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, copies of
federal or state tax returns and/or schedules, or other information as the Tax
Commissioner may require, including a statement that the figures used in the
return are the figures used for federal income tax adjusted to set forth only
such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
   (e)   (1)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a
federal income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a
Municipal Income Tax Return by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s federal
extension request with the Municipal Tax Division. Any taxpayer not required to
file a federal income tax return may request an extension for filing a
Municipal Income Tax Return in writing. The request for extension must be filed
on or before the original due date for the annual return, if the request is
granted, the extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
first day of the month following the month to which the due date of the federal
income tax return has been extended.
      (2)   The Tax Commissioner may deny a taxpayer’s request for extension if
the taxpayer:
         A.   Fails to timely file the request; or
         B.   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request, (if
applicable); or
         C.   Owes the Municipality any delinquent income tax, penalty,
interest or other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of income tax; or
         D.   Has failed to file any required income tax return, report, or
other related document for a prior tax period.
      (3)   The granting of an extension for filing a Municipal tax return does
not extend the due date as provided in this section for payment of the tax;
hence, penalty and interest may apply to any unpaid tax during the period of
extension at the rate set out by Section
191.10. No penalty shall be assessed in those cases in which the return is
filed and the final tax paid within the extension period provided all other
filing and payment requirements to the Tax Code have been met. Any extension by
the Tax Commissioner shall be granted upon the condition that declaration
filing and payment requirements have been fulfilled; however, if, upon further
examination it then becomes evident that declaration filing and payment
requirements have not been fulfilled, penalty and interest may be assessed in
full and in the same manner as though no extension had been granted.
   (f)   Payments with Returns. 
      (1)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes shown as due. However,
credit shall be allowed for:
         A.   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
191.06 ; and
         B.   Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
191.07; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section
191.07 for tax paid to another municipality;
         D.   Unless the tax return is signed, dated, accompanied by payment if
tax is due, and all schedules and W-2's are included, the tax return shall not
be deemed to be legal filing and will be returned to the taxpayer;
         E.   Twelve (12) Day Occasional Entry Rule:
            1.   A non-resident individual who works in Bellefontaine twelve
(12) or fewer days per year shall be considered an occasional entrant, and
shall not be subject to Bellefontaine’s municipal income tax for those twelve
(12) days.
            2.   For purposes of the twelve (12) day calculation, any portion
of a day worked in Bellefontaine shall be counted as one day worked in
Bellefontaine, whether it is an hour or eight (8) hours.
            3.   This rule is limited to individuals only. It does not apply to
businesses or corporations.
            4.   Beginning with the thirteenth (13th) day, the employer of said
individual shall begin withholding Bellefontaine income tax from remuneration
paid by the employer to the individual, and shall remit the withheld tax to
Bellefontaine.
            5.   If the individual is self-employed, it shall be the
responsibility of the individual to remit the appropriate income tax to the
City of Bellefontaine.
            6.   The twelve (12) day occasional entry rule does not apply to
entertainers or professional athletes, their employees or individuals who
perform services on their behalf, or to promoters and booking agents of such
entertainment events or sporting events.
               (Ord. 04-82. Passed 12-14-04.)
      (2)   Subject to the limitations contained in Section
191.16  of this Tax Code, any taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to
which the Municipality is entitled under the provisions of this Tax Code may
have such overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at
his election indicated on the return, such overpayment (or part thereof) shall
be refunded, provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than five
dollars ($5.00) shall be collected or refunded.
   (g)   Amended Returns. 
      (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in
Section
191.10 and
191.11. The Tax Commissioner shall provide by regulation the format in which
such amended return shall be filed. A taxpayer may not change the method of
accounting or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the
original return.
      (2)   Within three (3) months from the final determination of any federal
tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s Municipal tax liability, such taxpayer
shall make and file an amended Municipal return showing income subject to the
Municipal tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
   (h)   Information returns, schedules and statements required to support tax
returns which are incomplete without such information shall be filed within the
time limits set forth for the filing of the tax returns and the failure to file
such information returns, schedules and statements shall be a violation of this
Tax Code. Provided, however, that the taxpayer shall have ten (10) days after
notification by the Tax Commissioner, or his authorized representative, to file
the items required by this paragraph.
(Ord. 03-82. Passed 12-9-03.)
191.06 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding by Employer. Each employer within, or doing business
within, the Municipality who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage,
commission or other compensation basis shall deduct, when such salary, wage,
commission or other compensation is paid, allocated, apportioned or set aside,
the tax at the rate provided in Section
191.02  hereof on the qualifying wages due by such employer to each such
employee and shall, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the month
following such withholding, make a return and pay to the Tax Commissioner the
amount of taxes so deducted. The return shall be on a form or forms prescribed
by or acceptable to the Tax Commissioner and shall be subject to the Rules and
Regulations prescribed by the Tax Commissioner. Such employer shall be liable
for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not
such taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual’s disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer’s exemption from the requirements to withhold
the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (d)   So long as the taxes withheld by an employer for the Municipality
during the measurement period are less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per
month, payments may be made quarterly on or before the last day of the month
following the end of each quarter, subject to the approval of the Tax
Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner may revoke the approval of quarterly filing
and payments whenever the Tax Commissioner has reason to believe that the
conditions for granting such authorization have changed, where judged
incorrectly, were not met, or when it is in the best interest of the
Municipality to do so. Notice of withdrawal shall be made in writing and, in
such case, the employer must begin to file in accordance with this section.
   (e)   Employer Considered as Trustee. Each employer in collecting such tax
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
Municipality, as a trustee for the benefit of the Municipality, and any such
tax collected by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is paid
to the Municipality, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer. Each
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (f)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages shall
pay all such tax to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this
section. In the event taxes withheld from the qualifying wages of employees are
not paid to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of this section,
all officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees having control or
supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and
making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for the tax not
returned or paid to the Municipality as well as any related interest and
penalties, and are also liable under the provisions of Section
191.12 hereof. The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer’s,
member’s, manager’s, employee’s, or trustee’s liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (g)   Withholding Return; List of Employees. Each employer shall file a
withholding tax reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid
all employees, the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding
along with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to
withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted. Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the
Municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social
security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year and the amount of Municipal tax withheld. if the total tax
withheld from any employee included tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of
information to the Municipality concerning each employee. The withholding tax
reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28
following the end of such calendar year.
   (h)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the Municipality when the services were performed
in the Municipality. The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall
include the name, address and social security number (or federal identification
number), and the amount of the payments made. Federal form(s) 1099 may be
submitted in lieu of such listing. The information shall be filed annually on
or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (i)   Domestic Servants. No person shall be required to withhold the tax on
the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable income
paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such person’s
residence. However, such domestic servants shall be responsible for filing and
paying their own returns and taxes.
(Ord. 03-82. Passed 12-9-03.)

rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to City of
Bellefontaine each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (d)    "Refundable credit" means the amount of City of Bellefontaine
income tax that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    If, in addition to City of Bellefontaine, a taxpayer has paid tax
to other municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each
municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal
corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to City of
Bellefontaine for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
      (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)    The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had
established the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)    The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

domiciled in City of Bellefontaine for all or part of the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described
in division (E)(1)(a) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in City of
Bellefontaine for all or part of the taxable year.

corporation where the educational institution is located;
         (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with City of
Bellefontaine. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one

of each of two consecutive days in City of Bellefontaine.
      (3)    All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.

   (F)    This division applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the City of Bellefontaine, unless the taxpayer is an individual
who resides in the City of Bellefontaine or the taxpayer is an electric
company, combined company, or telephone company that is subject to and required
to file reports under Chapter 5745 of the ORC.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the City of Bellefontaine shall be considered as
having a taxable situs in the City of Bellefontaine for purposes of municipal
income taxation in the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City of Bellefontaine during the taxable period to the average original
cost of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in the business or profession during the same period, wherever
situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City of Bellefontaine to wages, salaries, and other
compensation paid during the same period to individuals employed in the

Section
192.04 (C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City
of Bellefontaine to total gross receipts of the business or profession during
the same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(l) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City of Bellefontaine, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax

with respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an
alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
192.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
192.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(l)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,
and other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation

vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(l)(c) of this section, and except
as provided in division (G) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows:

sales within the City of Bellefontaine and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
            (iii)    The property is shipped from a place within the City of
Bellefontaine to purchasers outside the City of Bellefontaine, provided that
the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the

         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the City of Bellefontaine to the extent that such services are performed in the
City of Bellefontaine.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the City of Bellefontaine shall be sitused to the
City of Bellefontaine.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City of Bellefontaine shall be
sitused to the City of Bellefontaine.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City of Bellefontaine based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the City of Bellefontaine.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City of Bellefontaine's tax
only if the property generating the net profit is located in the City of
Bellefontaine or if the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a

such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of
calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

by the real estate agent or broker shall be allocated to the City of
Bellefontaine, if applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent
or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in
the City of Bellefontaine to the commissions received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the City of Bellefontaine
shall report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for the City of Bellefontaine. The individual
may claim a credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another
municipal corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the
City of Bellefontaine's income tax ordinance.
      (7)    When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(l) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,

            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section

performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:

owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the Taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
         A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in
writing on or with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely
filed amended net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The
election applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed
and for all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
         The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax
administrator of each municipal corporation with which, after applying the
apportionment provisions authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required
to file a net profit tax return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be
required to notify the tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a
qualifying remote employee's or owner’s qualifying remote work location is
located, unless the taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return
with that municipal corporation due to business operations that are unrelated
to the employee's or owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
         After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to
every municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The
taxpayer shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in such municipal corporation.Nothing in this
division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under this division
after properly revoking a prior election.
      (3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division
(F)(l) of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made
the election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section 192.04 of this Ordinance.

Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in City of Bellefontaine shall withhold an income tax from the
qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in City of
Bellefontaine. Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not
required under Section
192.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
192.01(B)(i) of this chapter, of 1.60%. An employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date
that the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or
constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to
the benefit of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of City of Bellefontaine the greater of the income taxes deducted
and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of City of Bellefontaine in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399,
or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of City of Bellefontaine in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200.

be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of City of Bellefontaine. The payment
of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and City of Bellefontaine as
the return required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to
the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
       (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold City of Bellefontaine income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
          (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by
the failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold
the tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to City of Bellefontaine the tax withheld relieves the employee
from liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to City
of Bellefontaine income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent
the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for City of Bellefontaine until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for City of Bellefontaine during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year,;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting

respect to such employee;
                  (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold City of
Bellefontaine income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's
employees and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the
tips and gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this
division, a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or
gratuity is paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to
the employee, or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit
card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section

subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales

corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of

      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the

documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by City of Bellefontaine to determine and verify the
taxpayer's municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under
division (F) of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on

Bellefontaine's income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an individual
shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of the taxable
year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this
division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City of Bellefontaine’s income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's the City of Bellefontaine income tax return. If the
request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City of
Bellefontaine income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the
taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
City of Bellefontaine's income tax return. The extended due date of the City of
Bellefontaine’s income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of
the state income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City of Bellefontaine, the Tax
Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise
than as provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required
to file annual returns.
      (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first.

municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150.
         Division (G)(5) of this section does not apply to an extension
received under division (G)(2) of this section if the tax administrator has
actual knowledge that the taxpayer failed to file for a federal extension as
required to receive the extension under division (G)(2) of this section or
failed to file for an extension under division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, City of Bellefontaine
shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to City of Bellefontaine
for a taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with
City of Bellefontaine an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this
section, unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to City of Bellefontaine income tax
ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:
                      (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with
City of Bellefontaine for the immediately preceding taxable year because the
person performed services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)
(g)) within City of Bellefontaine.
                      (ii)    The person no longer provides services in City of
Bellefontaine and does not expect to be subject to City of Bellefontaine income
tax for the taxable year.
                 (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed
affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the
location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within City of Bellefontaine. The
affidavit shall also include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans
to perform any services within City of Bellefontaine, make any sales in City of
Bellefontaine, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by City of
Bellefontaine during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to
the tax levied by City of Bellefontaine for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with
city of Bellefontaine income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The
person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
                  (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division
(H)(3)(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file a tax
return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information
that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the
affidavit change.
                 (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits
the Tax Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the City of Bellefontaine by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in Section 192.04 shall be
allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the
taxpayer by City of Bellefontaine, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to City of Bellefontaine and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by City of Bellefontaine to be filed in
accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by City of Bellefontaine,
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by City of Bellefontaine or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the
taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with
the provisions of this chapter and of City of Bellefontaine's ordinance,
resolution, or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,
or documents.

withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of City of
Bellefontaine for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by City of Bellefontaine during
the period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days

eightieth day after the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant
shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to
demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to

otherwise due to the City of Bellefontaine before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of

the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by City of Bellefontaine in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order

   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to City of
Bellefontaine's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a

binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City of Bellefontaine income tax return for that taxable
year if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to City of Bellefontaine. A taxpayer that is required
to file a consolidated City of Bellefontaine income tax return for a taxable
year shall file a consolidated City of Bellefontaine income tax return for all
subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City of Bellefontaine income
tax return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
192.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City of Bellefontaine
income tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-
through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
192.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to City
of Bellefontaine. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity
shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
 192.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to City
of Bellefontaine. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity
shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
192.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to City
of Bellefontaine;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to City of
Bellefontaine income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this
chapter on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated City of Bellefontaine income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
 192.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City of Bellefontaine income
tax return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties,
fines, charges, or other amounts imposed by City of Bellefontaine in accordance
with this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the
corporation is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more
members of such an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with City of Bellefontaine before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with City of Bellefontaine may continue to
file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

required to and does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to
another municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages,
commissions, net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter may
claim a nonrefundable credit upon satisfactory evidence of the tax paid to the

development zone created under Section 715.691 or a joint economic development
district created under Section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the ORC to the same
extent that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who
are employed in another municipal corporation.
   (C)    If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other

qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation" subject to
tax in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by

   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for City of Bellefontaine's income
tax for the current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to City of Bellefontaine
for the taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is
entitled, and after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or
credit from another taxable year.
   (B)   (1)    Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for City of Bellefontaine from qualifying wages
shall be considered as paid to the City of Bellefontaine in equal amounts on
each payment date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid
on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve
months shall make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax
Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under division
(G) of Section
 192.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to City of
Bellefontaine, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five (45) percent of the tax liability
for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half (67.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year. For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)    When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
192.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
 192.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
City of Bellefontaine under Section
 192.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in City of Bellefontaine
but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 15-74. Passed 12-2-15; Ord. 17-80. Passed 12-12-17.)
192.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS. 
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 15-74. Passed 12-2-15.)
192.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
 192.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by City of Bellefontaine:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
192.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
192.18 (A)(4). (Ord. 15-74. Passed 12-2-15.)
192.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with City of Bellefontaine, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by City of
Bellefontaine as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with City of Bellefontaine is subject to recovery by City
of Bellefontaine. If City of Bellefontaine's tax on that income is imposed
after the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to
the other municipality, City of Bellefontaine shall allow a nonrefundable
credit against the tax or withholding City of Bellefontaine claims is due with
respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the
first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If City of Bellefontaine's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using
City of Bellefontaine's tax rate. However, if City of Bellefontaine's tax rate
is greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess
of the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to City of Bellefontaine, along with
any penalty and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.   
(Ord. 15-74. Passed 12-2-15.)
192.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for City of Bellefontaine changes as a result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with City of Bellefontaine. The amended return shall be filed on
a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
192.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by City of Bellefontaine. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
192.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.   
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City of Bellefontaine's tax liability,
that taxpayer shall make and file an amended City of Bellefontaine return
showing income subject to City of Bellefontaine income tax based upon such
final determination of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay
any additional City of Bellefontaine income tax shown due thereon or make a
claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than
ten dollars.
(Ord. 15-74. Passed 12-2-15.)
192.12 LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
                (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was
filed, whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
192.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
192.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by City of Bellefontaine does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
          (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, of the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
192.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
 192.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover City of Bellefontaine income tax or
related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following
time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 15-74. Passed 12-2-15.)
192.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 15-74.
Passed 12-2-15.)
192.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
           (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City of Bellefontaine
official, or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom
the assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence
that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
       (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City of
Bellefontaine official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in
this division prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering
into a compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an
appeal with the local board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 15-74. Passed 12-2-15.)
192.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to City of Bellefontaine that arises pursuant to City of Bellefontaine's income
tax imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of City of
Bellefontaine:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due. (Ord. 15-74. Passed 12-2-15.)
192.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of City of
Bellefontaine as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a
designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue
service, the tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit City of Bellefontaine from publishing
or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with
respect to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-74. Passed 12-2-15.)
192.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by City of Bellefontaine ordinance or
state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud City of Bellefontaine or the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 15-74. Passed 12-2-15.)
192.18 INTEREST AND PENALTIES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Applicable law" means this chapter, the resolutions, ordinances,
codes, directives, instructions, and rules adopted by City of Bellefontaine
provided they impose or directly or indirectly address the levy, payment,

yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining

to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or

this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

Auditor will, within five days notify such party in writing of a hearing date,

City Auditor of its
requirements.

the vendor if, for a period of twelve consecutive months following the date the
bond was filed, the vendor has filed all returns and paid all taxes due within
the time prescribed in this chapter.

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer.
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place.
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code. (ORC 4511.12)
313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:

is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.

has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.

within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign
or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the
absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those

   (d)   Physical Control.
      (1)   As used in this subsection, “physical control” means being in the
driver’s position of the front seat of a vehicle and having possession of the
vehicle’s ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   A.   No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if, at the
time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
            1.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse,

   (e)   Evidence; Tests.  
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood, oral fluid, or
urine withdrawn and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any
other relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of subsection (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the presence and concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, oral fluid, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this division regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect
the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as
described in that section. The court may admit evidence on the presence and
concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood, breath, urine, oral fluid,
or other bodily substance test at the request of a law enforcement officer
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or
a blood or urine sample is
obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered nurse, an
emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-
paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall withdraw a
blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled
substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does not apply to
the taking of breath, oral fluid, or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood under this
division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would
be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance withdrawn under
this subsection (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved
by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by
the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, oral fluid, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.
            (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains. The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug

combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person. The immunity provided in this subsection also extends to
an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section. The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours. If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs. The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years. The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. The
court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock device
relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days. The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory jail term under
this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring. The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term. The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not
exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days. The court
shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection unless,
subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a sentence
under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of house arrest
with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both
electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring. The court may impose a
jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term. The cumulative
jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider. The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted. Upon the request of the court,
the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the court,
including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related to
alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years. The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. (ORC 4511.19)
            5.   In all cases, if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s
name, immobilization of the vehicle involved in the offense for ninety days in
accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233 and impoundment of the license plates of
that vehicle for ninety days. (ORC 4511.193)

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person
has a valid driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 or a
commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division

dollars ($1,000); and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27,
the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
   (e)   If the offender is sentenced under subsection (c)(2) hereof, if within
three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer

vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,

section unless the court is presented with current proof of financial
responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
   (f)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

501.06 LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is

   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

501.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
 
501.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
 
501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
 
501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
 
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
 
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
 
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
 
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
 
501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
 
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
 
501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
         E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for
the victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion,
or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11  shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
Type of                                       Maximum
Misdemeanor                                   Fine
First degree                                  $ 5000.00
Second degree                              4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                              2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).
         (ORC 2929.31; A.O.)
 
   (d)   Points. With the exception of violations under Section
 335.01 of the Codified Ordinances where no points shall be assessed, all other
moving violations that are not specifically outlined and assigned points
through Ohio Revised Code Section 4510.036, the court shall assess 2 points.

first shall be applied to pay the expenses incurred with regard to the care of
the animal from the time it was taken from the custody of the former owner. The
balance of the proceeds from the sale, if any, shall be paid to the former
owner of the animal.

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.

the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind

difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

545.02 DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense. If

violations of Section
545.05 or
545.15, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services. (ORC 2913.61)
545.03 PROPERTY EXCEPTIONS AS FELONY OFFENSE.
   Regardless of the value of the property involved, and regardless of whether
the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

545.18 do not apply if the property involved is any of the following:

905.01 ESTABLISHMENT OF GRADE; SPECIFICATIONS.
   Whenever Council decides to provide for the construction or repair of any
specific sidewalks, curbings or gutters, or parts thereof, other than by
special assessments, it shall require the Director of Service and Safety to
proceed as follows:
   (a)   To establish the line and grade to be adhered to in such construction
work. If the grade of the sidewalk, curbing or gutter is already established,
such repair or new construction shall conform therewith, unless a new or
different grade is desired. The grade in all cases shall refer to the elevation
of the top or upper surface of the existing or contemplated curb.
If no grade has previously been established, or if a change of grade is
contemplated, the Director shall cause such grade to be established or re-
established and monumented with line and grade stakes and shall cause plats to
be prepared and filed in his office indicating such line and grade as
established in outline and profile with the intersecting lot lines, frontages
and the names and addresses of all abutting owners. Unless otherwise provided,
the upper surface of a sidewalk shall be approximately level with the grade at
every point.
In all cases where a new or different grade is established, the Director shall
notify each owner who will be affected thereby, by written notice of such
establishment or change in grade, and of the fact that plats have been prepared
and are on file in his office, subject to the owner's inspection. Such notice
shall be served on all residents of the City in the manner provided by law for
the service of summons in a civil action with a copy thereof to be returned to
the Director endorsed by the officer or person serving it stating the time and
manner of service. Service on nonresidents and persons not found may be made by
publication of the notice once in a newspaper of general circulation in the
Municipality. At any time within ten days following completion of service of
such notice, any such owner shall have the right of appeal of such order of
establishment or change of grade to Council, which shall hear such appeal and
render its decision by majority vote, which shall be final.
   (b)   After the grade for such improvement has been established, the
Director shall prepare and cause to be filed in his office, plans and
specifications for the construction or repair contemplated, setting forth
clearly the scope of the work, with full dimensions, the type, quality and
quantity of materials and workmanship required, methods of construction to be
employed and such other matters as may be appropriate. Cement for such
construction shall consist of at least one part of cement to two parts of clean
sand and four parts of clean gravel or stone.
      (Ord. 3267. Passed 3-13-68.)
 
905.02 RESOLUTION OF COUNCIL; NOTICE.
   Council, by resolution, may approve all or any sectional part of the plans
and specifications referred to in Section
905.01(b), and order the construction or repair of the specified sidewalk,
curbing or gutter. A written notice of the passage of such resolution shall be
given to the owner or agent of the owner of each parcel of land abutting upon
such improvement in the manner provided in Ohio R. C. 729.03.

employees or agents, shall construct or repair any sidewalk, curbing or gutter
without first obtaining a permit from such Director to do so. The fee for such
permit shall be a minimum of five dollars ($5.00) for fifty square feet or
less. For those projects in excess of fifty square feet, the fee shall be five
dollars ($5.00) for the next estimated 500 square feet and five dollars ($5.00)
additional for those projects larger than 550 square feet.
(Ord. 77-23. Passed 5-10-77.)
 
905.04 PERMIT APPLICATION.
   Each application for a permit shall be made in writing by the person
employed to do the work, specifying the work to be done, and shall be signed by
the applicant and the owner.
(Ord. 3267. Passed 3-13-68.)
 
905.05 APPLICANT'S QUALIFICATIONS; BOND REQUIRED.
   Each applicant for a permit shall be experienced and qualified, in the
opinion of the Director of Service and Safety to do the work contemplated in
full accordance with the City's requirements. Applicants shall give bond in an
amount to be determined by the Director, but in no case less than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) for new construction, or one hundred dollars ($100.00) for
repair work with sufficient surety, conditioned that such applicant will fully
indemnify the City and save it harmless from loss or damage occasioned to it,
directly or indirectly, from any act or omission in the performance of any such
work, and that he will replace and restore to their pre-existing conditions any
portion of any street, curbing, sidewalk or other City owned or controlled
property which may be disturbed or interfered with by him in such construction.
In the event the applicant and owner are the same person and the work specified
to be done in the permit is upon the owner's property and no other, then in
such cases the surety requirements shall not apply.
(Ord. 3267. Passed 3-13-68.)
 
905.06 SUPERVISION OF CONSTRUCTION.
   Upon granting of a permit for the construction of the improvement, the
permittee shall proceed immediately with the improvement contemplated by the
resolution of Council referred to in Section
905.02 and shall complete the same without unnecessary delay. The Director of
Service and Safety shall supervise the construction or repair and shall see
that the work has been faithfully performed according to plans and
specifications before final approval.
(Ord. 3267. Passed 3-13-68.)
 
905.07 FAILURE OF OWNER TO ACT ON NOTICE.
   After fifteen days from the date of completion of notice to the owner of the
resolution referred to in Section
905.02, if no application for a permit is pending and no permit has been
granted to or on behalf of any owner, the Director of Service and Safety or
Council, shall proceed to construct or repair the sidewalks at the expense of
such owner or employ a contract to perform such work at the owner's expense.
All expenses so incurred shall be assessed on such abutting property. Such
assessment shall be collected in the same manner, with a penalty of five
percent and interest for failure to pay at the time fixed by the assessing
ordinance, as in the case of improvements.
(Ord. 3267. Passed 3-13-68.)
 
905.08 REBUILDING REQUIRED.
   No person shall construct or repair any sidewalk, curb or gutter without a
permit duly issued, or not in conformity with the grade as established, or with
workmanship or materials not in conformity with the required specifications.
Council shall order any such unlawfully constructed sidewalk, curbing or gutter
to be destroyed and rebuilt by the owner of the abutting property in conformity
with the provisions of this chapter, and upon failure of such owner to comply
with such order within fifteen days Council shall provide for such destruction
and rebuilding and shall assess all costs for the same on such owner as
provided in Section
905.07.
(Ord. 3267. Passed 3-13-68.)

person or damage to property, by reason of the failure of such owner, lessee,
occupant, person or agent in charge, to maintain the sidewalk in good repair
and free from any defect.
 
   (b)   If by reason of the failure of such owner, occupant, lessee, person or
agent in charge, as referred to in subsection (a) above, to maintain the
sidewalk in good repair and free of any defect, a claim is made or a money
judgment obtained against the City, by any person sustaining injury for failure
to repair or maintain a sidewalk free of any defect, the owner, occupant,
lessee, person or agent in charge, shall be liable to and reimburse the City
for all money paid by the City on any claim made or judgment obtained against
the City, by any person injured by reason thereof.
(Ord. 94-40. Passed 4-26-94.)

1103  of the Codified Ordinances, the developer and/or owner shall either plant
or retain sufficient trees so that between the paved portion of the street and
the line running parallel to and fifty feet from the centerline of the street,
there is for every thirty feet of street frontage at least an average of one
deciduous tree that has or will have when fully mature a trunk at least twelve
inches in diameter.

with a trunk of eighteen inches in diameter or more unless the retention of
such trees would unreasonably burden the development in the opinion of the City
Engineer.

the drip line of any tree with a trunk of eighteen inches in diameter or more,
and no impervious surface (including, but not limited to, paving or buildings)

development if, to accomplish such retention or protection, the desired
location of improvements on a lot or the proposed activities on a lot would
have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work an unreasonable
hardship upon the developer, in the opinion of the City Engineer.

section places an unreasonable burden on the development, the City Engineer may
allow replacement with like trees in areas unaffected by the improvements, as
an alternative to keeping the existing trees in question.

owners of fifty percent (50%) or more of the abutting foot frontage to be
served by the proposed extension, accompanied by payment of five dollars
($5.00) per linear abutting front foot of property owned by the petitioners.
When an extension has been constructed in accordance with this procedure, water
tap connections to such extension shall be permitted only to serve premises for
which the front foot charge has been made at the time of filing the petition,
provided that the owners of other property abutting the extension may be
permitted to make a tap or connection upon payment of a sum equal to five
dollars and fifty cents ($5.50) per linear abutting front foot of the premises
owned by them. No part of the payment made in accordance with this procedure
shall be refunded in any case.
(Ord. 3618. Passed 6-20-72.)
 
923.03 WATER MAIN EXTENSION; INSTALLATION PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Construction. Except as specifically provided by ordinance, all
construction of water main extensions in streets and ways not already supplied
with water shall be in accordance with one of the following procedures:
      (1)   Procedure 1. Payment of the entire cost in advance. Any one or more
property owners may request the Water Department to determine the feasibility
and the estimated cost of the construction of a proposed water main extension
to serve his or their premises. If such a request is approved, and the
estimated cost is determined, such property owner or owners shall deposit with
the Department a sum equal to the estimated cost, and the requested extension
shall thereupon be constructed. Any surplus in the deposit over and above the
construction cost shall be refunded to the owners or their agents. Should the
construction cost exceed the deposit, the owner or owners shall pay the excess
amount, the agreement for which shall be made at the time of the original
deposit. No water tap shall be made or water service rendered until the cost is
paid in full.
      (2)   Procedure 2. Construction by owners. In undedicated streets and in
new subdivisions the Water Department may permit an owner or owners to arrange
for the laying of water main extensions by private contract; the performance of
work, however, shall be done under the supervision and control of the
Department. In the construction of any extension, the plans must have prior
approval by the Department, and only duly inspected and approved materials
shall be permitted. A contractor shall be required to furnish bond, either cash
or surety, as a guarantee against defective workmanship or materials, and he
shall be required to pay for inspection and supervision of the work unless
otherwise exempted by the Department.
      (3)   Procedure 3. Fifty percent petition. In case of existing dedicated
streets, the Water Department shall be authorized to construct water main
extensions where practicable upon application of the owners of fifty percent
(50%) or more of the abutting foot frontage to be served by the proposed
extension, accompanied by payment of two dollars ($2.00) per linear abutting
front foot of property owned by the petitioners. When an extension has been
constructed in accordance with Procedure 3, water tap connections to such
extension shall be permitted only to serve premises for which the front foot
charge has been made at the time of filing the petition, provided that owners
of other property abutting the extension may be permitted to make a tap or
connection upon payment of a sum equal to two dollars and twenty cents ($2.20)
per linear abutting front foot of the premises owned by them. No part of the
payment made in accordance with Procedure 3 shall be refunded in any case.
      (4)   Procedure 4. Constructing without petition. When it has been
determined by the Water Department that it is in the best interest of the water
distribution system, and funds are appropriated for the same by Council,
construction of a water main extension connecting two or more existing mains
shall be accomplished. After the completion of such an extension, any premises
abutting the streets or way in which such extension is laid may be permitted to
have a tap or service connection made to such main upon payment, with the
application for such tap or service connection, of an amount equal to sixty
percent of the cost of a linear foot, of the particular extension, per linear
abutting front foot of the premises to be served. The Department under
Procedure 4 will determine the per-linear-foot cost of the completed extension.
No water service will be rendered in any case to any premises until such
payment of frontage and service connection charges has been made in full.
      (5)   Procedure 5. Assessment in accordance with Ohio Revised Code. The
owners of property to be served by a proposed water main extension may petition
for the construction of such an extension and the assessment of the cost
thereof in accordance with provisions of the Ohio Revised Code.
 
   (b)   Extensions Beyond Corporate Limits. The Water Department may extend
water mains beyond the corporate limits of the City only with the authority of
Council, and in all cases such an extension shall be made in accordance with
Procedure 1 or Procedure 2 of this section. In any case such extension shall be
effected only by written agreement, and in all cases the right of recovery of
any or all of the costs of such installation of a main extension shall be
waived.
 
   (c)   Ownership and Control. All main extensions, regardless of the
procedure employed, shall become the property of and under the control of the
Water Department, unless sspecifically exempted by ordinance.
 
   (d)   Further Extensions. The Water Department shall have the right and
authority to further extend any extension, under any of the procedures set
forth herein, to serve additional premises beyond any earlier or original
extension of a main without reimbursement to anyone who might have contributed
to an earlier or original extension of a main.
 
   (e)   Estimated Cost. The determination of the estimated cost of any
proposed extension of a main, will include all items of materials and labor,
including any extraordinary costs occasioned by the opening of pavements, or
street surfacing, rock digging and frost, together with allowances thereon for
engineering and general office expense pertaining to the purchase, storage,
delivery and installation of all materials and equipment necessary to construct
an extension, except that the costs so determined will not include charges
occasioned by a water main larger than would be necessary to meet the
customer's estimated normal requirements, but in no case will computations of
costs be based on a main of less than six inches inside diameter.
 
   (f)   New Subdivisions. Main extensions into a new real estate subdivision
shall not be permitted until the plat of such subdivision is approved by the
City Planning Commission and the acceptance of such subdivision assured by
Council.

solids, and not more than 250 parts per million of BOD, and not more than 20
parts per million of ammonia.
         B.   "Suspended solids" means solids that either float on the surface
of, or are in suspension in, water, sewage, or other liquids, and which are
removable by laboratory filtering.
         C.   "BOD" (denoting biochemical oxygen demand) means the quantity of
oxygen utilized in the biochemical oxidation of organic matter, under standard
laboratory procedures, in five days at twenty degrees Centigrade, expressed in
parts per million by weight.
         D.   Ammonia means a chemical combination of hydrogen (H) and nitrogen
(N) occurring extensively in nature. The combination used in wastewater is
expressed as NH3.
      (2)   Sewage or industrial wastes above normal sewage strength but
acceptable for discharge into the sanitary sewage system shall be subject to a
monthly surcharge. The surcharge shall be determined on the basis of either or
each of the three constituents of the water or wastes:
         A.   Total suspended solids, and/or
         B.    Five-day BOD at twenty degrees Centigrade and/or
         C.    Ammonia and as herein provided.
      (3)   When the total suspended solids, BOD or ammonia of a water or waste
accepted for admission to the system exceeds the values of these constituents
for normal sewage, the excess concentration in either or any as the case may
be, shall be subject to a surcharge as follows:
         A.   Pounds* of excess suspended solids per day x $0.10 per pound = SS
surcharge.
         B.    Pounds* of excess BOD per day x $0.10 per pound = BOD surcharge.
         C.   Pounds* of excess ammonia per day x $0.25 per pound = ammonia
surcharge.
(*The flow figure used for this determination will be either a metered
wastewater flow, a metered water usage or an agreed upon constant.)
      (4)   In addition to the surcharge, the service charge on all industrial
wastes discharged to the sewage system for sewage treatment service by the City
shall be the charge specified in the current City ordinance pertaining to sewer
service charges of the City. In addition, all industrial users shall pay all
applicable surcharges and penalties as stated and defined in this chapter.
Failure to pay these charges shall be considered a violation of this chapter.
      (5)   The pounds of BOD per day and/or pounds of suspended solids and/or
pounds of ammonia per day above the concentrations previously described for
normal strength sewage that are discharged to the sewage system shall be
determined by the City or its authorized representative.

to the wastewater treatment system shall maintain such records of production
and related factors, effluent flows, and pollutant amounts and concentrations
of such pollutants that are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the
requirements of this chapter and any applicable State or federal pretreatment
standards or requirements.
 
   (b)   The Discharger shall allow the Service Director or his representative
to enter upon the premises of the Discharger during any reasonable hour for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, and records examination and copying to
determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Where the industry
has security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry, the discharger shall make necessary arrangements so
that the Service Director or his representative will be permitted entry without
delay. The City shall have the right to set up on the discharger's property
necessary devices to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring,
metering operations, or all of these.
 
   (c)   If so ordered by the City, the owner or operator of any premises or
facility discharging industrial wastes into the system shall install at his own
cost and expense suitable monitoring equipment to facilitate the accurate
observation, sampling, and measurement of wastes. Such equipment shall be
maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times.
 
   (d)   The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the City may allow such
facility to be constructed in the public right of way, with the approval of the
public agency having jurisdiction of such right of way, and located so that it
will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping, or parked vehicles.
 
   (e)   When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the City
may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each user. When
there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the City may
require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each discharge.
 
   (f)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the City requirements and
all applicable construction standards and specifications.
 
   (g)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
      (1)   Except as indicated in subsections (g)(2) and (3) below, the User
must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the Director. Where time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be
representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance,
multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures
as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
Instantaneous Limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
periodic compliance reports required in Section
925.18(b) and
925.18(g) [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be
used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
Director may authorize a lower minimum. For the periodic compliance reports
required by City and 40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h), the Industrial User is
required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure
compliance by with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.
 
   (h)   Laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques established is 40 CFR Part 136
entitled "Guidelines for Establishing Test Procedures for the Analysis of
Pollutants." Analysis of those pollutants not covered by this publication shall
be performed in accordance with the current edition of "Standard Methods,"
"Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water and Waste," published by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, or the "Annual Book of Standards, Part 23,
Water, Atmospheric Analysis," published by the American Society for Testing and
Materials. Analysis of these pollutants not covered by these publications shall
be performed in accordance with procedures established by the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency. If a significant industrial user's sampling
data indicates a violation of any parameters listed in the discharge period,
the industrial user must notify the City within twenty-four hours of becoming
aware of the violation. The significant industrial user must then repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results to the City within thirty days.
   (i)   Sampling of industrial wastewater for the purpose of compliance
determination with respect to the prohibition and limitations stated in Section
925.05 will be done at such intervals as designated by the City. Users subject
to the reporting requirements of this ordinance shall retain, and make
available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this ordinance, any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the User independent of such requirements, and documentation
associated with Best Management Practices established under Section
925.18(d). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the User
or the City, or where the User has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Director.
   (j)   Industrial users are required to provide an access point in order to
sample the wastewater discharge.
   (k)   At any reasonable time, duly authorized representatives of the City
bearing proper credentials and identifications shall be permitted to enter all
properties for the purposes of inspection, observation, measurement, sampling,
and testing pertinent to discharge to the community system in accordance with
the provisions of this chapter.
   (l)   Information and data furnished to the City with respect to the nature
and frequency of discharge shall be available to the public or other government
agency without restriction unless the discharger specifically requests and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the release of such
information would divulge trade secrets or proprietary information. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential
information. Information accepted by the City as confidential shall be made
available to governmental agencies upon request.
   (m)   While performing necessary work for private properties referred to
above, the City or duly authorized employees of the City shall observe all

(Ord. 19-82. Passed 12-10-19.)
 
925.20 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)    Emergency Suspension of Service and Discharge Permits. The City may
for good cause suspend the wastewater treatment service to a Discharger when it
appears to the City that an actual or threatened discharge presents or
threatens an imminent or substantial danger to the environment, interferes with
the operation of the POTW, or violates any pretreatment limits imposed by this
chapter. Any Discharger notified ofthe suspension of the City's wastewater
treatment service shall within a reasonable period oftime, as determined by the
City, cease all discharges. In the event of failure of the Discharger to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order within the specified time, the City shall
commence judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the Discharger's
compliance with such order. The City shall reinstate the wastewater treatment
service and terminate judicial proceedings pending proof by the Discharger of
the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or conditions creating the threat
of imminent or substantial danger as set forth above.
   (b)    Revocation of Treatment Services. The City may seek to terminate the
wastewater treatment services to any Discharger which fails to:
      (1)    Factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics
of its discharge;
      (2)   Report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics;
      (3)    Refuses reasonable access to the Discharger's premises by
representatives of the City for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; and
      (4)    Violates the conditions of this chapter, or any final judicial
order entered with respect thereto.
   (c)    Notification of Violation; Administrative Adjustment. Whenever the
City finds that any Discharger has engaged in conduct which justifies
termination of a wastewater treatment service, pursuant to subsection (b)
hereof, the City shall serve or cause to be served upon such Discharger, a
written notice either personally or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged violation. Within seven
days of the date of receipt of the notice, the Discharger shall respond
personally or in writing to the City, advising of its position with respect to
the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain the veracity
of the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan for the satisfactory
correction thereof.
   (d)    Show Cause Hearing. Where the violation of subsection (c) hereof is
not corrected by timely compliance by means of administration adjustment, the
City may order any Discharger which causes or allows conduct prohibited by
subsection (b) hereof, to show cause before the City or its duly authorized
representative, why the proposed service termination action should not be
taken. A written notice shall be served on the Discharger by personal service,
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, specifying the time and
place of hearing to be held by the City or its designee regarding the
violation, the reasons why the enforcement action is to be taken, the proposed
enforcement action, and directing the Discharger to show cause before the City
or its designee why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the hearing shall be served no less than ten days before the hearing.
Service may be made on any agent, officer, or authorized representative of a
Discharger. The proceedings at the hearing shall be considered by the City
which shall then enter appropriate orders with respect to the alleged improper
activities of the Discharger. Appeal of such orders may be taken by the
Discharger in accordance with applicable local or State law.
   (e)    Judicial Proceedings. Following the entry of any order by the City
with respect to the conduct of a Discharger contrary to the provisions of
subsection (b) hereof, the attorney for the City may, following the
authorization of such action by the City, commence an action for appropriate
legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate local court.
   (f)    Enforcement Actions; Annual Publication. At least annually, the
Director shall publish a list of all industrial users which at any time during
the previous twelve months were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment requirements. For the purposes of this provision, an industrial
user is in significant noncompliance if its violations meet one or more of the
following criteria:
      (1)    Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all of the measurements taken
during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or
the average limit for the same pollutant parameter;
      (2)    Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of all ofthe measurements for each
pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period equal or exceed the product
of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable
TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil and grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH);
      (3)    Any other violation of a pretreatment effluent limit (daily
maximum or longer term average, instantaneous and/or narrative standards) that
the Director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering the health of
POTW personnel or the general public);
      (4)    Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
of human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)    Failure to meet, within ninety days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
      (6)    Failure to provide, within thirty days after the due date,
required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety days compliance
reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules.
      (7)    Failure to accurately report noncompliance;
      (8)    Any other violation or group of violations which the Director
determines will or or or has adversely affected the operation or implementation
of the City's pretreatment program.
Chronic and Technical Review Criteria only apply to Significant Industrial
Users.
However, other SNC criteria can be grounds for finding a Non-Significant
Industrial User in SNC.
   (g)    Right of Appeal.  Any Discharger or any interested party shall have
the right to request in writing an interpretation of ruling by the City on any
matter covered by this chapter and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply.
In the event that such inquiry is by a Discharger and deals with matters of
performance or compliance with this chapter for which enforcement activity
relating to an alleged violation is the subject, receipt of a Discharger's
request, shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the
aforesaid written reply. Appeal of any final judicial order entered pursuant to
this chapter may be taken in accordance with local and State law.
   (h)    Operating Upsets. Any Discharger which experiences an upset in
operations which places the Discharger in a temporary state of noncompliance
with this chapter shall inform the City thereof immediately after becoming
aware of the commencement of the upset. Where such information is given orally,
a written follow-up report thereof shall be filed by the Discharger with the
City within five days. The report shall specify:
      (1)    Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset's impact
on a Discharger's compliance status.
      (2)    Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur.
      (3)    All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of or has adversely affected the operation or implementation of the
City's pretreatment program.
Chronic and Technical Review Criteria only apply to Significant Industrial
Users. However, other SNC criteria can be grounds for finding a Non-Significant
Industrial User in SNC.
   (i)    Enforcement Actions; Compliance Schedule. When in the opinion of the
Director, it becomes necessary for Industrial Users to install technology or
provide additional operation and maintenance (0 and M) to meet any condition of
this chapter or applicable administrative order, the Director shall require the
development of the shortest schedule by which the Industrial User will provide
this additional technology or 0 and M.
      (1)    The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of
dates for the commencement and completion of major events. Under no
circumstances shall any increment exceed nine months.
      (2)    Not later than fourteen days following each date in the schedule
and the final date for compliance, the Industrial User shall submit a progress
report to the Director including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with
the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which
it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and
the steps being taken to return to the schedule established.
      (3)    No later than fourteen days following each date in the schedule
and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to
the Director including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the
increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it
expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and
the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule
established. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such
progress reports to the Director.
   (j)   Definition of Significant Noncompliance (SNC). Any violation of
pretreatment requirements (limits, sampling, analysis, reporting and meeting
compliance schedules, and regulatory deadlines) is an instance of noncompliance
for which the industrial user is liable for enforcement, including penalties.
However, there is a need to identify violations or patterns of violations by
industrial users that are instances of Significant Noncompliance. This
classification allows the MIPP contractor and City to establish priorities for
formal enforcement actions. Instances of SNC are industrial user violations
which meet one or more of the following criteria:
      (1)   Violations of wastewater discharge limits.
         A.   Chronic violations. Sixty-six percent or more of the measurements
exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit in a 6 month
period (any magnitude of exceedence).
         B.   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations. Thirty-three percent
or more of the measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same
average limit by more than the TRC in a 6 month period. There are two groups of
TRC criteria:
Group I (conventional pollutants BOD, TSS, oil & grease) TRC = 1.4
Group II (all other pollutants) TRC = 1.2
         C.   Any other violation(s) of an effluent limit (average, daily
maximum or instantaneous and/or narrative standards that the Control Authority
believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference (i.e. slug loads) or pass-through; or endangered the health of the
sewage treatment personnel or the public.
         D.   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused endangerment to
human health/welfare or to the environment and has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.
      (2)   Violations of compliance milestones, contained in a local control
mechanism or enforcement order, for starting construction, completing
construction and attaining final compliance by 90 days or more after the
schedule date.
      (3)   Failure to provide reports for compliance schedules, self-
monitoring data or categorical standards (baseline monitoring reports, 90 day
compliance reports and periodic reports) within 45 days from the due date.
      (4)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
      (5)   Any other violation or group ofviolations (includes violations of
BMPs) that the City considers to be significant or has adversely affected the
operation or implementation of the pretreatment program.
   Chronic and Technical Review Criteria only apply to Significant Industrial
Users. However, other SNC criteria can be grounds for finding a Non-Significant
Industrial User in SNC.

(Ord. 07-01. Passed 2-15-07.)
LAND USE GUIDELINES
The City is fortunate to own a significant amount of property at the Airport.
This provides room for not only for runway extensions, but also for hangar
construction and aeronautical commercial development.
The Airport Master Plan proposed by R.W. Armstrong sets forth the parameters of
future Airport development and land use. The Airport Layout Plan is attached as
Exhibit A. The Terminal Area Plan is attached as Exhibit B.
Generally speaking, the areas contiguous to the existing apron and near the
Main Hangar/Terminal Building are to be reserved for aeronautical commercial
activity, such as, airplane leasing, flight training, aircraft repairs, charter
service and other airport support activities.
Current traffic and based counts far exceed both FAA and State forecast
information, and based upon user survey results, the trend for continued growth
at Bellefontaine Regional Airport should remain strong. This growth trend in
aircraft operations, when combined with the increased in size and speed of
aircraft using and expected to used the Airport, has been used to identify a
strategy of phased development, which will allow the Airport to expand
incrementally while simultaneously protecting against incompatible land uses in
the path of future development. Details of this strategy can be found in the
2006 Bellefontaine Regional Airport Master Plan Update.
954.08 PLANNING.
   (a)   One approach to land use management involves the use of existing
policies and development guidelines available through a number of different
planning processes. For airports, these occur at several levels. The various
levels of planning include airport system planning, regional and community
comprehensive planning, airport master planning, integrated multi-modal
planning, and capital improvement programs. Solutions to the land use issues
that arise in communities surrounding airports must be incorporated into the
airport and community planning and development process. The City can work
closely with the appropriate state agencies to insure optimal airport layout
and conformity with various laws and regulations.
   (b)   Integrating airport planning at the three different levels can aid in
the process of developing a compatible land use plan. The airport system plan,
regional and community comprehensive plans, and airport master plan can proceed
independently, but the value of each is increased when one provides input into
the other.
(Ord. 07-01. Passed 2-15-07.)
954.09 OHIO AVIATION SYSTEM PLAN.
   (a)   Responding to the growth in aviation, the federal government enacted
the Airport and Airways Development Act of 1970 to assist state and local
authorities in the planning and development of airports of national interest.
The general intent of the act was that each state should have a plan for the
systematic development of such airports, with federal government participating
financially in the preparation of the plan as well as in subsequent facility
development.
   (b)   The Ohio Aviation System Plan (OASP) has been prepared and is updated
every five to seven years to guide decision making at the state and local
levels. System planning considers the local airport as part of a network of
airports which provides air transportation activities for a large area such as
a nation, state, or a region. The important factor in system planning is the
determination of the general location and function of airports to provide safe
and efficient service into the future.
   (c)   In addition, the OASP provides data on Ohio airports to the FAA for
use in evaluating possible inclusion in the National Plan of Integrated Airport
Systems (NPIAS). Inclusion in the NPIAS makes the state's airports eligible for
federal development assistance.
   (d)   Complimentary to the statewide system plan, reliever studies have been
carried out to develop more specific system plans for a number of the major
urban areas in Ohio.
   (e)   The Ohio Airport System consists of 110 public use airports, including
eight proposed new airports, and two proposed new heliports, for a total of 112
facilities. These facilities are owned by various counties, municipalities, a
township, and private individuals.
(Ord. 07-01. Passed 2-15-07.)
954.10 COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING.
   (a)   Regional and Community comprehensive planning occur at the local
level. The City's comprehensive plan establishes policies for the development
and improvement of the community. Here the airport is considered not only in
terms of its impact on transportation, but also in terms of its effect on the
local economy, land use, and environment. The airport should be incorporated
into the total transportation plan to meet the community's needs. Especially
important in this respect is access to the airport by road, rail, and public
transportation, where appropriate.
   (b)   The primary purpose of the City's comprehensive plan with respect to
the local airport should be to support the efficient operation of the airport.
Within the land use element of the comprehensive plan, the future plan should
show the land area required for airport purposes and designate land uses for
surrounding properties that are compatible with airport operations. The general
location and extent of designated uses should be based on a forecast of demand
for various types of development and a consideration of the likely
characteristics of such development.
   (c)   Communities with comprehensive plans that contain an airport component
are more likely to be successful in achieving land uses compatible with the
local airport. The comprehensive plan provides a legal basis for airport land
uses and community consensus in support of the airport's existing and future
operations.
(Ord. 07-01. Passed 2-15-07.)
954.11 AIRPORT MASTER PLANNING.
   (a)   Airport master planning means the level of planning relating directly
to airport facilities. The airport master plan includes an analysis of the
specific improvements necessary to provide the proper level of service for the
forecast demand.
   (b)   The airport master planning process should identify the impact of
airport operations on land use in the vicinity and recommend actions to
alleviate negative impacts. The master plan will also show the areas for which
fee simple land acquisitions and easements should be obtained. In fact,
Congress has required an airport sponsor requesting federal aid under the
Airport Improvement Program (AIP) to show the actions taken to restrict the use
of land adjacent to, or in the immediate vicinity of the airport, to activities
and purposes compatible with normal airport operations. In additions, the
sponsor must specify how this has been accomplished by providing information on
any zoning laws enacted or in force restricting the use of land adjacent to or
in the vicinity of the airport.
   (c)   The Airport Layout Plan (ALP) is the technical section of the master
plan depicting the specific development of the airport's facilities. Of the
seven required drawing, one solely depicts the noise contours associated with
airport use and the recommended development pattern for land surrounding the
airport.
   (d)   The airport master plan is a very useful document to incorporate into
the local comprehensive planning process and subsequent local land use
policies. The Bellefontaine Regional Airport Master Plan and ALP were updated
in 2006.
(Ord. 07-01. Passed 2-15-07.)
954.12 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLANNING.
   (a)   Capital improvement programming is an important means by which
comprehensive planning is realized, and is vital to areas where large tracts of
vacant land have yet to be developed.
   (b)   Types of funding available to airport sponsors for capital improvement
programming include:
      (1)   United States Government
      (2)   State of Ohio
      (3)   Local
         A.   General obligation Bonds
         B.   Revenue Bonds
         C.   Private Financing
         D.   Nonprofit Corporation Bonds
         E.   Industrial Development Authority
         F.   Retained Revenues
            (Ord. 07-01. Passed 2-15-07.)
954.13 ZONING.
   Airport zoning is to be handled separately. The zoning issues will involve
airport Airspace Zoning and Land Use Zoning. Airspace Zoning will be
administered by the Logan County Commissioners and will extend beyond the City
corporation limit. The Land Use Zoning will be handled through the City's
Zoning Code and will address land within the City corporation.
(Ord. 07-01. Passed 2-15-07.)
LEASE AGREEMENT GUIDELINES
954.14 AGRICULTURAL LEASE.
   (a)   The Bellefontaine Regional Airport has approximately 247 acres
available for agricultural use. These areas are not to be developed due to
proximity to the runway and clear zones.
   (b)   The City of Bellefontaine advertises for bids for lease of said
property for agricultural use. The bids are for a three year period.
   (c)   Agricultural lessees are required to conform with all airport safety
regulations and coordinate activities with the Airport Manager.
   (d)   A model Agricultural Lease is attached.
(Ord. 07-01. Passed 2-15-07.)
954.15 LAND LEASE.
   (a)   The arrangements between the airport owner and those private agencies
seeking to offer commodities and services at the airport are to be expressed in
a contract. Since most of these contracts involve the right to occupy and use
designated premises, they will generally be in the form of a lease. As in any
such agreement the rental payments, terms of occupancy, privileges granted,
obligations assumed, and other considerations are a matter of bargaining and
negotiation between the parties. There are, however, some general principles
peculiar to the airport environment which should be given careful
consideration.
   (b)   If the prospective tenant contemplates a substantial capital
investment in hangars, fuel storage equipment, machinery, and store fixtures,
etc, he or she will seek a relatively long term lease in order to be able to
amortize his or her investment. It is to the advantage of the airport owner to
encourage such private development and to offer sufficient tenure to induce it.
On the other hand, aviation is dynamic and airports evolve and expand faster
than anticipated. In leasing airport property to commercial tenants, it would
be well to avoid leasing more than is reasonably required. Similarly the
granting of options (to lease land not yet needed) may well turn out to the be
the most regretted concession made during initial negotiations.
   (c)   A commercial tenant when contemplating a substantial investment at an
airport will naturally seek some form of protection from competition. The
airport owner if fact may be under considerable pressure during the
negotiations to lease airport premises under terms which guarantee an exclusive
monopoly. However, the City should realize that any exclusive right to conduct
an “aeronautical activity” could make the City ineligible for various forms of
Federal assistance. Federal law prohibits the granting of an exclusive right to
conduct an aeronautical activity at any airport on which Federal funds have
been expended. However, there are alternate legal means of giving adequate
protection to a commercial aeronautical enterprise at a public airport.
Advisory Circular 150/5190-A, Minimum Standards for Commercial Aeronautical
Activities on Public Airports, describes in detail how an airport owner may,
and should, enforce standards of quality and levels of service, including
capital equipment. Such standards are very effective in excluding marginal or
irresponsible competitive operations so there should be no compelling reason to
lease airport facilities on an exclusive basis. The legal prohibition against
airport monopolies does not apply to non-aeronautical activities such as
restaurants, taxicabs, limousines, etc.
   (d)   In negotiating a lease on airport premises, it is desirable to keep in
mind the nature of the rights and privileges to be conferred for the rentals or
other considerations to be paid. The following describe conditions that
aeronautical tenants usually seek when developing and negotiating a lease:
      (1)   The lease of specified premises for as long a term as it can.
      (2)   The right to conduct at those premises a wide range of activities
with as little restriction as possible.
      (3)   The rights, for itself and its customers, to use in common with
others the runways, taxiways, and other public facilities of the airport.
   (e)   A good lease will reflect thoughtful consideration of each of these
objectives.
      (1)   The lease of land or specific premises should be for a term long
enough to amortize the investment to which the tenant will be committed. It
should be for a firm rental rate. It should clearly spell out the respective
housekeeping and insurance responsibilities of each party. If renewal options
are contemplated there may be provision for the airport owner to terminate the
lease upon reimbursing the tenant for the unamortized value of installed
improvements. Above all, the lease should be consistent with the master plan
for phased airport development and land use.
      (2)   The agreement or lease should clearly identify what the tenant is
permitted to do. This represents a franchise right to conduct a business of
offering commodities and services to those attracted to the airport. It should
cite the applicable standards, codes, or ordinances covering the exercise of
the patronage at the airport.
   (f)   A model Land Lease Agreement is Attached.
   (g)   The price charged for land under the Agreement should reflect the
costs incurred
by the City with regard to acquisition and development and the costs to be
incurred by the Lessee with regard to improvements. Particular note should be
made of private improvements which may benefit the airport in general or if
excessive costs are associated with making the land accessible.
   (h)   Based upon other airport land use rates, costs incurred by the city
and other development considerations the recommended cost per square foot for
land lease at the Bellefontaine Regional Airport is between twenty to forty
cents (.20-.40).
   (i)   The Airport Minimum Standards should be adhered to with regard to land
leases and private development. However, each lease may present unique
circumstances supporting a deviation from the Minimum Standards.
(Ord. 07-01. Passed 2-15-07.)
954.16 T-HANGAR LEASES.
   (a)   In 2006 there are three (3) T-Hangar buildings housing twenty eight
(28) individual T-Hangar units. Two buildings house twenty (10 each) single-
engine aircraft units and one building houses eight (8) twin-engine aircraft
units.
   (b)   The T-Hangars are owned and operated by the City of Bellefontaine. The
Airport Manager shows the units to potential lessees and maintains the common
areas as part of his regular duties, but does not share in any rental revenue
derived therefrom.
   (c)   T-Hangar rental fees were first established in 2002 for the single-
engine aircraft units. In July, 2006 fees were adjusted for inflation based
upon the Midwest Consumer Price Index. Also, fees were established at that time
for the twin-engine aircraft units.
   (d)   It is recommended that the T-Hangar Rental Fees be examined every
three to five years for warranted increases based upon the Midwest Consumer
Price Index for all categories.
   (e)   Future T-Hangar development is illustrated in Exhibit B and discussed
in the Airport Master Plan.
   (f)   A model T-Hangar Rental Agreement is attached.

other requirements of this Chapter.
   (b)   The following general requirements shall apply to all Wireless
Communication Facilities regardless of the zoning district in which they are to
be located. These general requirements may be supplemented with regulations
that specifically apply to uses stated to be permitted and conditional uses.
Any such supplemental regulations are listed in this Chapter for the specific
zoning districts to which they apply:
      (1)   General Requirements:
         A.   The maximum Tower or Antenna Height permitted within the City is
two hundred (200) feet unless otherwise stated in this Chapter. The Planning
Commission may waive this requirement depending on the requirements of the
zoning district in which the facility is to be located and the surrounding
environment of the location for the facility.
         B.   A Wireless Communication Facility tower or antenna as defined in
this Chapter that is mounted to an existing communications tower (whether such
communications tower is for personal communications services uses or not),
smoke stack or water tower or other tall structure, shall be permitted uses in
all zoning districts of the City of Bellefontaine. Wireless Communication
Facilities antennas may also be located on the top of buildings, which are
themselves no less than fifty (50) feet in height. Such facilities may be
approved by the Planning Commission as an accessory use to any commercial,
professional, office or institutional structure provided:
            1.   The Wireless Communication Facility is designed to be as
unobtrusive as possible, and; shall match or be compatible with, the structure
on which it is located; and;
            2.   The Wireless Communication Facility does not extend more than
twenty-five (25) feet above the highest point of the supporting structure, and;
            3.   The Wireless Communication Facility complies with all
applicable FCC and FAA regulations, and;
            4.   The Wireless Communication Facility complies with all
applicable building codes and any additional equipment or structure is fully
screened and located in accordance with the underlying zoning district
requirements.
            5.   Any Wireless Communication Facility and its appurtenances
located on the roof of a building are to be set back one (1) foot from the edge
of the roof of said building for each one (1) foot in height of the Wireless
Communications Facility. However this setback requirement shall not apply to
antennas less than two (2) inches in diameter, which are mounted to the sides
of any antenna, support structures and which do not protrude more than six (6)
inches from the side of such antenna support structure.
               a.   The setback mentioned in this subsection does not apply to
any Wireless Communication Facility that is located on an elevator penthouse of
said building, provided that such facility meets applicable FCC and FAA
requirements.

            3.   If the tower must be extended in the future to accommodate co-
location, the initial tower foundation must be designed to support this co-
location capacity, and the tower must be designed to accommodate this extension
capability.
            4.   The antenna tower setback defined in paragraph H. below must
be based on the ultimate co-location tower height planned. This ultimate height
must be specified on the drawings submitted. Tower height shall not be extended
until co-locators are installed.
            5.   Agreement to this provision must be included in the lease by
the landowner, if different from the owner/operator of the wireless tower or
antenna. Written documentation must be presented to the Planning Commission
evidencing that the landowner of the property on which the tower is to be

compliance with such revised standards and regulations within ninety (90) days
of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different

declare the facility abandoned (excluding any dormancy period between
construction and the initial use of the facility). The facility's owner/
operator will receive written notice from the City or its designee and be
instructed to either reactivate the facility's use within one hundred-eighty
(180) days, or dismantle or remove the facility. In the case of a multi-use

facility within one hundred-eighty (180) days of ceasing its use and return the
site to its pre-exiting condition.
   (b)   Notice Requirements. The City must provide the tower or antenna owner
or operator ninety (90) days notice and an opportunity to be heard before the
Planning Commission before the City can initiate removal of the facility. After
such notice the City shall have the authority to initiate proceedings either to

market value, or in the alternative, to order the demolition of said tower and
all appurtenances.
   (c)   Public Hearing. The City shall provide the tower owner with the right
to a public heating before the Planning Commission which public heating shall
follow the ninety (90) days notice required in subsection (b) hereof. All
interested parties shall be allowed an opportunity to be heard at the public
heating.

to subsection (c) hereof, the Planning Commission may order the acquisition or

issuance of a permit to post a cash or surety bond acceptable to the City
Engineer of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per vertical foot from
natural grade of the Wireless Communication Facility. Said bond shall warrant
that an abandoned, obsolete or destroyed Wireless Communication Facility will
be removed within one hundred-eighty (180) days of cessation of use and
abandonment. If the Wireless Communication Facility is not removed within one
hundred-eighty (180) days of cessation of use or abandonment, the owner or
operator shall forfeit this bond, but the obligation to remove the Wireless
Communication Facility and restore the site to its pre-existing condition shall
remain. In the event that said facility is not removed within one hundred-
eighty (180) days of cessation of operations at a site, the facilities may be
acquired or removed by the City and the costs of removal assessed against the
property or recovered by other legal means from the owner or operator. Any co-
locator shall be required to additionally execute such bond, as principal, to
insure that the bond will be in place during the period of time that the co-
locator occupies the tower.

their usage as they presently exist. Routine maintenance (including replacement
with a new tower of like construction and height serving the same purpose)
shall be permitted on such pre-existing towers. A replacement tower must be
constructed within one hundred-eighty (180) days following any removal of the
initial facility. New construction other than routine maintenance on a pre-
existing tower shall comply with the provisions of this Chapter.
   (c)   Rebuilding Damaged or Destroyed Nonconforming Towers or Antennas: Bona
fide nonconforming towers or antennas that are damaged or destroyed may be
rebuilt. The type, height, and location of the tower onsite shall be of the
same type as the original facility. If there are any changes contemplated in
the previous design the owner of any such facility must submit the said changes
to the Planning Commission for review and approval. Should the Planning
Commission fail to act on the owner's request within a period of sixty (60)
days the request will be deemed granted. Any permits to rebuild the facility
shall comply with the then applicable building codes and shall be obtained
within one hundred-eighty (180) days from the date the facility is damaged or
destroyed. If no permit is obtained or if said permit expires, the tower or
antenna shall be deemed abandoned as specified in this Chapter; provided that
such delay is not caused by force majeure as defined in this Chapter.
(Ord. 00-97. Passed 11-28-00.)

   (a)   Performance bonds or other surety such as a certified check or letter
of credit, may be required to assure the proper authorities that completion of
minimum improvements will be made and that the improvements are in conformance
with the standards established in these Regulations. The City Service-Safety
Director, shall secure approval as to the form, sufficiency and execution of
the surety from their appropriate legal counsel. The surety shall not be
released until the City Engineer has certified satisfactory completion of all
required minimum improvements and the dedication of land and facilities for
public use has been submitted to Council. Reduction of the surety may be made,
on a prorated basis, for portions that have received the engineer's

performance bonds or other sureties. The developer shall provide for the upkeep
and maintenance of all improvements, including snow removal. If there are
certificates of occupancy on any street, which dedication has not been
accepted, the City, may on twelve hours notice plow the street or effect
emergency repairs for any improvement and charge same to developer. The
maintenance surety shall be submitted for a period of at least one year after
the completion of the improvements and offer of dedication for public use is
made, and shall not be required longer than two years.
1105.30 VARIANCES.
   The following regulations shall govern the granting of variances:
   (a)   Where the City Planning Commission finds that extraordinary and
unnecessary hardship may result from strict compliance with these Regulations
due to exceptional topographic or other physical conditions, it may vary the
regulation so as to relieve such hardship, provided such relief may be granted
without detriment to the public interest and without impairing the intent and
purpose of these Regulations, or the desirable development of the neighborhood
and co unity. Such variations shall not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of this chapter, the master plan or the Zoning Code.
   (b)   In granting the variances or modifications, the City Planning
Commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure
substantially the objective of the standards of requirements so varied or
modified.

CHAPTER 1107
Subdivision Regulations-Design Standards
1107.01   Purpose.
1107.02   Conformity to development plans.
1107.03   Physical considerations.
1107.04   Street design.
1107.05   Block design.
1107.06   Lots.
1107.07   Easements.
1107.08   Installation of utilities.
1107.09   Flood areas.
1107.10   Storm water detention.
1107.11   Open spaces.
 
1107.01 PURPOSE.
   The regulations contained herein shall control the manner in which streets,
lots and other elements of a subdivision are arranged on the land. These design
controls will help insure convenient and safe streets, creation of usable lots,
provision of space for public utilities and reservation of land for
recreational uses. The planning of attractive and functional neighborhoods
shall be promoted, minimizing the undesirable features of unplanned, haphazard
growth.
 
1107.02 CONFORMITY TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS.
   The arrangement, character, width and location of all primary and secondary
streets or roads shall conform with the City's Major Thoroughfare Plan. Streets
or roads not contained in the aforementioned Plan shall conform to the
recommendation of the City Planning Commission based upon the design standards
set forth herein. In addition, no final plat of land within the area in which
an existing resolution or ordinance is in effect shall be approved unless it
conforms with such resolution or ordinance.
1107.03 PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
   (a)   Natural Land Use. Subdivisions should be planned to take advantage of
the topography of the land to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities, to reduce the amount of grading, and to minimize destruction of
trees and topsoil.
   (b)   Land Suitability. If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed
to be subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision development due to flooding,
inadequate drainage, soil and rock formations with severe limitations for
development, susceptibility to mud slides or earth slides, severe erosion
potential, unfavorable topography, inadequate harmful to the health, safety or
welfare of the future residents of the proposed subdivision or community; and
if from investigations conduced by the public agencies concerned, it is
determined that in the best interests of the public the land should not be
developed for the purposed of the proposed, the Planning Commission shall not
approve the land for subdivision unless adequate methods are advanced by the
subdivider for solving the problem that will be created by the development of
the land.
1107.04 STREET DESIGN.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets
shall conform to the Major Thoroughfare Plan of the City or subsequent
amendments thereof and shall be considered in their relation to existing and
planned streets, topographical conditions and public convenience and safety and
in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by
such streets. The subdivider shall provide within the boundaries of the
subdivision plat the necessary right of way for the widening, continuance or
alignment of such streets in conformity with the Major Thoroughfare Plan.
   (a)   General Street Standards.
      (l)   The arrangement, character, extent and location of all streets
conform to the adopted General Development Plan. The design of proposed streets
shall provide for both the continuation of existing streets and access to
adjacent unplatted lands so that the entire area can be served with a
coordinated street system.
      (2)   Existing or projected collector streets in adjoining areas shall be
continued in new subdivisions and local residential streets shall be continued
to prevent dead-end streets.
      (3)   No street arrangement shall be approved that prevents convenient
future access to adjoining undeveloped property.
      (4)   Local residential streets shall be designed so as not to offer
direct routes to through traffic.
      (5)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets,
reverse frontage with screen planting contained in nonaccess reservation along
the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys or other such
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties
and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
      (6)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right of way
or limited access highway right of way, the Planning Commission may require a
street parallel to and on each side of such right of way, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes
in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in
appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard
for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separation.
   (b)    Horizontal Alignment. The radius of curvature on the centerline of
streets shall not be less than the following:
 
Street Classification Minimum Radius of Curvature
Arterial              500 (feet)
Collector             300
Local                 150
When there is an angle of deflection of more than one degree between the
centerline tangent sections of a street, a curve of adequate radius shall
connect them. Between reverse curves, a minimum tangent of 100 feet shall be
introduced. Minimum horizontal visibility, measured on the centerline, shall
be:
 
Street Classification Minimum Horizontal Viability (feet)
Arterial              500
Collector             300
Local                 150
   (c)    Vertical Alignment. All changes of grade shall be connected by
vertical curves of a minimum length in feet equal to ten times the algebraic
difference in the rate of grade for arterials and industrial streets; for
collector and local streets, fifteen times. Minimum vertical visibility shall
conform to the Ohio Department of Transportation's regulations in effect on the
date of the approval of the preliminary plat.
   (d)   Right-of-way and Pavement Widths.  The street right- of-way widths and
traveled pavement width exclusive of curb and or curb and gutter shall not be
less than the following:
 
Street          Right-of-way Pavement Width (Feet)
Classification  Width (Feet)
                Low & Medium Density               High Density
                (R-1 & R-2)                        (R-3 & Non-
                                                   Residential)
Arterial Street 80*          48                    48
Collector       60*          36                    36
Local           60           26                    36
*Consider as minimum. To be adjusted upward in accordance with traffic needs.
Where there are unusual topographical or other physical conditions, the City
Planning Commission may require greater widths for rights-of-way and pavements
for local streets.
** “Low, Medium and High Density Residential" refers to R-1, R-2, and R-
3 Zoning Districts respectively as defined in the City's Zoning Ordinance.
"Non--Residential" refers to all other districts in the Zoning Ordinance.

special street types:
      (l)   Cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed 600 feet in length and shall
not be less than 160 feet in length measured from the right-of-way line at the
intersection to the center of the paved turn around. The closed end shall be a
paved turn around having a minimum radius of forty feet to the outer pavement
edge and a radius of fifty feet to the right-of-way line. the pavement shall
cover all the area within the outer pavement edge.
      (2)   Permanent dead-end streets shall not be permitted. Temporary dead-
end streets shall be permitted only as part of a continuing street plan and
only if a temporary turnaround satisfactory to the Commission in design,
maintenance and removal is provided. Dead-end streets longer than 200 feet
shall not be permitted.
      (3)   Dedication of new half-streets shall not be permitted. Where a
dedicated or platted half- street exists adjacent to the tract being
subdivided, the other half shall be platted.
      (4)   Where a subdivision adjoins an arterial street, a marginal access
street may be required to control access to the arterial from lots fronting on
it. Access is controlled in the interest of public safety and to maintain the
design capacity of the street system. Points of access to the arterial shall be
spaced at a minimum of 1,320 feet.
   A planting strip having a minimum width of twenty feet shall be provided
between the pavement of the arterial street and the pavement of the marginal
access street. The minimum width of the marginal access right of way shall be
thirty feet.
      (5)   Alleys shall not be approved in residential districts except where
justified by extreme conditions. Alleys may be required in commercial and

feet and a pavement width of twenty feet.
   (g)   Street Intersections. the following regulations shall govern the
design and layout of street intersections:
      (l)   Streets shall be designed to intersect at approximately ninety
degrees. Streets shall remain in the right angle of intersection for 100 feet
beyond the point of intersection.
      (2)   Where a proposed subdivision abuts or contains an existing or
proposed arterial street, the number of intersections with the arterial shall
be kept to a minimum and shall not be located less than 1,320 feet apart,
measured from center line to center line. Intersections of collector streets
with collector streets shall not be located less than 200 feet apart.
Intersections of any streets with arterial streets shall be located not less
than 1,320 feet apart.
      (3)   Multiple intersections involving junctions of more than two streets
shall be avoided.
      (4)   Four-way intersections of local streets should be avoided where

of- way radius shall be twenty- five feet.
   (h)   Streets for Commercial Subdivisions. Streets serving business
developments and accessory parking areas shall be planned to connect with
arterial streets so as not to generate traffic on local streets. The
intersections of driveways from parking areas with arterial or collector
streets shall be 1Qcated so as to cause the least possible interference with
traffic movement on the streets; shall be located not less than 100 feet from
the interaction of an arterial or collector street with any other street; and
shall be spaced not less than 200 feet from each other.
The Commission may require marginal access streets to provide maximum safety
and convenience.
   (i)   Streets for Industrial Subdivisions. Collector streets for industrial
subdivisions shall be planned to serve industrial areas exclusively and shall
connect with arterial streets so that no industrial traffic will be directed
onto any residential streets. The intersections of service streets from parking
areas with arterial or collector streets shall be not less than 100 feet from
the intersection of the arterial or collector streets and shall be not less
than 100 feet from the intersection of the arterial or collector street with
any other street. Streets shall be planned to be extended to the boundaries of
any adjoining land planned for industry except for severe physical conditions
or if the Commission finds such extension is not in accord with the approved
plan of the area.
1107.05  BLOCK DESIGN.
   (a)   Blocks. The following regulations shall govern the design and layout
of blocks:
      (l)   The arrangement of blocks shall be such as to conform to the street
planning criteria set forth above and shall be arranged to accommodate lots and
building sites of the size and character required for the district as set forth
in this chapter or in the Zoning Code and to provide for the required community
facilities.
      (2)   Irregularly shaped blocks, those intended for cur-de-sacs or loop
streets and those containing interior parks or playgrounds shall be approved by
the Commission when properly designed and located and when the maintenance of
interior public spaces is covered by agreements.
      (3)   No block shall be longer than 1,500 feet or less than 500 feet.
      (4)   Where blocks are over 900 feet in length, a crosswalk easement not
less than ten feet in width at or near the halfway point may be required, if
necessary, to provide proper access to schools, recreational areas, shopping
centers and other facilities.
1107.06  LOTS.

   (4)   Lots with double frontage shall be avoided except, where the
Commission determines that it is essential to provide separation of residential
development from arterial streets.
   (5)   No corner lot shall have a width at the building line of less than
seventy feet.
   (6)   Each lot shall abut on a public street and narrow reserve strips of
land which are intended by the owner of a plat to prevent access to streets or
the extension of sewer, water or storm drain lines from one plat to another are
prohibited. Buffer lots are permitted. See definitions.
   (7)   No lots shall be formed or building permitted at the closed end of a
temporary or stub-end street which would tend to prevent the appropriate
extension of such road or street into an adjoining territory.
1107.07 EASEMENTS.
   Easements at least twelve feet in width along the rear lot line and ten feet
in width centered along the side lot lines shall be provided where necessary
for sanitary sewers, gas mains, water mains, electric lines and storm sewer.

   (a)   General. City Council, consistent with the mission and findings of the
Downtown Bellefontaine Partnership, and being mindful of the proud history of
Bellefontaine and of the importance of the downtown’s character and
architectural heritage in the everyday lives of its citizens and in promoting
business and economic development hereby declares as a matter of public policy
that the preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, development and
redevelopment of the downtown are matters of public necessity involving the
health, safety and welfare of its residents and businesses.
   The purpose of this chapter, the Downtown Business Overlay District is to:
      (1)   Provide supplemental regulations or standards which are consistent
with the City’s intent to guide public and private actions within the Overlay
District in terms of redevelopment and re-use of existing land and structures,
new development, and the preservation of the area’s historic character and
architecturally significant structures. These supplemental regulations are in
addition to “base” or underlying zoning district regulations applicable in the
“B-2 Downtown Business District”. Whenever there is a conflict between the
regulations of the underlying district those of the overlay district, the
overlay district regulations will control;
      (2)   Provide a more flexible instrument, which governs development by
the urban design principles and guidelines of building placement, building form
and character, access and parking placement, and the availability of pedestrian
amenities to establish and support a pedestrian-friendly shopping and civic
center, contrary to conventional development control strictly by type of use;
      (3)   Maintain and enhance the distinctive character of the Overlay
District by safeguarding the architectural integrity of the various period
structures within it, and to prevent intrusions and alterations within the
Overlay District that would be incompatible with the established character; and
      (4)   Provide for a means of design review for those aspects of
redevelopment and new development within the Overlay District in order to
ensure compatibility with the District’s character, scale, building fabric, and
historic architectural elements, in an effort to achieve a more attractive and
viable business and civic environment for the City’s residents and visitors.
   (b)   Objectives. The Downtown Business Overlay District is specifically
designed to:
      (1)   Maintain, promote and ensure Bellefontaine’s downtown as its
historic business and civic center.
      (2)   Provide for increased opportunities and land use efficiency for
redevelopment, new development and business development expansion.
      (3)   Assist property owners to rehabilitate their property and receive
tax credits.
      (4)   Protect property and private investment.
      (5)   Encourage a viable and compatible mix of commercial, business,
office, and residential uses in the district.
      (6)   Discourage the use of property with small and isolated freestanding
structures oriented primarily to automobile traffic.
      (7)   Discourage the development of building additions and new
construction, which require large buildings, incompatible with the character
and scale of the district.
      (8)   Maintain a continuous building form, parallel to the street, and
without setbacks from the right-of-way.
      (9)   Prevent abrupt and severe differences and change in the character
of development.
      (10)   Enhance the distinguishable character and scale of Bellefontaine’s
City Center.
      (11)   Protect the historically significant and other contributing
structures and promote their longevity as viable resources for re-use and
redevelopment.
      (12)   Allow the application of performance standards to development and
redevelopment so as to mitigate any adverse impacts on adjacent areas and the
overall district.
      (13)   Promote public health, safety and welfare.

   In considering the appropriateness of an application for any change,
improvement and/or development in the Overlay District, the Design Review Board
shall take into account all the unique elements and circumstances of the
particular site and/or building, and their relationship with the surrounding
properties and the character of the Overlay District as a whole, and shall
utilize the Board to review the application and arrive at a preliminary and
final decision.
   (a)   Conditions for Review and Approval. The use of the property and the
proposed improvements in the Overlay District shall be in accordance with these

(Ord. 06-2. Passed 2-28-06.)
1112.11 DOWNTOWN DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   (a)   Introduction.
      (1)   A downtown is more than a collection of buildings and much more
than just another shopping center. It is the traditional center of a community;
a center defined more socially than architecturally or graphically. It is a
place where people doing a quick errand run into people they know and end up
spending several hours. It is a place for strolling and window shopping, and
watching people go by. It is a place where people live and work. It is a place
where merchants know customers by face, if not by name. It is a place where
parades, celebrations and sidewalk sales are held. It is a place where every
citizen of our town feels at home. In short it is a place for activities of all
kinds, for all people.
      (2)   The Downtown Bellefontaine Partnership (DBP) and the City of
Bellefontaine have adopted these design guidelines to provide property owners
with information and assistance on their buildings. These guidelines apply to
planning for new construction, rehabilitation and renovation of commercial and
residential facades in the defined downtown area. These guidelines will be a
tool as we work together to establish our downtown as the true center of
Bellefontaine. The DBP's goal is to work with property owners to develop a
downtown which has character and consistency from block to block. This, in
turn, will promote economic development and business expansion through new
mixed-use development and help make the downtown into a thriving civic and
retail center.
      (3)   The City of Bellefontaine currently enforces planning and zoning
ordinances. The downtown is zoned as a B-2 district and the ordinances regulate
building usage, height and frontage, in addition to lot area and setback
requirements. With the creation of the Design Review Board, there is now an
entity which regulates all exterior improvements in the downtown area to
protect the character of our historic downtown.
      (4)   The overall approach in sound preservation guidelines is to respect
the character of the historic downtown. This principle does not prevent changes
to a historic building or neighborhood but does require careful planning before
making repairs, alterations, undertaking demolition or designing a new
structure.
      (5)   The Downtown Bellefontaine District is an "overlay" district within
the Codified Ordinances of the City of Bellefontaine, Ohio. As an overlay, the
designated district must follow these design guidelines as well as the
regulations of B-2 classification. In any areas of conflict, the Downtown
Design Ordinance supersedes the City's B-2 Ordinance.
      (6)   Before any significant changes are made to a downtown property, the
owner must obtain approval from the Design Review Board. Once the applicant
receives approval from the DRB they must apply for a state building permit.

Downtown Bellefontaine District Map
   (b)   Application of Design Guidelines. Architectural design guidelines are
a very important part of maintaining the unique character of Downtown
Bellefontaine. The guidelines serve as a communication tool in educating
property owners and developers as to the community expectations for new
construction and renovations to existing buildings.
   These architectural guidelines also serve as a guide for the DRB in
reviewing applications prior to the issuance of a zoning permit by the City of
Bellefontaine. Given the architectural variety and multiple uses in our
downtown, the review of proposed alterations and new construction will be
conducted on a case-by-case basis.
   These architectural guidelines are not meant as a check-list for "good"
design. Nor are they meant to be applied in such a stringent manner as to
prevent creative design alternatives. However, it is the intent of these
architectural design guidelines to provide the regulatory authority to ensure
that new construction and renovation of existing structures is consistent with
the character-defining elements identified in these guidelines.
   (c)   Review Principles.
      (1)   These guidelines shall apply only to the exterior of buildings and
to portions of existing and proposed buildings that would be visible at the
pedestrian level including public rights-of-way and alleys.
      (2)   While economic costs are not a primary factor in the review
process, economic costs will be considered in relation to the adherence to
these guidelines.
      (3)   It is understood that a project might not meet every guideline in
order to conform to the document's intent.
      (4)   It is not the intent of these guidelines to require existing
buildings to be in full compliance with these guidelines. Existing buildings
that contain nonconforming elements are encouraged to make alterations that
will improve the overall appearance of the building. As non-conforming
buildings are altered, the proposed alterations shall be in compliance with
these design guidelines.
      (5)   The Design Review Board will use these guidelines to review
proposed projects in a consistent, fair and equitable manner. If the board
believes that a project does not meet the intent of the guidelines, the
applicant may appeal to the City of Bellefontaine, Board of Zoning Appeals.
         Use the guidelines when considering:
         A.   Renovations
         B.   Additions
         C.   Demolition
         D.   Any exterior changes to your building
         E.   New downtown building projects
         F.   Sidewalk improvements
         G.   Landscaping and historic improvements
         H.   Parking and service improvements
         I.   New storefronts or lighting
   (d)   Overview of General Design Guidelines.
      (1)   The overall goals behind Design Guidelines are to:
         A.   Reduce the visual incompatibility of future construction and
current buildings.
         B.   Provide for appropriate improvements, signage, amenities and
street tree planting in order to achieve a coherent downtown district.
         C.   Ensure that new additions or alterations shall not detract from
the overall architectural character of a property or its neighbors.
         D.   Strive to make the pedestrian environment more comfortable and
secure.
      (2)   The design guidelines to be applicable in the Bellefontaine
Downtown Business District are based on the "Standards for Rehabilitation and
Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings" as adopted by the Secretary
of the Interior, U.S. Department of Interior, National Parks Service. While the
"Secretary's Standards" offer a good starting point for considering
rehabilitation and new construction in historic areas, more detailed guidance
is necessary to facilitate well-designed modifications in downtown
Bellefontaine. The following guidelines pay close attention to the special
building elements and patterns which are present in downtown Bellefontaine.
These elements and patterns give our downtown its unique character.

   (e)   Design Guidelines.
      (1)   General.
         A.   If an element cannot be seen from the street or alley, DRB has no
jurisdiction.
         B.   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
      (2)   Building Materials. 
         A.   Power washing is allowed if less than 400psi pressure is used.
         B.   Mortar should be of a nature that duplicates the original used as
closely as possible in appearance, texture, hardness and joint width. The
original building material (whether located on primary, secondary or rear
facades), shall be retained when possible. If the original material has been
overlaid by such coverings as aluminum or stucco, these alterations should be
removed and the original material maintained, repaired or replaced with similar
materials.
         C.   New construction shall use traditional construction materials
appropriate to the downtown.
         D.   Storefront and upper levels should have materials that are
compatible.
      (3)   Storefronts.
         A.   Storefronts may be replaced when there is no historic integrity;
however, if historic integrity is present components may be replaced only if
irreparable.
         B.   Wood may be placed over glass panels on a storefront facade, only
if muntins are retained, and the wood is painted a compatible color.
         C.   Porches and steps that contribute to a building's historic
integrity should be retained, wherever possible. Likewise, it is not
recommended to enclose porches and steps in a manner that is contrary to their
intended appearance.
         D.   Storefronts shall be designed to reflect the traditional pattern
of containment of space. The storefront shall be bounded by the framing
storefront cornice and piers on the side and the sidewalk on the bottom.
         E.   Remodeled storefronts shall be designed to fit within the
original opening.
         F.   Storefronts should provide for a recessed entry.
         G.   Storefronts shall be pedestrian oriented and consist primarily of
transparent glass.
      (4)   Facade.
         A.   The height of the building must be in proportion to its width and
the story-to-story height of the building must be appropriate.
         B.   The height of new buildings and additions shall relate to the
surrounding contributing buildings; avoid new construction that greatly varies
in height from adjacent buildings.
         C.   Where possible maintain the existing skyline created by the
roofline and cornice elevation.
         D.   Corner buildings should be higher than those that are interior to
the block.
         E.   Corner buildings shall be a minimum of two stories in height.
         F.   In infill construction, the facade width should fill the entire
space.
         G.   Maintain the existing theme of facade and detail.
         H.   If the site is large, the mass of the facade should be broken
into smaller bays to maintain a theme similar to surrounding buildings.
         I.   Themes that carry throughout the block such as window spacing,
cornice height, etc., shall be incorporated in the new facade.
         J.   Storefront and display windows are encouraged in all buildings.
         K.   Building facades should have a sense of unity and balance.
         L.   Maintain the original qualities and character of the building,
structure or site. The removal or alteration of any historic material or
distinctive architectural feature shall be avoided.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3660_5595x7515.jpg]
         M.   Rehabilitation work should fit the character of the original
building.
         N.   All buildings, structures and sites shall reflect the time of its
construction. Alterations which have no historical basis shall be discouraged.
Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are part of the
history and development of a building, structure or site. These changes may
have acquired significance in their own right, and where appropriate, this
significance shall be recognized and respected.
         O.   Preserve significant ornamental elements whenever possible.
Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced
whenever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material
should match the material being replaced in composition, texture, design and
other visual qualities. The composition, type of joint, size of units,
placement and detailing should be appropriate for the building. Imitation or
synthetic materials such as aluminum or vinyl siding, imitation stone or
similar plastic materials are inappropriate. Some vinyl clad windows might be
considered by the review board.
         P.   The use of contemporary design in the alteration or addition to
existing structures is not discouraged when such changes do not destroy the
historical, architectural or cultural character of the property.
         Q.   Buildings located on corner sites are considered anchor buildings
and their building forms should reflect this designation. Anchor buildings are
typically larger in scale and massing and are often more ornate than infill
buildings.

         R.   Buildings located on a corner shall have a primary facade and a
secondary facade.
         S.   The main entrance of corner buildings shall be oriented toward
the primary street. Corner entrances are also encouraged.
         T.   For buildings that provide a separate upper-story entrance on the
exterior facade, the street level use entrance should be the primary focus of
the building facade while entrances for upper story uses shall be secondary.
         U.   Maintain the existing setbacks of adjoining properties.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3702_5565x5430.jpg]
      (5)   Awnings/canopies.
         A.   Storefronts are encouraged to have awnings or canopies to provide
pedestrians with sun/rain protection unless the structure is physically
unsuited. The overall form of the awning shall complement the character of the
building and reflect the shape of the window or door opening that it covers.
         B.   Back-lit awnings/canopies are discouraged. These awnings function
more as signs than a means of providing comfort and protection for the
pedestrian.
         C.   Awnings on the storefront level shall not extend into the second
story of the building facade.
         D.   Upper-floor awnings shall be mounted within the window opening.
         E.   Canopies shall be narrow in profile and shall not contain
residential design elements such as mansard roofs or shake shingles.
         F.   Awnings and canopies should not project more than 6 feet from the
lot line and must be suspended from the building.
         G.   Awnings should not cover architectural elements or span across
structural bays.
         H.   No awning or canopy may extend within two (2) feet of the curb
line.
         I.   All awnings and canopies shall be erected so that their lowest
point is at least eight feet above the sidewalk.
         J.   One double-faced nameplate may be suspended from an awning or
canopy perpendicular to the store front, provided the requirements of the sign
section are met.
         K.   Each applicant must complete a statement holding the City and DBP
harmless from any liability resulting from accident or injury caused by
erection and maintenance of such sign(s) and must provide throughout the time
that such sign(s) exist proof of insurance in the amount of one hundred
thousand dollars ($100,000.00).
         L.   Existing awning framework to remain is grandfathered.
         M.   New awnings are permissible only if of matte finish fabric
material, and are of compatible color. A sample of the fabric shall be
presented to the Design Review Board for approval. The Design Review Board
reserves the right to decline awning designs if deemed inappropriate.
         N.   Metal awnings may be replaced only if they contribute to the
historic integrity of the building. No new metal awnings will be approved.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3718_5100x9210.jpg]
      (6)   Signs.  
         A.   Before any downtown business/property owner erects, constructs,
reconstructs, replaces, or modifies any exterior sign on any building or
structure or paints a sign on the glass of a building in a Downtown
Bellefontaine District, an application must be filed with the City Engineer's
office. The application will be reviewed by the Design Review Board. The
application shall be accompanied by a full and accurate description of the
size, attachment method, materials, color, illumination and any other items
deemed necessary by the City Engineer or Design Review Board.
         B.   The Design Review Board shall make its decision within seven
working days after the application was first considered by the Board at a
regular or special meeting. Any rejection by the DRB shall describe the basis
for such finding and the person or entity aggrieved by the decision of such
Design Review Board may appeal the decision to the Board of Zoning Appeals
within ten days of such Design Review Board decision.
         C.   Signs shall be constructed of high quality materials and
craftsmanship. A sign must provide a finished appearance with historically
appropriate texture, moldings and/or edge finishings. Sign materials must
present an attractive and appropriate appearance that matches or exactly
replicates historical materials such as wood, tin, iron, gilts, three
dimensional letters and painted surfaces. The installation of a sign must be
reversible and shall not permanently alter or damage the historic building
materials and/or architectural detailing.
         D.   New signs, including replacements of existing signs, shall be
permitted as follows in the Downtown Bellefontaine District:
            1.   Wall signs: One principal wall sign shall be permitted on the
business establishment which it represents. One secondary wall sign is
permitted where a business has frontage on another street or where there is a
rear or side entrance commonly used by the public. Each sign may have a maximum
area of 25 square feet unless otherwise approved by the Design Review Board.
            2.   Directory signs: Each building may have one directory sign, in
addition to the above wall sign, that shall provide not more than two square
feet of area for each building occupant. Directory signs shall be mounted flat
against the face of the building like a wall sign.
            3.   Painted Window Signs: Professionally installed window signs
may have lettering and approved logos only.
            4.   Projecting signs: special exception. One projecting sign shall
be allowed for each business establishment occupying a building subject to the

               b.   Minimum vertical clearance to grade: eight (8) feet.
               c.   Maximum horizontal projection from face of building - four
(4) feet unless otherwise approved by the Board.
               d.   May not project above the roofline of the building to which
it is attached.
               e.   Each applicant must complete a statement holding the City
harmless from any liability resulting from accident or injury caused by
erection and maintenance of such sign(s) and must provide throughout the time
that such sign(s) exist proof of insurance in the amount of one hundred
thousand dollars ($100,000.00).
            5.   Temporary signs including banners, pennants, streamers and
balloons may be of any material but may not be used for longer than two weeks.
You are not required to obtain a permit for temporary signage but it is
understood that the City of Bellefontaine and the DBP will be held harmless
from all liability.
            6.   One Sandwich Board may be displayed on public sidewalks on the
property of the business in the Downtown Bellefontaine District, providing said
temporary sign conforms to the following criteria:
               a.   Maximum sign area dimension: three(3) feet wide and four
( 4) feet high for any free standing sign.
               b.   Sandwich boards must be placed to allow five feet of clear
width of unobstructed sidewalk.
            7.   Banners: Outdoor decorative banners attached to utility and/or
light poles promoting the City of Bellefontaine and/or its Downtown Business
District are not considered temporary signs. Such banners must be of a matte
finish fabric. Approval must be obtained from the City's Service Safety
Director and the owner of the pole(s) prior to installation and proceeds from
any sponsorship of said banners shall be a funding source toward the promotion,
improvement projects or any other projects deemed appropriate by the Downtown
Bellefontaine Partnership, Inc.
         E.   Prohibited Signs: Unless the design is based on a historic sign
of that building, the following signage shall not be considered appropriate:
               - internally illuminated signs
               - rooftop signs
               - off premises signs or graphics
               - billboards or minibillboards
               - back-lit plastic signs
               - flashing or animated signs
               - electronic message signs
               - vinyl banners (unless temporary signage)
         F.   All signs shall conform to the sign ordinance of the City of
Bellefontaine.
         G.   Existing signs of particular historic or architectural merit
should be preserved.
         H.   The primary focus of signs shall be oriented toward pedestrian
traffic and not vehicular traffic.
         I.   Signs identifying the name of the building, the date of
construction or other historical information should be composed of materials
similar to the building or of traditional plaque materials such as bronze or
brass. These building identification signs should be affixed flat against the
building and should not obscure architectural details elements.
         J.   Signs should be subordinate to the buildings facade. The size and
scale of the sign shall be in proportion to the size and scale of the street
level facade.
         K.   Storefront signs should not extend past the storefront cornice
line. Storefront signs are typicarly located in the transom area and shall not
extend past the storefront opening.
         L.   Signs shall reflect the overall symmetry of the building and
should not cover architectural detail.
         M.   Signs for multiple storefronts within the same building should
align with each other.
      (7)   Utility areas/rear entrances.
         A.   Utility areas and mechanical equipment should be designed so that
they do not detract from the aesthetic appeal of the district.
         B.   The screening of exterior trash and storage areas, service yards,
loading areas, transformers and air conditioning units is required. It is
recommended to use the same color and/or style as the primary building.
         C.   If the utility area is separate from the building it serves, it
is to be consistent with the City of Bellefontaine streetscape theme.
         D.   All roof equipment must be screened from public view if visible
from the street.
         E.   Rear entrances and entrances from parking areas are encouraged.
These entrances should provide sufficient architectural features to articulate
the building facade.
         F.   The rear entrance should be clean and well maintained. A small
sign, awnings, display windows and planter boxes can improve the appearance.
         G.   The rear entrance can be used by staff and customers alike.
      (8)   Color. 
         A.   Use historical paint colors appropriate to the downtown to ensure
compatibility.
         B.   The color of buildings should complement the adjacent buildings’
colors. The color of brick or other natural building materials should dictate
the color family choice. Bricks in the red and brown tones are encouraged.
Buildings should use primarily earth tones with historical colors used only as
minor accents. The accent colors should complement the primary color.
         C.   Colors must be appropriate to the style and period of the
building's construction.
         D.   Franchise or corporate structure, logo or sign colors will be
reviewed on a case by case basis for their appropriateness.
      (9)   Streetscape.
         A.   The streetscape should be uniform so that it acts to provide
continuity throughout downtown.
         B.   When making improvements to private property (including the
addition of benches, trash receptacles, fencing, lighting, bike racks, trash
enclosures or other accessories) owners should match approved Bellefontaine
styles for these elements.
         C.   When a redevelopment project disturbs existing streetscape
elements those items must be replaced with approved streetscape elements.
      (10)   Lighting.
         A.   Lighting in the downtown should serve to illuminate facades,
entrances and signage and provide an adequate level of personal safety while
enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the buildings.
         B.   Avoid colored lighting schemes in order to achieve continuity in
building lighting within the downtown.
         C.   Building and signage lighting must be indirect, with the light
source(s) hidden from direct pedestrian and motorist view. For exterior sign
illumination, shaded gooseneck lamps are encouraged.
      (11)   Doors and windows. The size and proportion of window and door
openings of the new construction or alteration should be similar to surrounding
buildings. Maintain original door and window openings. The size and location of
openings are an essential part of the overall design and an important element
in the building's architecture. Openings should not be altered. When windows
cannot be repaired, replacements should match the style and size of the
original window. Replacing the original windows with an entirely different type
of window can appear out of place given the type of window commonly found on
buildings of particular styles and time periods.
      (12)   Vacant lots. Lots that will remain vacant for more than 120 days
shall be planted with grass and be maintained to be free of weeds, trash and
vehicles.
      (13)   Non-conforming buildings.
         A.   The purpose of creating a historic district is to protect the
historic building stock and encourage maintenance, repair and restoration.
There are two general categories of non-conforming buildings.
            1.    Buildings that were built after 1940 and that are
incompatible with the district due to scale, materials and detailing.
            2.    Older buildings that have completely lost the integrity of
the original design due to substantial incompatible exterior alterations.
Buildings in this category not only have been stripped of architectural details
but have been completely modernized in their appearance.
         B.   Additions, alterations and rehabilitation of the above building
types should either be compatible with their own style and character or should
cause the building to become more compatible within the district. Non-
Conforming buildings are encouraged to adhere to the Design Guidelines for all
standards such as building materials, awnings, signs, color and lighting and
will undergo a special review to determine appropriateness by the Design Review
Board.

   (f)   Review of Building Applications and Plans.
      (1)   Application. Before any changes are made to a property in the
Bellefontaine Downtown District an application must be filed with the City
Engineers Office for review by the Design Review Board. The application must
contain the following information:
         A.   A color photograph of the present facade of each exterior wall of
the building which is proposed to be modified or of the existing landscaping,

   (g)   Conclusion. The designation of the Downtown Bellefontaine Design
Guidelines will
establish the area as a locally accepted asset, worthy of protection. The
preservation of existing historic buildings and settings and the promotion of
harmonious new construction should be the intended focus of this document.
Recognizing a historic amenity and protecting it should not be viewed as a
hindrance to new construction and creative architecture. Furthermore, the
protection of historic areas in other cities has proven to be a catalyst for
development and an important attraction that brings more people to the area for
business and shopping.
   "Compatibility" will be the primary guide for the Design Review Board when
that body reviews changes in the Downtown District. The objective of the Design
Review Board is to ensure the downtown’s future value as the physical
representation of Bellefontaine's heritage and not to eliminate progress.

Access Management Plan
1113.01    Purpose and intent.
1113.02    Road functional categories and characteristics.
1113.03    Point of access types.
1113.04    General requirements and regulations.
1113.01 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
    (a)   The City of Bellefontaine has adopted this Access Management Plan to
deal with problems associated with traffic congestion and safety caused by
construction of additional drives and/or intersecting streets along the road
network.
   (b)   This Access Management Plan is based on the following principles:
      (1)   To promote public safety and minimize traffic accidents.
      (2)   To provide necessary and safe access to property.
      (3)   To allow the public to make more efficient use of existing and
future roads.
   (c)   The City has adopted this Plan that considers modifications to
existing roadways to provide better access management and to establish access
management along all new roadways.
(Ord. 08-68. Passed 12-19-08.)
1113.02 ROAD FUNCTIONAL CATEGORIES AND CHARACTERISTICS.
    (a)   The roadways located in the City of Bellefontaine are classified
according to their Functional Classification. Functional Classification is the
grouping of roads, streets, and highways in a hierarchy based on the type of
highway service they provide. Streets and highways do not operate
independently. They are part of an interconnected network, and each one
performs a service in moving traffic throughout the system. Generally, streets
and highways perform two types of service. They provide either traffic mobility
or land access and can be ranked in terms of the proportion of service they
perform.
   (b)   The functional classification of the roadways in Bellefontaine is
based on the manual, Highway Functional Classification - Concepts, Criteria and
Procedures, published by the Federal Highway Administration in 1974 and revised
in 1989. The streets and roads in the City each have been assigned one of the
following classifications:
      (1)   Principal arterial. Functions:
         A.   Serve major activity centers, highest volume corridors, and
longest trip demands;
         B.   Carry high proportion of total urban travel on minimum of
mileage;
         C.   Interconnect and provide continuity for major rural corridors to
accommodate trips entering and leaving urban area and between the central
business district and outlying residential areas.
      (2)   Minor arterial. Functions:
         A.   Interconnect with and augment the principal arterials;
         B.   Serve trips of moderate length at a somewhat lower level of
travel mobility than principal arterials;
         C.   Distribute traffic to smaller geographic areas than those served
by principal arterials;
         D.   Provide more land access than principal arterials without
penetrating identifiable neighborhoods;
         E.   Provide urban connections for rural collectors.
      (3)   Collector. Functions:
         A.   Serve both land access and traffic circulation in residential,
and commercial/industrial areas;
         B.   Penetrate residential neighborhoods;
         C.   Distribute and channel trips between local streets and arterials.
      (4)   Local. Functions:
         A.   Provide direct access to adjacent land;
         B.   Provide access to higher systems;
         C.   Carry no through traffic movement.
            (Ord. 08-68. Passed 12-19-08.)
1113.03 POINT OF ACCESS TYPES.
   (a)   The following are the different classifications of streets and/or
drives regulated:
      (1)   Proposed public streets.
      (2)   Farm or field drives that provide access to tract of land used for
agricultural purposes.
      (3)   Single-family residential drives (SF-R).
      (4)   Multi-residential driveways that provide access to multiple single-
family residences or to multi-family dwelling units (MR-R).
      (5)   Commercial drives that provide access to office, business,
commercial or institutional building or buildings that services fewer than ten
trucks per day.
      (6)   Industrial/retail drives that serves a retail center or industrial
facility that services ten or more trucks per day.

1113.04 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATIONS.
      (a)   The number of driveways afforded any one site shall be minimized
(the need for more than one driveway may be required to be substantiated by a
Traffic Impact Study).
 
   (b)   It should be noted that these are desirable minimum distances. It is
recognized that site frontage and property limits may, by necessity, alter
these dimensions. At the same time, the City reserves the right to call for
greater spacing distances where feasible.
 
   (c)   Driveways shall be located in accordance with applicable sight
distance requirements (Stopping Sight Distance (SSD) and Intersection Sight
Distance (ISD) as contained in Section 200 of the ODOT Location and Design
Manual).

variance is appropriate and necessary and shall document the unique conditions
or special circumstances that make it impractical and infeasible to meet the
applicable standards and/or requirements of the Access Management Plan. The
documentation shall show that the applicant has considered all practical and
reasonable alternatives to mitigate the unique conditions or special
circumstances, that the alternatives are not feasible or practical, and that,
without the variance, the applicant will be deprived of reasonable access.
      (2)   In considering a request for a variance, the City shall determine
if:
         A.   The variance meets minimum applicable State, County, or City
standards including geometric design, operation, and safety elements - and if
the variance is shown to be beneficial to the traveling public.

use existing as of the date of passage of this Ordinance by another
nonconforming use, if no structural alterations, except those required by law
or resolution, are made; provided, however, in an R District no change shall be
authorized by the Board to any use which is not a permitted or conditional use
in any R District, and in a B District no change shall be authorized to any use
which is not a permitted or conditional use in any B District.
   (b)   Nonconforming Uses, Extension. The extension of a nonconforming
building upon the lot occupied by such building, or on an adjoining lot;
provided that such lot was under the same ownership as the lot in question at
the time the use of such building became a nonconforming use; provided that the
value of such extension shall not exceed in all twenty-five percent of the
assessed valuation for tax purposes of the existing building devoted to a
nonconforming use, and that such extension shall be within a distance of not
more than fifty feet of the existing building or premises. Such extension shall

result in violation of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance with respect to
any adjoining premises.
   (c)   Extension of Use on Border of District. The extension of a use or
building into a more restricted district immediately adjacent thereto, but not

operation and maintenance in connection with the proposed use of such devices
or such methods of operation as may, in the opinion of the Board, be reasonably
required to prevent or reduce fumes, gas, dust, smoke, odor, water-carried
waste, noise, vibration or similar objectionable features, and may impose such
conditions regarding the extent of open spaces between such industries or uses
and surrounding properties as will tend to prevent or reduce the harm which
might otherwise result from the proposed use of surrounding properties and
neighborhoods.
   (e)   Temporary Structures and Uses. The temporary use of a structure or
premises in any district for a purpose or use that does not conform to the

Ordinance, so as to relieve such hardship, and so that the spirit and purpose

not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property, and will not materially
impair the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance or the public interest.

unless the Board specifically finds that the condition or situation of the
specific piece of property, or the intended use of the property, for which

recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a
general regulation for such conditions or situation.

1155.03   Average dept of front yard.
1155.04   Computing rear and side yards.
1155.05   Side yard modifications.
 
1155.01  LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district where dwellings are permitted, a one- family detached
dwelling may be erected on any lot of official record at the effective date of
this Zoning Ordinance irrespective of its area or width, the owner of which
does not own any adjoining property, provided the applicable yard and other
open space requirements are complied with as nearly as possible.
1155.02  MINIMUM YARDS.
   In no case shall the width of any side yard be less than ten percent of
width of the lot. On a corner lot, the width of the side yard adjoining the
side street lot line shall not be less than eight feet or twenty percent of the
frontage, whichever is the greater.
   In no case shall the depth of the rear yard be less than ten feet.
1155.03 AVERAGE DEPTH OF FRONT YARDS.
In any residential or business district, where twenty- five percent or more of
the street frontage between intersecting streets is occupied by a building plus
required minimum side yards, the front yard requirements for the frontage shall
be the average yard determined by all existing buildings if such yard
dimensions are less than required by this Zoning Ordinance.
   In no case, however, shall such yard requirements plus the distance to the
center line of the fronting street be less than thirty feet in a business
district or twenty-five feet in a residential district, unless determined
otherwise by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (a)    Steep Slopes; Front Yard Garage. In any R District where the natural
grade of lot within the required front yard has an average slope, normal to the
front line at every point along such line, of such a degree of slope that is
not practicable to provide a driveway with a grade of twelve percent or less to
a private garage conforming to the requirements of this Ordinance, such garage
may be located within such front yard, but not in any case closer than six feet
to the street line
   (b)    Double Frontage Lots. Buildings on lots having frontage on two
nonintersecting streets need not have a rear yard if an equivalent open space
is provided on the lot in lieu of such required rear yard; applicable front
yards must be provided, however, on both streets.
1155.04 COMPUTING REAR AND SIDE YARDS.
   In computing the depth of a rear yard or the width of a side yard, where the
rear or side yard abuts an alley, one-half of the width of the alley may be
included as a portion of the required rear or side yard, as the case may be.
1155.05  SIDE YARD MODIFICATIONS.
   (a)    Increases. Each side yard, where required, shall be increased in
width by two inches for each foot by which the length of the side wall of the
building, adjacent to the side yard, exceeds forty feet.
   (b)    Varied; Wall Not Parallel. Side yard width may be varied where the
side wall of a building is not parallel with the side lot line or is broken or
otherwise irregular. In such case the average width of the side yard shall not
be less than otherwise required least width; provided however, that such side
yard shall not be narrower at any point than one-half the otherwise required
least width, or narrower than three feet in any case.
   (c)    One Side Yard Reduced. Width of one side yard may be reduced when
authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals, in the case of a one-family or two-
family dwelling, to a width not less than three feet; provided the sum of the
widths of the two side yards is not less than the required minimum, and
provided the distance between the proposed dwelling and another dwelling,
existing or proposed, on an adjacent lot is not less than the required minimum
sum of the widths of two side yards. Such reductions may be authorized only
when the Board finds it to be warranted by the location of existing buildings
or conductive to the desirable development of two or more lots.
   (d)   Corner Lots. A side yard along the side street lot line of a corner
lot, which lot abuts in the rear, either directly or across an alley, the side
lot line of another lot in an R District, shall have a width of not less than
one-half the required depth of the front yard on such other lot fronting the
side street.

1166.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter, to promote the health, safety and welfare
of the community by establishing regulations governing the siting,
construction, and maintenance of Solar Energy Systems. (Ord. 25-26. Passed 5-
27-25.)
1166.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of this chapter, "Solar Energy Systems" shall include the
following:
   (a)    Accessory Solar Energy: A solar collection system consisting of one
or more roof/building mounted, ground/pole mounted, and/or other structure
mounted solar collector devices and solar related equipment, and is intended to
primarily reduce on-site consumption of utility power. A system is considered
an accessory solar energy system only if it supplies electrical or thermal
power solely for on-site use, except that when a property upon which the system
is installed also receives electrical power supplied by a utility company,
excess electrical power generated and not presently needed for on-site use may
be used by the utility company.
   (b)   Principal Solar Energy Production Facility: An area of land or other
area used for a solar collection system principally used to capture solar
energy and convert it to electrical energy. These production facilities
primarily produce electricity to be used off-site. Principal solar energy
production facilities consist of one or more roof/building mounted, ground/pole
mounted, and/or other structure mounted solar collector devices, solar related
equipment, and other accessory structures and buildings including light
reflectors, concentrators, and heat exchangers, substations, electrical
infrastructure, transmission lines and other appurtenant structures and
facilities. Examples include "Small Solar Facility" and "Community Solar
Facility" as defined by statute or herein.
   (c)   Solar Energy Equipment: Items for the purpose of generation,
transmission, and storage of electricity, including but not limited to a solar
photovoltaic cell, solar panels, lines, pumps, inverter(s), batteries, mounting
brackets, racking, framing and/or foundation used for or intended to be used
for the collection of solar energy.
   (d)   Solar Photovoltaic (PV): The technology that uses a semiconductor to
convert light directly into electricity.
   (e)   Clear Fall Zone (Solar Energy): An area surrounding a ground/pole
mounted or other structure mounted solar energy system into which the system
and/or components might fall due to inclement weather, poor maintenance, faulty
construction methods, or any other condition causing the structure's failure
that shall remain unobstructed and confined within the property lines of the
lot where the system is located. The purpose of the zone being that if the
system should fall or otherwise become damaged, the falling structure will be
confined to the lot and will not intrude onto a neighboring property.
   (f)   Small Solar Facility: Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 713.081(A)(2), "Small
Solar Facility" means solar panels and associated facilities with a single
interconnection to the electrical grid and designed for, or capable of,
operation at an aggregate capacity of less than 50 MW.
   (g)   Community Solar: Also known as shared solar, or solar gardens, is an
energy model that allows customers to buy or lease part of a larger off-site
shared solar photovoltaic (PV) system. For the purposes of this Resolution,
"Community Solar" is considered to be a "Principal Solar Energy Production
Facility".
      (Ord. 25-26. Passed 5-27-25.)
1166.03 ACCESSORY SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS.
   (a)   Accessory solar energy systems are installed to reduce the on-site
consumption of utility-supplied electricity.
   (b)   An accessory solar energy system shall be considered a permitted
accessory use in any district provided all requirements and regulations as set
forth below are met.
   (c)    No person shall cause, allow or maintain the use of an accessory
solar energy system without first having obtained a zoning permit from the City
Engineer.
   (d)    All accessory solar energy systems shall meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   An accessory solar energy system is permitted in all zoning
districts as an accessory to a principal use.
      (2)   An accessory solar energy system shall not be used for the
generation of power for the sale or donation of energy to other users, although
this provision shall not be interpreted to prohibit the sale or donation of
excess power generated from time to time to the local utility company or the
sale of donation of power as part of a net metering or similar arrangement. Net
metering or similar arrangements are those where electricity produced by the
accessory solar energy system displaces electricity that would otherwise be
purchased from an electric utility or supplier for the lot where the accessory
system is located. Net metering or similar arrangements shall be incidental and
secondary to the production for on-site use.
      (3)   Accessory solar energy systems with a generation output of five
hundred (500) watts or less, or a combination of accessory solar energy systems
with an aggregate generation output of five hundred (500) watts or less, shall
not require a permit and shall be exempt from the requirements ofthis section,
provided that the system is independent and disconnected from the electrical
service(s) supplied to the lot on which the accessory solar energy system is
located.
      (4)   Roof/Building mounted accessory solar energy systems:
         A.   Shall not extend beyond the perimeter (or edge of roof) of the
building on which it is located.
         B.   May be mounted to a principal or accessory building.
         C.   The height ofthe solar energy system and building to which it is
mounted may not exceed the ridgeline of the roof for hip, gable, and gambrel
roofs.

         A.   Shall be no taller than seventy-five percent (75%) of the maximum
building height allowed in that zoning district for accessory buildings.
         B.   Shall be permitted in the rear or side yard only.
         C.   Shall be erected within an established clear fall zone.
         D.   The minimum setback distance fromthe property lines for
structures comprising the solar energy systems and all related equipment shall
be at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the height of any structure or at
least twenty (20) feet from the nearest property line, whichever is greater.
      (6)   Other structure mounted accessory solar energy systems:
         A.   Shall be no taller than seventy-five percent (75%) of the maximum
building height allowed in that zoning district for accessory buildings.
         B.   Shall be permitted in the rear or side yard only.
         C.   Shall be erected within an established clear fall zone.
         D.   The minimum setback distance from the property lines for
structures comprising solar energy systems and all related equipment shall be
at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the height of any structure or at
least twenty (20) feet from the nearest property line, whichever is greater.
      (7)   Accessory solar energy systems shall be designed and located in
order to prevent reflective glare toward any inhabited structure on adjacent
properties as well as adjacent street right of ways.
      (8)   Accessory solar energy systems and all solar energy equipment that
are no longer functioning shall be completely removed from the property within
six (6) months from the date they are no longer producing electricity, become
damaged, discontinued or broken. Any earth disturbance as a result ofthe the
removal of the accessory solar energy system shall be graded and reseeded
within thirty (30) days of removal.
      (9)   In addition to the site plan required for any zoning permit or
conditional use permit, the following shall also be submitted at the time of
application and shall include:
         A.   Height of the proposed solar energy system(s) at maximum tilt.
         B.   Evidence of established setbacks of 1.1. times the height of any
ground/pole mounted or other structure mounted solar energy systems and "clear
fall zone".
         C.   Proof of notice to the electric utility company regarding the
proposal. (Ord. 25-26. Passed 5-27-25.)
1166.04 PRINCIPAL SOLAR ENERGY PRODUCTION FACILITIES.
   (a)    Principal solar energy production facilities are principally designed
to produce greater levels of electrical energy, either for consumers with
higher energy demand levels or designed primarily to produce energy to be
supplied directly to the electrical grid.
   (b)    Principal solar energy production facilities shall only be located in
an M-2 General Manufacturing District after approval by the Board of Zoning
Appeals as a conditional use. The City Engineer shall issue the final zoning
permit. No zoning permit and/or conditional use permit shall become final until
all of the requirements set forth in this Chapter

Compatible residential, commercial, industrial, public and quasipublic uses may
be combined, provided that the proposed location of the commercial or
industrial uses will not adversely affect or disregard adjacent property,

a residential- commercial-industrial, residential-commercial, or commercial-
industrial development the amount of land devoted to commercial and/or
industrial usage shall not exceed fifty percent of the total land area of the

   The gross area of the tract to be developed under the planned unit
development approach shall comprise not less than ten acres. The minimum lot
size shall be not less than seventy percent of the lot area per family or use

developed under the planned unit development may be reduced fifty percent where
the proposed development is to contain only residential, commercial or
industrial development, not a mixture of uses.

parks, recreation and related uses. All land dedicated to the City must meet
the City Planning Commission's requirements as to shape, size and location.

   (c)    The lot widths may be reduced by not more than twenty percent of the
requirement of the Subdivision Regulations or this Zoning Code. The lots width
may be varied due to the variety of structural designs, and it is recommended
that setbacks be varied. If lot widths for residential lots are varied by the
subdivider, he shall enter into an agreement with the City that the property
owners within a planned unit development of this nature shall be assessed
equally for any improvement which may be by assessment rather than on a front
footage basis.
1199.06 COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
   The following regulations apply to planned commercial developments:
   (a)    Planned unit development of related commercial establishments is
encouraged by varying the setback and requirements. Open space gained through

thoroughfares. In planning these groups of buildings or establishments, no yard
space shall be required between uses within the groups; however, appropriate
yard space must be provided at the edge of the complete development. A side
yard of thirty feet and a rear yard of forty feet shall be required if the
project is to be located adjacent to any residential district or planned

contain the same information as required of notices published in newspapers as
specified in subsection (d) hereof.
   (f)    Approval in Principle by Planning Commission. Within forty days after
the public hearing required by subsection (c) hereof, the Planning Commission
shall take action to determine if the preliminary development plan is
consistent with the intent and purpose of the section; whether the proposed
development advances the general welfare of the City and neighborhood; and
whether the benefits, combination of various land uses and the
interrelationship with the land uses in the surrounding area justify the
deviation from standard district regulations. The Commission's approval in
principle of the preliminary development plan shall be necessary before an
applicant may submit a final development plan. Approval in principle shall not
be construed to endorse a precise location of uses, configuration of parcels,
or engineering feasibility.
   (g)    Final Development Plan. After approval in principle of the
preliminary development plan, the developer shall submit a final development
plan to the Planning Commission. The final development plan shall be in general
conformance with the preliminary development plan which was approved in
principle. Eight copies of the final development plan shall be submitted.
   (h)    Contents of Application for Approval of Final Development Plan. An
application for approval of the final development plan shall be filed with the
Clerk of the Planning Commission at least fourteen days and not more than
thirty days prior to the next meeting of the Commission by at least one owner
or lessee of the property for which the planned unit development is proposed.
Each application shall be signed by the owner or lessee, attesting to the truth
and exactness of all information supplied on the application for final
development plan. Each application shall clearly state that the approval shall
expire and may be revoked if construction on the project has not begun within
two years from the date of issuance of the approval. At a minimum, the
application shall contain or be accompanied by the following information:
      (1)    All plat contents and supplementary information for Final Plats as
required in the City's Subdivision Regulations, as amended.
      (2)    Tabulation of the number of acres in the proposed project for
various uses, the number of housing units proposed by type; estimated
residential population by type of housing; open space, parking areas, and
public improvements proposed for each unit of the development.
      (3)    Set of drawings and specifications of improvements of construction
and utility plans.
   (i)    Recommendation by Planning Commission. Within forty days after
receipt of the final development plan, the Planning Commission shall recommend
to Council that the final development plan be approved as presented, approved
with supplementary conditions or disapproved. The Planning Commission shall
then transmit all paper constituting the record and the recommendations to
Council.
   (j)    Criteria for Recommendation by Planning Commission. Before making its
recommendation as required in subsection (1) hereof, the Planning Commission
shall find that the facts submitted with the application and presented at the
public hearing establish that:
      (1)    The proposed development can be initiated within two years of the
date of approval;
      (2)   Each individual unit of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance
will be provided that such objective will be attained; the uses proposed will
not be detrimental to present and potential surroundings, but will have a
beneficial effect which could not be achieved under standard district
regulation.
      (3)    The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate
to carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic
in such amounts as to overload the street network outside the planned unit
development.
      (4)    Any propose* commercial development can be justified at the
locations proposed.
      (5)    Any exception from standard district requirements is warranted by
the design and other amenities incorporated in the final development plan.
      (6)    The area surrounding the development can be planned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development.
      (7)    The existing and proposed utility services are adequate for the
population densities and non- residential uses proposed.
   (k)    Action by Council.
      (1)    Within twenty days after receipt of the recommendation of the
Planning Commission, Council shall initiate action by ordinance to either
approve, approve with supplementary conditions or modifications or disapprove
the application as presented. If the application is either approved or approved
with conditions or modifications, Council shall direct the Zoning Inspector to
issue zoning permits only in accordance with the approved final development
plan and the supplementary conditions or modifications attached thereto; and
the final subdivision plat.
      (2)    Upon approval of a final development plan, the Official Zoning Map
shall be annotated for the land area involved so that the district name
includes the notation, "PUD."
   (l)   Supplementary Conditions and Safeguards. In approving any planned unit
development, the Council may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in
conformity with this Zoning Ordinance. Violation of such conditions or
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the final development
plan is approved, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Ordinance and
punishable under the penalty section of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (m)    Expiration and Extension of Approval Period.
      (1)    The approval of a final development plan for a planned unit
development shall be for a period not to exceed five years to allow for
preparation and recording of the required subdivision plat and the development
of the project. If no construction has begun within two years after approval is
granted, the approved final development plan shall be void and the land shall
revert to the district regulations in which it is located. An extension of the
time limit or modification of the approved final development plan my be
approved if the Planning Commission finds that such extension or modification
is not in conflict with the public interest.
      (2)    No zoning amendment passed during the time period granted for the
approved final development plan shall in any way affect the terms under which
approval of the planned unit development was granted.
   (n)    Provisions Governing Planned Unit Developments. Because of the
special characteristics of planned unit developments, special provisions
governing the development of land for this purpose are required. Whenever there
is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this chapter and those of
the other chapters of this Zoning Ordinance, the provision of this chapter
shall prevail. subjects not covered by this chapter shall be governed by the
respective provisions found elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance.
1199.09 MODIFICATIONS, ADJUSTMENTS AND REARRANGEMENTS OF PLAN AFTER FINAL
APPROVAL.
   (a)    Minor changes in the location, siting or character of buildings and
structures may be authorized by the Planning Commission if required by
engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time the final
development plan was approved.
   (b)    No change authorized by this section may increase the size of any
building or structure by more than ten percent, or change the location of any
building or structure by more than ten feet in any direction. However,
notwithstanding the foregoing, changes beyond the maximum or minimum
requirements set forth in this Zoning Code or in the Subdivision Regulations
shall not be permitted.
   (c)    All other changes in the planned unit including changes in the site
plan and in the development schedule, must be made under the procedure that are
applicable to the initial approval of a planned unit.

1313.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens. Therefore, the Council of the City of Bellefontaine, State of Ohio,
does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Bellefontaine has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Bellefontaine as identified in Section
1313.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
the City of Bellefontaine.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for
Logan County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both effective November 30, 2023.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Bellefontaine as required by Section
1313.04 (c) Subdivisions and Other New Developments. Any revisions to the
aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by reference and declared
to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or studies are on file at the
Bellefontaine City Engineer, 135 North Detroit Street, Bellefontaine, Ohio
43311.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (h)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
         Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state
or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over these
regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Bellefontaine, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof,
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 23-59.
Passed 10-10-23.)
1313.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.

   (p)   Floodproofing.
      Any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or
adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate
or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their
contents.
   (q)   Flood Protection Elevation.
      The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE, is the base flood elevation plus
one [1] foot of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (r)   Floodway.
      A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized
by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (s)   Freeboard.
      A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the
purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height
calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the hydro logic
effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (t)   Historic structure.  
      Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Bellefontaine s historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (u)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.
      An analysis performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State
of Ohio, in accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (v)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
      A Letter of Map Change is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
         Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
   A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
         Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
         A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade
changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and
floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a
LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been
elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded
from the special flood hazard area.
         Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
         A comment by FEMA regarding a proposed project that would, upon
construction, affect the hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding
source and thus result in the modification of the existing regulatory floodway,
the effective base flood elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR
does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (w)   Lowest floor.
      The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a
structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the lowest floor" which
is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a basement area,
provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the applicable design
requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures below the lowest
floor.
   (x)   Manufactured home.
      A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a
permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent
foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured
home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes of these
regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and mobile homes
as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (y)   Manufactured home park.
      As specified in the Ohio Adm. Code 4781-12-01(K), a manufactured home
park means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used
for habitation are parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and
includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or
intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land that is
subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale
or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is
not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are
parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority. Manufactured home park does not include any tract of land used
solely for the storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.
   (z)   Mean sea level.
      For purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood
elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
   (aa)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).
      The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating
communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and
their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an
agreement between local communities and the Federal government that states if a
community will adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce
future flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the
Federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as
a financial protection against flood loss.
   (bb)   New construction.
      Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after
the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by the City of
Bellefontaine and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
      For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
"start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial
FIRM [July 16, 1984] and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (cc)   Person.
      Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation,
partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and local
governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C. §111.15
(A)(2) as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. "Agency" does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (dd)   Recreational vehicle.
      A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or
less when measured at the largest horizontal projection, (3) designed to be
self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck, and (4) designed
primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters
for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Architect.
      A person registered to engage in the practice of architecture pursuant to

(hh)   Special Flood Hazard Area.
      Also known as "Areas of Special Flood Hazard", it is the land in the
floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given
year. Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood
Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH,
AO, Al-30, or A99. Special flood hazard areas may also refer to areas that are
flood prone and designated from other federal state or local sources of data
including but not limited to historical flood information reflecting high water
marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a
watercourse.
   (ii)   Start of construction.
      The date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or
other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start
means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of a building.
   (jj)    Structure.
      A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally above ground.
   (kk)   Substantial Damage.
      Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to the 'before damaged' condition would equal or exceed
fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   (ll)   Substantial Improvement.
      Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (mm)   Variance.
      A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations.
   (nn)   Violation.
      The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant
with these regulations.

      A.   Each federal agency has a responsibility to evaluate the potential
effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain to ensure that its planning
programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards and
floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies
and requirements of EO 11988.
   (k)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the City of Bellefontaine's flood maps, studies and other data
identified in Section
1313.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six (6) months of the date
such information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;

applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1313.03 (k)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Bellefontaine, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Bellefontaine have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area in order that the City
of Bellefontaine's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Bellefontaine boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of
the City of Bellefontaine suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new
corporate limits or the new area for which the City of Bellefontaine has
assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation. The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1313.05 , Appeals and Variances.
      (4)   Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
   (m)   Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data.
      (1)   Zone A:
         A.   Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         B.   When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final flood
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)   Zones AE, A1-30, AR and AO:
         A.   BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However:
            1.   Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
            2.   Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
         B.   If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1313.04 (i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
      (2)   Zones B, C, and X:
         A.   Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are
not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM
which are being revised to Zone AE, Al-30, AR or AO. Communities are encouraged
to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure that the health,
safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
   (n)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Require owners of substantially damaged structures to obtain a
floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the City of Bellefontaine and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Section
1313.04 (i)(1)B. items 1. and 3. to 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the "bankfull
stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General, Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
City of Bellefontaine specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1313.03 (k)(1)A. 3., when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
            (Ord. 23-59. Passed 10-10-23.)
1313.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The Council of the City of Bellefontaine, Ohio, shall utilize the
City of Bellefontaine, Ohio Board of Zoning Appeals as established by code
Section 1125 to hear all appeals and variances sought in carrying out this
chapter.
      (2)   Records of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be kept and filed in
the office of the City Engineer, 135 North Detroit Street, Bellefontaine, Ohio
43311.
 
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1313.05 (d) of these regulations.
 
   (c)   Appeals. Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within [10] days of the date of such notice and order, or
other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for
the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board
shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties
in interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is
submitted.
   (d)   Variances. Any person believing that the use and development standards
of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by Logan County.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         L.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            l.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
            Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1313.05 (d)(3)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
 
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Logan County Court of Common Pleas,
pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Chapter 2506. (Ord. 23-59. Passed 10-10-23.)
1313.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required.
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1313.03 (i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Section
1313.06 (c).
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1313.06 (c).

and order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;

      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;

or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a fourth degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the City of Bellefontaine. Each day such violation
continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained
shall prevent the City of Bellefontaine from taking such other lawful action as
is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. The City of Bellefontaine

   1320.01 PURPOSE.
   Structures which are left vacant for extended periods of time have been
shown to breed crime, pose public safety risks, and reduce property values and
the economic viability of the community in which they are found. The purpose of
this chapter is to establish a program for identifying and registering vacant
buildings; to determine the responsibilities of owners of vacant buildings and
structures; and to provide incentives for the rehabilitation and productive use
of vacant buildings. Shifting the cost or burden of the existence of vacant
structures from the general citizenry to the owners of the buildings is an
intended result of this chapter.
(Ord. 15-82. Passed 12-8-15.)

other than those used in the design of the building.
   (b)   "Unoccupied." A building which is not being used for occupancy
authorized by the owner. The term "unoccupied" shall only be applicable to
multi-unit structures when more than half (1/2) of the units and more than half
(1/2) of the available space are not currently occupied by a tenant or tenants.
   (c)   "Unsecured." A building or portion of a building which is open to
entry by unauthorized persons without the use of tools or ladders.

official; or
      (8)   Unoccupied with a mortgage status of abandonment (i.e. deceased or
foreclosed); or
      (9)   Unoccupied and abandoned by the property owner.
   (e)   "Evidence of vacancy." Any condition that on its own or combined with
other conditions present would lead a reasonable person to believe the property
is vacant. Such conditions include, but are not limited to: significantly below
standard utility usage, overgrown and/or dead vegetation, accumulation of
newspapers, circulars, flyers and/or mail, accumulation of trash, junk, and/or
debris, broken or boarded up windows, abandoned vehicles, auto parts or

   1320.03 VACANT BUILDING REGISTRATION.
   (a)   In all areas within the corporate limits of the City of Bellefontaine,
an owner of a structure which meets the definition of a "vacant building" as
set forth in this Chapter shall register such structure with the Office of the
Service-Safety Director or his duly designated representative not later than 90

is for sale, etc.); or
      (3)   If the building is to be returned to appropriate occupancy or use,
rehabilitation plans for the building and grounds. The rehabilitation plan
shall not exceed 12 months from the time they obtain permits, unless the

submitted by the previous owner until any proposed changes are submitted and
meet the approval of the Director.
   (f)   Failure of the owner or any subsequent owners to maintain the building

   (h)   The registration and all associated processes must be completed in its
entirety annually for as long the property remains vacant.
   (i)   The Service-Safety Director or his duly designated representative
shall maintain a record of any property-specific written statements from
community organizations, other interested parties, or citizens regarding the
history, problems, status, or blighting influence of a vacant building. Such
written statements shall become part of the permanent record pertaining to such
property. (Ord. 15-82. Passed 12-8-15.)
   1320.04  INSPECTIONS
   The Service-Safety Director or his duly designated representative reserves
the right to inspect any premises in the City for the purpose of enforcing and
assuring compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Upon the request of
the Service-Safety Director or his duly designated representative, an owner
shall provide access to all interior and exterior portions of a vacant building
in order to permit a complete inspection of the premises. A refusal to permit
access shall subject the owner to a civil penalty of $150 for each day the
refusal continues. Civil penalties under this Section which remain unpaid for
more than 10 days may be collected in an action at law by any method permitted
for collection of an unpaid account. Nothing in this Section shall limit the
right of the Service-Safety Director or his duly designated representative to
seek a search warrant for the vacant building from a court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (a)   Vacant buildings will be subject to an exterior inspection at least
twice per year at the Code Enforcement Officer's discretion to ensure the
compliance with property maintenance codes;

inspection at the start of each registration period (new and renewal) and when
a registration under this Chapter is terminated by the property owner;
   (c)   Vacant buildings will be subject to both an interior and an exterior
inspection upon acquisition of the property by a new owner.
   (d)   Any inspection that is to take place within 30 days of a previous
inspection may or may not be conducted at the discretion of the Service-Safety
Director or his duly designated representative.
      (Ord. 15-82. Passed 12-8-15.)
   1320.05  FEES.
   The fees described in this Section are established in order to defray the
cost to the City government and community as a whole related to the health,
safety and economic impacts of structures which remain vacant for long periods
of time, including but not limited to administrative costs for registering and
processing the vacant building owner registration form and for the costs
incurred by the City in monitoring the vacant building site. The fees are also
structured in order to provide appropriate incentives for owners of vacant
buildings to care for them properly, seek to fill them, and in appropriate
cases demolish them. The annually increased fee amounts are intended to absorb
the costs incurred by the City for demolition and hazard abatement of or
repairs to vacant buildings, as well as the continued normal administrative
costs stated above.
   (a)   The owner of a vacant building shall pay a fee of two hundred dollars
($200.00) for the first year the building remains vacant. For every consecutive
year that the building remains vacant, an annual fee will be assessed at double
the previous year's fee amount for a maximum annual fee equaling the five-year
fee of three thousand two hundred dollars ($3,200) to be used for the fifth and
for all consecutive, subsequent years of vacancy.
   (b)   The first annual fee shall be paid at the time the building is
registered. If the owner successfully restores the building to occupancy or
demolishes it in accordance with applicable law during the first year following
registration, the fee shall be refunded, less an administrative charge equal to
5% of the amount refunded. In each subsequent year, if the registration is
renewed in timely fashion, there have been no violations associated with the
property in the previous year, and re-inspection reveals no significant
housing, building or fire code violations, one-half of the previous year's
registration fee shall be refunded to the owner, less an administrative charge
equal to 5% of the amount refunded.
   (c)   The fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any building
permits unless the property is granted an exemption.
   (d)   All delinquent fees shall be paid by the owner prior to any transfer
of an ownership interest in the vacant building. A lien may be placed on the
property to collect delinquent fees.
   (e)   Absent a showing of good cause, if a building is not registered within
the time frame required in Section
1320.03, or the registration is not renewed within 30 days after the expiration
of one year from the date of the previous registration, a penalty shall be paid
in addition to the annual registration fee. The penalty shall be equal to one-
half of the current annual fee or one thousand dollars ($1,000), whichever is
less. (Ord. 15-82. Passed 12-8-15.)
   1320.06 EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   A building under active construction, reconstruction or renovation and
having a valid building permit(s) at the time of initial inspection shall be
exempt from registration until the expiration of the longest running, currently
active building permit.
   (b)   A building which has suffered fire damage or damage caused by extreme
weather conditions shall be exempt from the registration requirement for a
period of 90 days after the date of the fire or extreme weather event if the
property owner submits a request for exemption in writing to the Service-Safety
Director or his duly designated representative. This request shall include the
names and addresses of the owner or owners, and a statement of intent to repair
and reoccupy the building in an expedient manner, or the intent to demolish the
building. One extension of not more than 90 days' duration may be granted for
good cause shown.
   (c)   A building that is for sale and listed with a licensed State of Ohio
Realtor shall be exempted for a period of 12 months from the start of vacancy,
provided that the owner submits proof to the Service-Safety Director or his
duly designated representative of such listing and for sale status, and the
building and premises in maintained free of any Property Maintenance Violations
   (d)   A building that has been granted an exemption pursuant to the
following: Any owner of a vacant building may voluntarily register the same and
request an exemption from the remaining provisions of this chapter by filing a
written application with the Service-Safety Director or his duly designated
representative, who shall timely consider same. In determining whether a
request for exemption should be granted, the Director shall consider the
following: the applicant's prior record as it pertains to City Zoning Code,
Building Code, or Property Maintenance Code violations; the amount of vacant
property the applicant currently has within the City; the length of time that
the building for which the exception is sought has been vacant; the reason or
reasons for the vacancy; and the difficulty or expense involved in any
necessary remediation or demolition. No exemption from registration shall be
granted unless the owner or representative first completes a vacant building
plan under Section
 1320.03(c) and addresses any and all existing code violations. An owner who
believes he or she is being denied an exemption for arbitrary or capricious
reasons may file an appeal of such denial within ten days with the Board of
Building Appeals, which may sustain, overturn or modify the action of the
Service-Safety Director or his duly designated representative. (Ord. 15-82.
Passed 12-8-15.)
   1320.07 APPEALS.
   Any owner who is served a notice of vacant property registration, may,
within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of such notice, apply for an exemption
or appeal the decision as set forth in Section

agency or by contact or arrangement with private persons, and the cost thereof
shall be collected in accordance with subsection (c) hereof.
   (b)    In the event this Code Official determines that a vacant and
unsecured structure, poses an immediate danger to the safety or wellbeing of

necessary legal action to collect all such expenses.
   (d)    No structure which has been closed under this section, or which
otherwise has been closed or boarded-up by any other person, shall remain
closed or boarded-up for a period longer than six months. The repair shall
result in openings secured by conventional methods used in the design of the
building or by methods permitted for new construction of similar type. No owner
of a structure, or other person legally responsible for a structure, shall fail
to repair any doors, windows or other openings which are boarded up or
otherwise secured by any means other than conventional methods used in the
design of the building or permitted for new construction of a similar type, or
fail to cause the structure to be in compliance with this Property Maintenance
Code after the expiration of said six-month period.
   (e)    All doors, windows and other openings shall be covered with a minimum
of one-half inch thick painted structural sheeting material or solid nominal
one inch lumber, closely butted at the edges and maintained. Such coverings may
be installed to fit over the exterior casing or to fit tightly inside the
exterior casing coverings the sash area only. However, there shall not be any
edges or cracks that will serve as handholds for tearing off of the same. All
coverings shall be anchored by nails or screws and shall not be capable of
being removed without tools. Any porch floor, railing, post or roof, or any
other attachment to the structure, in danger of falling or causing injury by
being decayed or having holes that could cause tripping or falling, shall be

1416.12 ORDER TO RAZE OR REPAIR STRUCTURE.
   The Code Official may order the owner of any premises upon which is located
any structure or part thereof, which in the judgment of the Service- Safety
Director or Fire Chief or their designee is so old, dilapidated or has become
so out of repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for
human habitation, occupancy or use, and so that it would be unreasonable to
repair the same, to raze and remove such structure or part thereof; or, if it
can be made safe by repairs, to repair and make safe and sanitary or to raze
and remove at the owner's option within sixty days of such order. In the event,
the owner, within such sixty day period, elects to repair the subject premises,
such repairs shall commence within such sixty day period and shall, in all
cases, be completed within four months of the original order given by the Code
Official.
   (a)   Whenever the Code Official determines that the cost of such repairs
would exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the current value of such structure,
such repairs shall be presumed unreasonable and it shall be presumed for the
purposes of this chapter that such structure is a public nuisance which may be
ordered razed without option on the part of the owner to repair.
   (b)   Whenever the owner of a property fails to comply with a demolition
order within the time prescribed, the Service-Safety Director or Fire Chief or
their designee shall cause the structure or part thereof to be razed and
removed, either through an available public agency or by contract or
arrangement with private persons. The expenses therefore call be the
responsibility of the owner of the premises.
   (c)   In the event that the owner or other appropriate person fails to pay
the expenses for the work performed pursuant to subsection (b) hereof, within
thirty days after being notified in writing, by regular U.S. mail, of the

or more of the following methods provided, however, that the expenses may only
be collected once:
      (1)    Such expenses may be submitted by the Code Official to the County
Auditor and placed upon the tax duplicate for collection as a special
assessment and thereupon shall be collected as other taxes and assessments; or
      (2)    The Director of Law is authorized to bring suit and take other
necessary legal action to collect all such expenses.
