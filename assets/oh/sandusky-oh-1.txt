ADOPTING ORDINANCE NO.  98-226
AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE THE 1998 CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO ADOPT NEW MATTER; AND
TO AMEND AND REPEAL CERTAIN OBSOLETE AND CONFLICTING LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS.
   WHEREAS, a determination has been made that the ordinances of the City of a
permanent and general nature should be recodified, and
   WHEREAS, the City has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H.
Drane Company to prepare and publish such recodification, and
   WHEREAS, the recodification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Commission, NOW THEREFORE
   BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF SANDUSKY, OHIO:
   Section 1. That the ordinances of the City of Sandusky, Ohio, of a general
and permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the City of Sandusky, Ohio, 1998.
   Section 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 5 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to July 1, 1998, which are inconsistent with any provision of the
Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance, except as follows: the enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall
not be construed to affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any
legislative provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an
action or proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such
enactment shall not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an
act committed in violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an
indictment or prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative
provision shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the
purpose of revision and recodification.
   Section 3. That each section of the Codified Ordinances without an ordinance
or resolution history at the end thereof indicates that the section contains
new material which is hereby enacted by this adopting ordinance. Publication of
this ordinance shall constitute sufficient publication of all new matter
contained in the Codified Ordinances.
   Section 4. That through authentication and approval of this Ordinance the
President of the City Commission and Clerk of the Commission shall certify that
the permanent and general ordinances of the Municipality as codified therein

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

PREAMBLE
   We, the people of the City of Sandusky Ohio, grateful to Almighty God for
our freedom to secure its blessings and promote our common welfare, pursuant to
the provisions of the Constitution of the State of Ohio, extending to
municipalities the privilege of "home-rule," in order to secure for ourselves
and posterity practical and efficient methods in administrating the affairs of
the City, to protect the interests and insure the continued general welfare of
the community, and to enjoy all the privileges of local self-government, do
adopt this Charter. (Amended 11-7-89)
POWERS OF THE CITY
S 1 NAME AND POWERS.
   The inhabitants of the City of Sandusky, Ohio, as its limits now are or
hereafter may be established, shall continue to be a body politic and
corporate, to be known and designated as "The City of Sandusky, Ohio," and as
such shall have perpetual succession. It shall have, and may exercise, all
powers which now or hereafter it would be competent for this Charter
specifically to enumerate, as fully and completely as though said powers were
specifically enumerated herein; and no enumeration of particular powers by this
Charter shall be held to be exclusive.
S 1(a) TAX RATE FOR TERRITORY WITHIN CITY BUT OUTSIDE SANDUSKY CITY SCHOOL
DISTRICT.
   In any year that any part of the territorial limits of the City is not
within the territorial limits of the Sandusky City School District, that part
of the total tax rate levied by the City which would otherwise cause the
aggregate rate of taxes levied without a vote of the people upon any property
in the City to exceed 10 mills, because of the tax rates of overlapping
subdivisions allowable by law within the 10 mill limitation, shall be levied
outside of the 10 mill limitation, so that in each year the City shall be able
to levy taxes at a uniform rate throughout the entire City without a vote of
the electors. (Amend. passed by the voters 8-29-60)
S 1(b) GENDER.
   All references to gender in this Charter shall designate both sexes and
wherever the male gender is used, it shall be deemed to include both male and
female counterparts. (Added 11-7-89)
S 1(c) COMPLIANCE WITH OPEN MEETING LAWS.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Charter, all meetings held
pursuant to this Charter shall comply in all respects with the open meeting
laws as then in force and effect in the State of Ohio.
(Added 11-7-89)
FORM OF GOVERNMENT
S 2 FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
   The form of government provided in this Charter shall be known as the
"Commission-Manager Plan," and shall consist of a commission of 7 citizens, who
shall be elected at large in manner hereinafter provided. The City Commission
shall constitute the governing body with powers as hereinafter provided to pass
ordinances, adopt regulations, appoint a chief administrative officer to be
known as the "City Manager," and exercise all powers hereinafter provided.
(Amend. passed by the voters 11-7-78)
THE CITY COMMISSION
S 3 CITY COMMISSION. CREATION AND POWERS.
   There is hereby created, commencing January 1, 1980, a City Commission to
consist of 7 electors of the City elected at large, each of whom shall be
elected for a term of 4 years beginning January 1, after their elections, as
hereinafter set forth. Four of the City Commissioners shall be elected at the
Municipal election to be held in 1979 and in alternate Municipal elections
thereafter; three shall be elected at the Municipal election to be held in 1981
and in alternate Municipal elections thereafter.
   No person shall be qualified to be elected to the City Commission or to be
appointed to fill an unexpired term of more than two (2) years of another
person’s election or appointment to the City Commission if serving the term
being sought in an election or the balance of the term to which the appointment
is being made would result in the person serving on the City Commission more
than twelve (12) years of the sixteen (16) year period ending the end of the
term to which the person is seeking election or to which the person would be
appointed. For purposes of determining whether a person is qualified to be
elected, the filling of an unexpired City Commission Member term of less than 2
years shall not constitute a term, and the period of less than two (2) years
shall not be used for purposes of calculating whether a City Commission Member
has exceeded twelve (12) years of service in a sixteen (16) year period. This
limitation shall be effective for all terms that commence or appointments that
are effective on or after November 8, 2016.
   All of the powers of the City, except such as are vested in the Board of
Education and except as otherwise provided by this Charter or by the
Constitution of the State, are hereby vested in the City Commission; and except
as otherwise prescribed by this Charter or by the Constitution of the State,
the City Commission may by ordinance or resolution prescribe the manner in
which any power of the City shall be exercised. In the absence of such
provision as to any power, such power shall be exercised in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed by the general laws of the State applicable to
municipalities.
(Amended 11-8-16.)
S 4 QUALIFICATIONS.
   Each member of the City Commission, for at least 3 years immediately prior
to his or her election shall have been, and during his or her term of office
shall continue to be, a resident of the City of Sandusky, Ohio, and shall have
the qualifications of an elector therein. He or she shall not hold any other
public office except in the State militia, except as otherwise provided in this
Charter, and shall not be interested in the profits or emoluments of any
contract, job, work, or service for the Municipality. Any Commissioner who
shall cease to possess any of the qualification herein required shall forthwith
forfeit his or her office, and any such contract in which any member is or may
become interested may be declared void by the City Commission.
   A candidate may cause notice of his or her candidacy to be published and may
circulate or procure the circulation of a petition for his or her nomination.
Nothing in this section shall preclude a write-in candidacy. He or she shall
not promise any money, office, employment, or other thing of value to secure a
nomination or election; but may expend money to finance his or her campaign for
election to the extent permitted by law. A violation of these provisions, or
any of them, shall disqualify him or her from holding the office, if elected;
and the person receiving the next highest number of votes, who has observed the
foregoing conditions, shall be entitled to the office. (Amended 11-7-89)
S 5 VACANCIES.
   The first vacancy in the City Commission which occurs following any regular
municipal election shall be filled by the candidate for City Commissioner at
that election who had the highest number of votes but was not elected, provided
he or she is then still qualified to serve and is willing to serve. When such a
vacancy occurs, the Clerk of the City Commission within 7 days shall notify
such candidate of the vacancy and he or she shall have 30 days from the time
the vacancy occurs to assume office. Notice by first class mail addressed to
the candidate at the address shown on his or her nominating petition shall be
sufficient compliance by the Clerk.
   When a vacancy in the City Commission occurs and is not filled by the method
specified in the preceding paragraph, the vacancy shall be filled by the
remaining members by a majority vote. In the event that the vacancy is not
filled in 60 days from the time it occurs, then it shall be filled by the Civil
Service Commission, and its Clerk shall cause his certificate of its action to
be entered on the journal of the City Commission.
   If, by reason of resignations, deaths, failure to elect, or other
circumstance, so many vacancies exist or occur at the same time in said City
Commission that the number of City Commissioners is less than a majority of the
full membership, then the Civil Service Commission shall make such number of
appointments as may be necessary to constitute a City Commission of qualified
members constituting a majority of the full membership, which majority shall
then proceed to fill the remaining vacancies as hereinbefore provided. The
Clerk of the Civil Service Commission shall cause his certificate of its action
to be entered on the journal of the City Commission.
   In any case where the Civil Service Commission neglects or fails to make an
appointment for 10 days, the appointment shall be made by the senior judge of
the Common Pleas Court of Erie County, Ohio.
   In any case where a vacancy occurs, if the term of the office filled or to
be filled does not expire for 2 or more years after the next municipal election
following such vacancy, and such vacancy occurs not less than 105 days prior to
the next municipal election, an additional City Commissioner shall then be
elected; and, of those City Commissioners elected at such election, the one
having the lowest vote shall then succeed to and serve the unexpired term. In
the event of more than one vacancy to be so filled by election the same
provision shall apply.
(Amend. passed by the voters 11-8-77)
S 6 SALARY AND BONDS.
   Commencing January 1, 2021, the annual salary of each City Commissioner
shall be the yearly sum of the minimum monthly salary required to qualify as
full service credit with the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System and
payable according to the established payroll practices
of the City; and each City Commissioner shall give bond in the sum of $5,000
with a bonding company regularly accredited to do business in the State of Ohio
as surety thereon, to the approval of the City Treasurer; and the premium of
each bond shall be paid by the City. The bonds of the City Commissioners shall
be filed with the City Treasurer.
   The president shall receive $20 per week in addition to his or her salary as
a City Commissioner during the time he or she shall serve as president, payable
with his or her salary as a City Commissioner. (Amended 11-2-99; 11-3-20)
S 7 PRESIDENT.
   The City Commission may at the time of organizing elect by secret ballot,
one of its members as President and another as Vice-President for terms of 2
years. In case the members of the City Commission within 5 days after the time
herein fixed for their organization meeting, are unable to agree upon a
President or a Vice-President of such City Commission, then a President, or a
Vice-President, or both as the occasion may require, shall be elected from all
the members of such City Commission by lot conducted by the Law Director; who
shall certify the result of such selection by lot upon the journal of the City
Commission.
   The President shall preside at all meetings of the City Commission and
perform such other duties consistent with his or her office as may be imposed
by it; and he or she shall have a voice and vote in its proceedings, but no
veto. He or she may use the title of Mayor in any case in which the execution
of legal instruments of writing or other necessity arising from the general law
of the State so requires; but this shall not be construed as conferring upon
him or her the administrative functions of a mayor under the general laws of
Ohio, but he or she shall have the judicial functions of a mayor under the laws
of Ohio until such time as such judicial functions can or may be by and under
authority of the Constitution and general laws of the State performed by some
other officer appointed or elected for that purpose.
   The President of the City Commission shall be recognized as the official
head of the City by the courts for the purpose of serving civil process, by the
Governor for the purpose of military law, and for all ceremonial purposes. He
or she may take command of the police and govern the City by proclamation
during times of public danger or emergency, and he or she shall himself or
herself be judge of what constitutes such public danger or emergency. However,
such a public danger or emergency proclamation of the President of the City
Commission may be terminated at any time by an affirmative vote of 4 members of
the City Commission. The powers and duties of the President shall be such as
are conferred upon him or her by this Charter, together with such others as are
conferred by the City Commission in pursuance of the provisions of this
Charter, and no others.
   If the President be temporarily absent from the City, or becomes temporarily
disabled from any cause, his or her duties shall be performed during such
absence or disability by the Vice-President. In the absence of both President
and Vice-President, the other members of the City Commission shall select one
of their number to perform the duties of President.
(Amended 11-7-89)
S 8 MUNICIPAL BONDS.
   The City Commission shall, subject to all the limitations of and in the
manner prescribed by the general laws of Ohio, have the same power and
authority to issue the bonds of the Municipality as is vested by said laws in
city councils, except, that in cases of municipal bond issues requiring the
approval of the electors of the Municipality, such bonds may and shall be
issued and sold if a majority of the voters voting at the election upon the
question of issuing such bonds, vote in favor thereof.
S 9 CLERK AND EMPLOYEES.
   The City Commission shall appoint a Clerk who shall be known as the Clerk of
the City Commission, and who shall keep a record of the proceedings of the City
Commission and perform such other duties as may be prescribed by this Charter
or by the City Commission. It may also appoint and employ such other officers
and employees of its body as are necessary.
S 10 MEETINGS.
   The City Commission shall meet at such times as may be prescribed by
ordinance or resolution. The President, and 2 members of the City Commission,
or the City Manager, may call a special meeting of the City Commission. All
meetings of the City Commission shall comply in all respects with the open
meeting laws as then in force and effect in the State of Ohio. The City
Commission shall determine its own rules and order of business and shall keep a
journal of its proceedings. (Amended 11-7-89)
S 11 PENALTY FOR ABSENCE.
   Absence from three (3) consecutive regular meetings or from more than fifty
percent (50%) of the regular meetings held in any ninety (90) day period, shall
operate to vacate the seat of a member unless the absence is excused by a
majority vote of the Commission and entered upon the Journal of the City
Commission.
(Amended 11-5-96)
S 12 LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE.
   A majority of all the members elected to the City Commission shall be a
quorum to do business, but a less number may adjourn from day to day and compel
the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as may
be prescribed by ordinance. The affirmative vote of at least 4 of the members
shall be necessary to adopt any ordinance or resolution; and the vote upon the
passage of all ordinances and resolutions shall be taken by “yeas” and “nays”
and entered upon the journal.
(Amend. passed by the voters 11-7-78)
S 13 ORDINANCE ENACTMENT.
   Each proposed ordinance or resolution shall be introduced in written or
printed form, and shall not contain more than one subject which shall be
clearly stated in the title; but general appropriation ordinances may contain
the various subjects, and accounts for which moneys are to be appropriated. The
enacting clause of all ordinances passed by the City Commission shall be: “Be
it ordained by the City Commission of the City of Sandusky, Ohio.” The enacting
clause of all ordinances submitted to popular election by the initiative shall
be: “Be it ordained by the people of the City of Sandusky, Ohio.”
   No ordinance or resolution of a general or permanent nature, or granting a
franchise, or creating a right, or involving the expenditure of money or the
levying of a tax, or for the purchase, lease, sale or transfer of property,
unless it be an emergency measure or unless otherwise provided by this Charter,
shall be passed until it has been read at 2 regular meetings not less than one
week apart, or the requirement for such reading has been dispensed with by an
affirmative vote of 5 of the members of the City Commission. No ordinance or
resolution or section thereof shall be revised or amended unless the new
ordinance or resolution contains the entire ordinance or resolution or section
revised or amended, and the original ordinance, resolution, section or sections
so amended shall be repealed.
(Amend. passed by the voters 11-7-78)
S 14 EMERGENCY MEASURES.
   All ordinances and resolutions passed by the City Commission shall be in
effect from and after 30 days from the date of their passage, except that the
City Commission may, by an affirmative vote of 5 of its members, pass emergency
measures to take effect at the time indicated therein.
   Any emergency measure is an ordinance or resolution for the immediate
preservation of the public peace, property, health, or safety, or providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department, in which the emergency is
set forth and defined in a preamble thereto. Ordinances appropriating money may
be passed as emergency measures, but no measure making a grant, renewal or
extension of a franchise or other special privilege, or regulating the rate to
be charged for its service by any public utility, shall ever be so passed.
(Amend. passed by the voters 11-7-78)
S 15 RECORD AND PUBLICATION.
   Every ordinance or resolution upon its final passage shall be recorded in a
book kept for that purpose, and shall be authenticated by the signature of the
presiding
officer and the Clerk of the City Commission. Every ordinance of a general or
permanent nature shall be published once within 10 days after its final passage
in the manner hereinafter provided.
   Ordinances and resolutions providing for public improvements, to pay the
cost of which special assessments are to be made, need not be published; but
within 10 days after the passage of each a notice shall be published as
follows, the same being in addition to the notice required by law to be served
on the property owners.
   As to the resolution declaring the necessity of the proposed improvements, a
notice shall be published headed "Notice of Public Improvement," stating when
the same was adopted by the City Commission, and setting forth the general
nature and the extent of such improvements including any change of street grade
that is to be made, what part of the cost thereof is to be assessed against the
property to be especially benefited thereby, and when water, gas, or other
street connections must be made.
   As to the ordinance determining to proceed with the improvement, a notice
shall be published headed "Notice of Determination to Proceed with Public
Improvement," stating when the City Commission adopted the same, describing the
character and extent of the improvement in general terms, and setting forth
within what time assessments on property specially benefited may be paid in
cash, and for what period and at what interest bonds will be issued for that
portion of the assessment not so paid.
   In regard to the ordinance to provide for the issue of bonds, a notice shall
be published headed "Notice of Bond Issue for Public Improvement," stating when
the City Commission adopted the same, describing the improvement in general
terms, and stating the total amount of bonds to be issued, in what
denomination, when maturing, how to be dated and numbered, the rate of
interest, when and where payable, and the lowest price at which any portion of
such bonds will be offered at public sale. Wherever practicable notices of the
same character required to be published regarding separate improvements shall
be combined into one notice under a single heading.
   No resolution declaring it necessary to proceed with any public improvement
shall be adopted until complete plans, specifications, profiles and estimates
have been submitted to the City Commission and have been approved by it; and
the same, or a copy thereof, shall thereafter remain on file in the office of
the City Engineer subject to inspection by the public.
(Amended 11-7-89)
S 16 PRICE AND MODE OF PUBLICATION.
   All of the above mentioned publications, as well as all other newspaper
publications made by the City, shall be published in a newspaper or newspapers
of general circulation in the Municipality, and, where legally permissible,
such publication shall be made but once and in one newspaper only.
   The newspaper carrying such publication shall be paid a price per inch of
space used at the lowest and best rate offered. Whenever it may appear to the
City Commission that the rates offered by such newspapers are unfair, such
other means of securing due publicity may be employed, in lieu of newspaper
advertising, as the City Commission may by resolution determine.
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS AND DEPARTMENTS
S 17 LAW DIRECTOR AND ASSISTANTS.
   The City Manager, with the concurrence of a majority of the members of the
City Commission, shall appoint a Law Director who shall at all times be
licensed and in good standing to practice law in the State of Ohio, and who
shall hold office at the pleasure of the City Manager. The Law Director and his
assistants shall act as the legal advisors to, and attorneys and counsel for,
the Municipality and all of its officers in matters relating to their duties.
The Law Director or his or her assistants shall prepare all contracts, bonds,
and other instruments in writing in which the Municipality is concerned, and
shall endorse on each approval of the form and correctness thereof; and no
contract with the Municipality shall take effect until such approval is thus
endorsed thereon. The Law Director or his or her assistants shall be the
prosecutor or prosecutors in the Municipal Court, and shall perform such other
duties as the City Commission may by ordinance authorize. In addition to such
duties the Law Director and his or her assistants shall perform such other
duties as may be required of them by the City Manager, as well as such as may
be required by law directors by the general laws of the State applicable to
municipalities and not inconsistent with this Charter or with any ordinance or
resolution that may be passed by the City Commission.
   The Law Director and his or her assistants shall have the power at any time
to cause the affairs of any department or the conduct of any officer or
employee to be investigated, but upon request of the City Manager or City
Commission it shall be mandatory upon the Law Director or his or her assistants
to make such investigation.
   The Law Director or an assistant shall be required to attend all meetings of
the City Commission, except when excused by the City Commission and the Law
Director or an assistant shall give an opinion in writing when so requested, to
the City Commission, to the City Manager, or to the head of any department or
the head of any office not connected with a department, upon any question of
law involving their respective powers and duties.
   Wherever in the Charter the term "City Solicitor" is used it shall be deemed
to refer to Law Director pursuant to this section.
(Amended 11-3-15)
S 18 DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AUDITS.
   There is hereby created a Department of Finance and Audits to be headed by
an officer known as the Finance Director. This office shall be held by a person
especially qualified by education and experience for such position.
   The City Manager, with the concurrence of a majority of the members of the
City Commission, shall appoint a Finance Director who shall hold office at the
pleasure of the City Manager. He or she shall be the custodian of all moneys of
the Municipality, and shall keep and preserve the same in such manner and in

S 65 STATE LAWS TO APPLY.
The provisions for the initiative and referendum in municipal corporations, now

THE RECALL
S 66 RECALL PETITIONS.
   Any or all members of the City Commission may be removed from office by the
electors by the following procedure:
   A petition for the recall of the City Commissioner or City Commissioners
designated, signed by at least 10% of the total number of persons voting at the
last preceding municipal election, and containing a statement of not more than
200 words of the grounds of the recall, shall be filed with the Finance
Director and he or she shall examine the same and ascertain and certify thereon
whether the signatures thereto amount to at least 10% of the number of persons
voting at the last preceding municipal election and he or she shall forthwith
notify the City Commissioner or City Commissioners sought to be removed, and he
or they within 5 days after such notice, may file with such Finance Director a
defensive statement in not exceeding 200 words. The Finance Director shall at
once upon the expiration of said 5 days cause sufficient printed or typewritten
copies of such petition, without the signatures, to be made, and to each of
them he or she shall attach a printed or typewritten copy of such defensive
statement, if one is furnished him or her within the time provided. He or she
shall cause one copy of such petition to be placed on file in his or her
office, and provide facilities for their signing the same, and he or she shall
also cause one copy to be placed in each of the several fire engine houses of
the City, where the same shall be in the custody of the captain of the house,
or his or her designee, who shall provide facilities for their signing the
same. The Finance Director shall immediately cause notice to be published in
some newspaper of general circulation in the City of the placing of such copies
of such petition.
   Such copies of such petition shall remain on file in the several places
designated for the period of 30 days, during which time any of them may be
signed by any elector of the City in person; but not by agent or attorney. Each
signer of any of such copies shall sign his or her name in ink, and shall place
thereafter his or her residence by street and number. (Amended 11-7-89)
S 67 NOTICE.
   At the expiration of said period of 30 days the City Treasurer shall
assemble all of said copies in his office as one instrument, and shall examine
the same and ascertain and certify thereon whether the signatures thereto
amount to at least 15% of the number of persons voting at the last preceding
municipal election. If such signatures do amount to such percent, he shall at
once serve notice of that fact upon the City Commissioner or City Commissioners
designated in the petition, and also deliver to the election authorities a copy
of the original petition with his certificate as to the percentage of
registered voters who signed the same, and a certificate as to the date of his
last mentioned notice to the City Commissioner or City Commissioners designated
in the petition.
S 68 RECALL ELECTION.
   If the City Commissioner or City Commissioners or any of them, designated in
the petition, file with the Clerk of the City Commission within 5 days after
the last mentioned notice from the City Treasurer his or their written
resignation, the Clerk of the City Commission shall at once notify the election
authorities of that fact and such resignation shall be irrevocable, and the
City Commission shall proceed to fill the vacancy. In the absence of any such
resignation the election authorities shall forthwith order and fix a day for
holding a recall election for the removal of those not resigning. Any such
election shall be held not less than 30 nor more than 60 days after the
expiration of the period of 5 days last mentioned, and at the same time as any
other general or special election held within such period; but if no such
election be held within such period the election authorities shall call a
special recall election to be held within the period aforesaid.
S 69 BALLOTS.
   The ballots at such recall election shall conform to the following
requirements. With respect to each person whose removal is sought, the question
shall be submitted:
   "Shall (name of person) be removed from the office of City Commissioner by
recall?" Immediately following such question there shall be printed on the
ballots the 2 propositions in the order here set forth:
   "For the recall of (name of person)."
   "Against the recall of (name of person)."
   Immediately to the left of each of the propositions shall be placed a square
in which the electors, by making a cross mark (X), may vote for either of such
propositions.
S 70 FILLING OF VACANCIES.
   In any such election, if a majority of the votes cast on the question of
removal of any City Commissioner are affirmative, the person whose removal is
sought shall thereupon be deemed removed from office upon the announcement of
the official canvass of that election, and the vacancy caused by such recall
shall be filled by the remainder of the City Commission according to the
provisions of S
5  of this Charter.
   If, however, an election is held for the recall of more than 2
Commissioners, candidates to succeed them for their unexpired terms shall be
voted upon at the same election, and shall be nominated by petitions signed,
dated and verified in the manner required for petitions presenting names of
candidates for nomination at a regular election, and similar in form to such
petitions, and signed by electors equal in number to at least 5% of the total
number of votes cast at the last preceding municipal election and filed with
the election authorities at least 20 days prior to such recall election. But no
such nominating petition shall be signed or circulated until after the time has
expired for signing the copies of the petition for the recall, and any
signatures thereon antedating such time shall not be counted.
S 71 COUNTING THE VOTES.
   Candidates shall not be nominated to succeed any particular City
Commissioner, but if only one City Commissioner is removed at such election,
the candidate at such election receiving the highest number of votes shall be
declared elected to fill the vacancy; and if more than one City Commissioner is
removed at such election, such candidates equal in number to the number of City
Commissioners removed shall be declared elected to fill the vacancies; and
among the successful candidates, those receiving the greater number of votes
shall be declared elected for the longer terms. Cases of ties and all other
matters not herein specifically provided for, shall be determined by the rules
governing elections generally.
S 72 EFFECT OF RESIGNATIONS.
   No proceedings for the recall of all of the members of the City Commission
at the same election shall be defeated in whole or in part by the resignation
of any or all of them, but upon the resignation of any of them the City
Commission shall have power to fill the vacancy until a successor is elected,
and the proceedings for the recall and the elections of successors shall
continue and have the same effect as though there had been no resignation.
S 73 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   No person removed by recall shall be eligible to be elected or appointed
upon or for a period of 2 years after the date of such recall. The City
Treasurer shall preserve in his office all papers comprising or connected with
a petition for a recall for the period of one year after the same were filed.
The method of removal herein provided is in addition to such other methods as
are, or may be, provided by general law.

reasonable times to the inspection of the public.
   On and after January 1, 1916, it shall be the duty of the City Commission to
carry out the foregoing provisions of this section in the subsequent

of this Charter or by any ordinance or resolution of the City hereafter
enacted.
S 79 CONTINUANCE OF CONTRACTS AND VESTED RIGHTS.

S 83 SAVING CLAUSE.
   If any section or part of a section of this Charter proves to be invalid or

is wholly or necessarily dependent for its operation upon the section or part
of a section so held unconstitutional or invalid.

   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is

   101.06 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
(c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
(2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings of
Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to be
harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the amendments
are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment prevails. The
fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an earlier amendment,
or fails to include language inserted by an earlier amendment, does not of
itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments are irreconcilable only
when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into simultaneous operation.

is intended;

(3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
(4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
(1)   The object sought to be attained;
(2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
(3)   The legislative history;
(4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws upon the
same or similar subjects;
(5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
(6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an

reasonable times and shall provide verification or authentication of the same,
as the Finance Director may require. The Finance Director and their agents are
hereby authorized to examine the books, papers and records of any operator or
suspected operator in order to verify the accuracy of any return made, or, if
no return has been made, to determine the taxes due. Every operator is hereby
required and directed to provide to the Finance Director and their designated
agents the means, facilities and opportunity to conduct any examinations or
investigations as are hereby authorized.
   (d)    Audits. The Finance Director shall have, at reasonable times during
normal business hours, the right to examination and audit of all account books
and records of any person responsible for the collection and remittance of the
tax herein imposed and levied which, in the Finance Director’s opinion, in any
way pertain to the parking receipts. This audit is to be made by the Finance
Director or by accountants employed by the City and at its own expense. If
required by the Finance Director, a complete audit of a personfs gross parking
receipts shall be provided at the end of each person’s fiscal year by an
accountant approved by the Finance Director and at the expense of the City.

expenses of the audit.

(Ord. 21-174. Passed 11-8-21.)
   189.07 FINANCE DIRECTOR’S POWER AND DUTIES; APPARENT VIOLATION.
   (a)    If it shall appear to the Finance Director that any person has
violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation promulgated
hereunder, or if the amount of any tax payment is incorrect in that it does not
include all taxes payable for a month, or if the Finance Director shall find
that the collection of any taxes which have accrued but are not yet due will be
jeopardized by delay, and declares said taxes to be immediately due and
payable, or if it shall appear to the Finance Director that any final
assessment did not include all taxes payable for the periods involved, or if it
appears to the Finance Director that any person has, by reason of any act or
omission or by operation of law, become liable for the payment of any taxes,
interest or penalties not originally incurred by him, the Finance Director may
in any of the above events determine and assess the amount of such taxes or
deficiency, as the case may be, together with the interest and penalties due
and unpaid, and immediately serve notice upon such person of such determination
and assessment and make a demand for payment of such taxes, interest and
penalties. If the person against whom such assessment is, or could have been,
made has died, such assessment may at the discretion of the Finance Director be
made against their personal representatives. Such determination and assessment
by the Finance Director shall become final upon the expiration of twenty (20)
days from the date of the service of such written notice thereof and demand for
payment, unless prior to such expiration such person shall have filed with the
Finance Director a written protest and a petition for a hearing, specifying its
objections thereto. Upon the receipt of such protest and petition, the Finance
Director shall fix the time and place for a hearing and shall notify the
petitioner thereof. The Finance Director may amend their determination and
assessment at any time before it becomes final. In the event of such amendment
the petitioner shall be given notice thereof and an opportunity to be heard. At
any hearing held as herein provided, the determination and assessment by the
Finance Director shall be prima facie correct and the burden shall be upon the
petitioner to prove that it is incorrect. Upon the conclusion of such hearing a
decision shall be made by the Finance Director either canceling, increasing,
modifying or affirming such determination and assessment and notice thereof
given to the Petitioner. Such decision shall become final upon the expiration
of twenty (20) days from the date notice of the decision is provided to the
petitioner, unless prior thereto the petitioner shall have filed an appeal to
the Board of Review pursuant to Section
189.12.
   (b)    Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax as herein provided, the
Law Director shall, upon the request of the Finance Director, bring or cause to
be brought an action to enforce the payment of said tax on behalf of the City
in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 21-174. Passed 11-8-21.)
   189.08  CREDIT OR REFUND; CLAIM PROCEDURES.
   (a)    Whenever it appears that an amount of tax, interest or penalty has
been paid to the Finance Director in error, whether such amount be paid through
a mistake of fact or an error of law other than an error resulting from the
tax, any of its provisions or its application being declared invalid or
unconstitutional, not later than three (3) years from the date upon which such
payment was made, the person paying such tax (hereinafter referred to as
”claimant”) may file a claim for credit or refund with the City on forms
provided by the Finance Director for that purpose. No credit or refund shall be
allowed for any amount paid by any claimant unless such claimant bore the
burden of such amount and did not shift the burden to another person.
   (b)    Any credit or refund that is allowed under this section shall be
without interest.
   (c)    A claim for credit or refund shall be considered to have been filed
with the Finance Director on the date upon which it is physically received by
the Finance Director and receipt of any claim for credit or refund filed under
this section shall be acknowledged by the Finance Director, said receipt to
describe the claim in sufficient detail as to identify it, and to state the
date upon which the claim was received by the Finance Director.
   (d)    As soon as practicable after a claim for credit or refund is filed,
the Finance Director shall examine the same and determine the amount of credit
or refund due, if any, and shall issue a notice of tentative determination of
claim and notify the claimant of such determination. If the claimant disagrees
with the determination, he shall file a protest and challenge thereto within
twenty (20) days after the date of notice of tentative determination of claim
has been mailed to him. Upon receipt of such protest within the twenty (20)
days allowed, the Finance Director or their designee, shall fix the time and
place for a hearing thereof, giving notice to the claimant of, not less than
seven (7) days. At any hearing held as herein provided, the tentative
determination of claim shall be prima facie correct and the burden shall be
upon the claimant to prove that it is incorrect. Upon the conclusion of the
hearing, a decision shall be made by the Finance Director and notice thereof
given to the claimant. Such tentative determination of claim shall become final
upon the expiration of twenty (20) days from the date notice of the
determination is provided to the claimant, unless prior thereto the claimant
shall have filed an appeal to the Board of Review pursuant to Section
191.08.
(Ord. 21-174. Passed 11-8-21.)
   189.09 NOTICE.
   Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, whenever notice is required by
this chapter, such notice may be given by the United States registered or
certified mail, addressed to the person concerned at their last known address,
and proof of such mailing shall be sufficient for the purposes of this chapter.
Notice of any hearing provided for by this chapter shall be given not less than
seven (7) days prior to the date fixed for a hearing. Following the initial
contact of a person represented by an attorney, the Finance Director shall not
thereafter contact the person concerned but shall only contact the attorney
representing the person concerned.
   All hearings provided for in this chapter shall be at a location determined
by the Finance Director. (Ord. 21-174. Passed 11-8-21.)
   189.10 RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.
   (a)    Agency. Where an operator performs their functions through a managing
agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall
also be deemed an operator for purposes of this chapter and shall have the same
duties and liabilities as their principal. Where the managing agent collects
parking occupancy tax on behalf of their principal, such principal shall be
jointly responsible for reporting and remitting the tax to the City. Compliance
with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing
agent shall be considered to be compliance by both.
   (b)    Joint and Several Liabilities for Tax, Interest, and Penalties.
      (1)    The operator shall be liable for the payment of all taxes required
to be collected under this chapter, including interest and penalties thereon.
      (2)    Any officer, employee, or agent of an operator subject to the
provisions of this chapter who has the control, supervision or responsibility
of collecting such tax, filing returns or making payment of the taxes herein
imposed who willfully fails to collect the tax, file required returns, or make
tax payments when due to the Finance Director shall be jointly and severally
liable with the operator for all taxes due under this chapter, including
interest and penalties thereon. This personal liability of such officer,
employee, or agent shall survive the merger, acquisition, liquidation, or
dissolution of the operator.
      (3)    Any facility owner who knowingly permits its parking facility to
be used by an operator in the ordinary course of such operatorfs parking
service shall be jointly and severally liable with the operator for all taxes
due under this chapter, including interest and penalties thereon. Any amounts
due hereunder shall be reduced to a lien on the parking facility.
         (Ord. 21-174. Passed 11-8-21.)
   189.11  SALE OR TRANSFER; NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES.
   An operator who sells or transfers their business of operating one or more
parking facilities in the City or a major part of the assets of such business,
other than a sale of assets, including inventory, in the ordinary and usual
course of such business, must file a notice of such intended sale or transfer
with the Finance Director at least forty-five (45) days prior to the date of
such sale or transfer, setting forth the name of the seller or transferor,
purchaser or transferee, and a description of the property or business sold.
Within thirty (30) days after such sale or transfer, such seller shall file any
remittance returns and pay any taxes due and not paid up to the date of sale or
transfer. At least forty-five (45) days before the closing of the sale or
transfer referred to above, the purchaser or transferee shall also file a
notice of intended purchaser or acquisition with the Finance Director, setting
forth the same information as required in the seller’s or transferor’s notice
and further requesting that the Finance Director perform an audit of the
seller’s or transferor’s books and records or do whatever is necessary to
determine the amount of taxes due up to the date of sale or transfer. The
purchaser’s or transferee’s notice may be made in conjunction with the seller’s
or transferor’s notice. If the purchaser or transferee fails to file the notice
as required herein, the purchaser or transferee shall be personally liable to
the City for the amount of taxes, interest and penalty owed by the seller or
transferor to the Finance Director up to the amount or fair market value of the
consideration paid by the purchaser or transferee. Upon the filing of a notice,
the Finance Director shall notify both the seller (or transferor) and the
purchaser (or transferee) of the amount to be withheld from the purchase or
transfer price to cover all taxes, interest and penalties due under this
chapter and unpaid up to the date of closing of the sale or transfer. The
purchaser or transferee shall withhold this amount from the purchase or
transfer price or, if payment of money or property is not involved, shall
withhold the performance that constitutes consideration for the sale or
transfer until the seller or transferor produces a receipt from the Finance
Director showing that such taxes, interest and penalty had been paid or a
certificate from the Finance Director showing no taxes are due. The purchaser
or transferee is relieved of any duty to withhold from the purchase or transfer
price and shall have no liability for taxes, interest or penalty due hereunder
from the seller or transferor if the Finance Director fails to notify the
purchaser or transferee of such amount claimed due at least five (5) days
before the date of such sale or transfer. If the purchaser or transferee is
notified by the Finance Director of the amount to be withheld from the purchase
or transfer price and does withhold such amount, the purchaserfs or
transfereefs liability for any taxes, interest or penalty hereunder shall be
limited to the amount to be withheld as set forth in the notification from the
Finance Director. If the purchaser or transferee fails to withhold from the
purchase or transfer price the amount requested by the Finance Director, the
purchaser or transferee shall be liable for any taxes, interest or penalty due
in excess of any amount withheld, but not exceeding the amount or fair market
value of the consideration paid upon such transfer. The purchaser or transferee
shall pay over to the Finance Director any amount withheld hereunder upon
notification of the refusal of the seller or transferor to pay any taxes,
interest or penalty due hereunder and upon notification of the Finance
Directorfs claim against the purchaser or transferee. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to relieve the seller or transferor of their liability for
taxes, interest and penalty except that any payments received from the
purchaser or transferee as provided herein shall reduce such liability payable
to the City.
(Ord. 21-174. Passed 11-8-21.)
   189.12 APPEALS.
   Any person dissatisfied with any ruling of the Finance Director which is
made under the authority conferred by this chapter or any rules or regulations
related thereto, may appeal therefrom to the Board of Review within thirty days
of the ruling or decision of the Finance Director, and the Board of Review
shall, on hearing, have jurisdiction to annul, affirm, reverse or modify any
such ruling or decision, or any part thereof, in accordance with the intent and
purpose of this chapter. Notice of appeal, in written form, shall be delivered,
or directed by certified mail, to the Finance Director of the City.
(Ord. 21-174. Passed 11-8-21.)

judicial order from a court of competent jurisdiction, or in the connection
with the performance of that person’s official duties or the official business

any information to any responsible party charged with liability under Section
189.10 for the purpose of monitoring and discharging their obligations there

to a taxpayer.
   (d)    Disclosure in the Course of Proceeding. The Finance Director may
disclose information in the course of any public proceeding or action to

   189.14  EFFECTIVE DATE.

or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this chapter and the

(Ord. 05-100. Passed 6-13-05.)
   191.14 CONTRACTOR AND SUBCONTRACTOR REGISTRATION.
   Contractors or Sub-contractors doing construction or other building work for
hire in the City must register with the Division of Taxation prior to the start
of construction or commencement of work. Contractors or Sub-contractors who are
licensed by the Division of Building shall be presumed to have met this
registration requirement. Other Contractors or Sub- contractors must complete
the required registration with the Division of Taxation. All Contractors must
maintain a current registration with the Division of Taxation to insure the
issuance of any required building permits by the Division of Building.
Registration shall include the Contractor or Sub-contractor’s name, address,
Social Security number and/or Taxpayer Identification number, and principal
place of business and, in the case of a Corporation, the name, address and
Taxpayer Identification number and the statutory agent. The Division of
Taxation shall issue a certificate of registration to Contractors and Sub-
contractors who register with the Division. Contractors shall be responsible
for the registration of all Sub-contractors working, operating or conducting
business at the direction or request of the Contractor. If the identity of the
Sub-contractor is unknown at the time of the initial registration of a
Contractor, such registration shall be permitted, upon compliance with all
other provisions herein. Upon determining the identity of any Sub- contractors
not known at the time of initial registration, the Contractor, as well as any
Sub- contractors, must, within 15 days of such identification, provide to the
Division of Taxation the information as required above. Failure to provide such
information within such 15-day period shall result in revocation of the
registration already made by and certificate already issued to the Contractor.
   Revocation shall also occur in the event of failure to file tax returns,
including withholding returns, failure to be current in the obligation to file
tax returns, including withholding returns, failure to withhold and/or pay any
taxes, interest or penalties owed to the City, failure to be current in the
obligation to pay any taxes, interest or penalties owed to the City, or for
other good cause articulated by the Division of Taxation. Otherwise, the
registration shall be valid indefinitely, but shall be amended within 15 days
of a change in any relevant information as set forth herein to be declared.
Failure to make such amendment shall result in the revocation of the
registration, subject to reregistration in compliance with this section.
(a)   Any fees for the above registration shall be set by the Division of
Taxation and shall bear a reasonable relation to the expense for services and/
or forms involved in such registration and the issuance of such certificate.
(b)   Persons, Pass-Through Entities or Corporations conducting transient and/
or temporary work within the City shall be subject to registration, but the
Division of Taxation is authorized to charge a reasonable blanket amount to
such Contractors and/or Sub-contractors to cover registration fees and any City
Income Taxes likely to be incurred in consequence of the work to be performed
in the City. However, this blanket amount shall not include the responsibility
and liability for Employees’ withholding taxes, which still shall be required
under this Chapter, unless the same has specifically been included in the
blanket amount. If such Taxpayer does not wish to pay the blanket amount
suggested by the Division of Taxation, the Taxpayer shall be charged a
registration fee as set forth herein, and shall be responsible for filing all
City Income Tax returns and paying all City Income Taxes, penalties and
interest under this Chapter.
(c)   Whoever fails, neglects or refuses to make the registration set forth in
this Section
191.14, to obtain the above-described certificate, and to keep the same
current, but nonetheless engages in construction and/or repair work within the
City shall be subject to fine or imprisonment, or both, pursuant to Section
191.99. Each day the violation is committed or is permitted to continue shall
constitute a separate offense.
(d)   The Division of Taxation may provide written notice ordering any Person,
Pass- Through Entity, or Corporation that is not in compliance with any
provision of this Section
191.14 to cease and desist construction and/or repair work within the City
until that Person, Pass-Through Entity, or Corporation complies with the
provisions of this Section
191.14. Until compliance is attained, an injunction and/or restraining order
may be granted by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon proper application of
the Division of Taxation, to prevent further violations of this Section
191.14 under penalty of law as set forth herein.
      (Ord. 05-100. Passed 6-13-05.)
   191.15  ANNUAL RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each Taxpayer having Taxable Income for a Taxable Year that could be
subject to the tax imposed by this Chapter, whether or not a tax is due

calendar year in the case of a Taxpayer using a calendar year for Federal
Income Tax purposes or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth
month after the end of the Fiscal Year in the case of a Taxpayer using a Fiscal
Year for Federal Income Tax purposes.
   (b)   The return shall be filed with the Administrator on a form or forms
furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Administrator, or on any form
that comports with Ohio R.C. 718.05(C) as a generic form, setting forth:
      (1)   The aggregate amounts of Compensation earned, and the gross income
from a Business less allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such
gross income to arrive at Net Profits. Only Compensation earned or received and
gross income earned during the Taxable Year, or portion thereof, covered by the
return and subject to the tax imposed by this Chapter shall be included on that
return.
      (2)   The amount of tax imposed by this Chapter on Compensation and Net
Profits, less any credits to which the taxpayer may be entitled under the
provisions of Sections
191.04,

      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns, or other

Profits of which are subject to tax under this Chapter may file its annual City
Income Tax return and the estimated City Income Tax Returns described in
Section
191.16 by using the Ohio business gateway.
   (c)   Extension of Time for Filing Returns. The Administrator may extend the
due date for filing the annual return upon the request of a Taxpayer, until the
last day of the month following the month to which an extension is granted by
the Internal Revenue Service for the filing of the Taxpayer’s Federal Income
Tax Return for the same Taxable Year. A Taxpayer shall request an extension of
the due date for filing an annual return by filing with the Administrator a
copy of the Taxpayer’s request for an extension of time to file the Taxpayer’s
Federal Income Tax Return for the same Taxable Year no later than the last day
prescribed by Section
191.16(a) for the filing of the annual return, or by filing a written request
by such date. For Taxable Years beginning on or after January 1, 2005, a
Taxpayer who is subject to City Income Tax on its Net Profits and who receives
an extension for filing the Federal Income Tax Return will receive an extension
for filing the City Income Tax Return for the same Taxable Year by filing a
notice of such extension through the Ohio business gateway in compliance with
Ohio R.C. 718.051(B), but such Taxpayer must pay any City Income Tax owed by
the unextended due date for filing the City Income Tax Return, as provided in
Section
191.15(a) and
191.16(h).
   A request to extend the due date for filing an annual return will be granted
automatically unless the Taxpayer:
(1)    Fails to timely file such request;
(2)    Fails to file a copy of the request for an extension of the due date for
filing the Taxpayer’s Federal Income Tax Return for the same Taxable Year;
(3)    Owes any delinquent City Income Tax, penalty, interest, assessment, or
other charge for the late payment or nonpayment of City Income Tax; or
(4)    Has failed to file any required City Income Tax return, report, or other
related document for a prior Taxable Year.
   The Administrator may require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of
the amount of tax shown to be due thereon, by the date the return is normally
due. A penalty shall not be assessed if the return is filed and the full amount
of tax shown on that return is paid on or before the extended due date.
Interest shall be charged on the unpaid balance at the rate of one-and-one-
half percent (1-1/2%) per month, computed monthly, for the period of the
extension, with any portion of a month to be charged as a full month.
   (d)   Owners of a Pass-Through Entity that is subject to the tax imposed by
this Chapter must file individual City Income Tax Returns and report thereon
their respective distributive shares of the profits or losses of the Pass-
Through Entity and pay the City Income Tax on the portion of the Pass-Through
Entity’s Net Profit that is subject to City Income Tax.
   (e)   If an individual who is Taxpayer is deceased, any City Income Tax
return required of such individual under this Chapter shall be made and filed
by the Fiduciary of his estate or other person charged with the property of
that decedent. City Income Tax returns required of an estate or trust shall be
made and filed by the Fiduciary thereof.
   (f)   Each return required to be filed under this Chapter shall be signed by
the Taxpayer or his duly authorized agent, and shall include the Taxpayer’s
Social Security number or Employer Identification number.
   (g)   Should the return, or the records of the Administrator, indicate an
overpayment of the tax to which the City is entitled under the provisions of
this Chapter, such overpayment shall first be applied against any existing
liability, including penalties and interest, of the Taxpayer to the City, and
the balance, if any, at the election of the Taxpayer communicated to the
Administrator, shall be refunded or transferred against any subsequent
liability of the Taxpayer to the City.
   (h)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Sections
191.04 and
191.11. Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Administrator. A Taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of Net Profits after the due date for filing the original return.
   Within 30 days from the final determination of any Federal or State Income
Tax liability affecting the Taxpayer’s City Income Tax liability, the Taxpayer
shall make and file an amended City Income Tax Return, showing income subject
to City Income Tax based upon such final determination of Federal or State
Income Tax liability, and pay any additional City Income Tax shown due thereon
or make claim for refund of any overpayment.

the end of the Taxable Year for which such declaration or amended declaration
was filed, an annual return shall be filed, and any balance that may be due to
the City shall be paid therewith in accordance with the provisions of Section
191.15. Any Taxpayer, however, may file an annual return on or before the last
day of the first month following the end of the Taxable Year for which such

shall be subject to the interest and penalty provisions of Section
191.12. No penalty, interest, interest penalty, or other similar assessment or
charge, however, shall be imposed against a Taxpayer for the late payment or
nonpayment of estimated City Income Tax in either of the following

Income Tax liability for the preceding Taxable Year as shown on the return
filed by the Taxpayer for the preceding Taxable Year, provided that the return
for the preceding Taxable Year reflected a 12-month period and the Taxpayer
filed a return for the preceding Taxable Year.

   191.17 WITHHOLDING BY EMPLOYER - COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each Employer within or doing Business in the City who or that employs
one or more Persons shall, at the time of payment of Compensation, deduct the
City Income Tax at the applicable rate then in effect from the gross
Compensation earned or received by Residents, regardless of where such
Compensation was earned or received, and shall deduct that City Income Tax from
the Compensation earned or received from work done or services performed or
rendered in the City by Nonresidents. Over the road drivers reporting to a
terminal located in the City shall have a minimum of ten percent (10%) of their
Compensation allocated to the City on which City Income Tax shall be deducted.
   (b)   Each Employer subject to the provisions of this Section
191.17 shall, on or before the last day of the month, make a return and remit
to the City the City Income Tax withheld in the previous month. Such return
shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Administrator
and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed therefor by the
Administrator. Such Employer shall be liable for the payment of City Income Tax
required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such Tax has in fact been
withheld. If the amount of the City Income Tax so deducted by an Employer in
any one month is less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), however, the Employer
may defer the filing of a return and payment of the amount deducted for that
month and the following one or two months in that calendar quarter until the
last day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter in which that
month occurs.
   (c)   On or before each January 31, each Employer subject to the provisions
of this Section
191.17 shall file with the Administrator an annual reconciliation return for
the prior calendar year along with an information return for each Employee from
whom City Income Tax has been, or should have been, withheld for the prior
calendar year showing the name, address and Social Security number of the
Employee, the total amount of Compensation paid during the year to such
Employee and the amount of City Income Tax withheld from the Compensation of
such Employee and shall provide a copy of such information return to the
Employee. The information return shall include all of the information required
to be reported by the Employer to the Internal Revenue Service on a Form W-2.
At the time of filing the annual reconciliation return, the Employer shall pay
over any amounts deducted or that should have been deducted during the
preceding calendar year but that were not previously remitted. The annual
reconciliation form shall be obtained from the Tax Administrator. Failure to
comply with this subsection (d) may result in the disallowance of all or part
of the deduction for Compensation taken by the Employer for City Income Tax
purposes.
   (d)   In collecting City Income Tax, the Employer shall be deemed to hold
the same as a trustee for the benefit of the City until such Employer makes
payment to the City, and such Tax collected by such Employer from its Employees
shall be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such Employer until paid to the
City.
   (e)   On or before each January 31, any Person who contracts or otherwise
engages another Person to perform services or conduct Business for remuneration
in any form, including, but not limited to, the sale of real estate, the sale
of insurance, construction, transportation, or other contract or subcontract
services, shall file with the Administrator an information return on a form
prescribed by the Administrator, which shall include the proper name, address,
federal identification number and the amount of such remuneration paid during
the prior calendar year to such Person. Failure to provide the foregoing
information may result in the disallowance of any deduction claimed by the
Taxpayer in respect of payments made to another Person under contract or other
engagement for the performance of services or conduct of Business.
   (f)   On or before each January 31 and each July 31, any Person engaged in
the rental of real estate that receives Rental Income, as described in Section
191.02(ff), shall file with the Administrator a list of tenants as of December
31 and June 30, respectively, including the name and address of each tenant.
   (g)   Any return or form required to be filed under this Section
191.17 is considered filed on the date postmarked by the United States Post
Office or on the date delivered other than by the United States Postal Service
during normal business hours to the Division of Taxation.
   (h)   If City Income tax is withheld as required under this Section
191.17 and is not paid over to the City, the officer, Employee or Owner
(“Responsible Person”) of an Employer having control of or supervision of, or
charged with the responsibility of, making the payment of the withheld City
Income tax as required under this Section
191.17, shall be personally liable for failure to pay such tax, and penalty and
interest. The dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization  of any such Employer
required to file the return and pay the tax described in this Section
191.17 does not discharge a Responsible Person’s liability for a prior failure
of such Employer to pay such tax, and penalty and interest due thereon.
   (i)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2007, any Employer
subject to this Section
191.17 may use the Ohio business gateway both to report the amount of City
Income Tax withheld from Compensation and to remit such amounts.
(Ord. 05-100. Passed 6-13-05.)
   191.18 SEPARABILITY.
   If any sentence, clause, section or part of this Chapter or any tax against
any individual or any of several groups specified herein is found to be
unconstitutional, illegal, or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality, or
invalidity shall affect only such clause, sentence, section, or part of this
Chapter and shall not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions,
sentences, clauses, sections, or other parts of this Chapter. It is hereby
declared to be the intention of the City Commission that this Chapter would
have been adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal, or invalid sentence,
clause, section, or part thereof not been included herein.
(Ord. 05-100. Passed 6-13-05.)
   191.19 COLLECTION OF TAX AFTER TERMINATION OF CHAPTER.
   (a)   This Chapter shall continue effective insofar as the levy of taxes is
concerned until revoked, and insofar as the collection of taxes levied
hereunder and actions or proceedings for collecting any tax so levied or
enforcing any provisions of this Chapter are concerned, it shall continue
effective until all of such taxes levied in the aforesaid period are fully paid
and any and all suits and prosecutions for the collection of such taxes or for
the punishment of violations of this Chapter have been fully terminated.
   (b)   Returns due for all or any part of the last effective year of this
Chapter shall be due on the dates provided in Sections
191.15 and
191.17 as though this Chapter were continuing.
(Ord. 05-100. Passed 6-13-05.)
   191.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Any Taxpayer who violates any of the provisions of this Chapter shall
be subject to prosecution for such violation and, upon conviction for such
violation, shall be guilty of a first degree misdemeanor. All prosecutions
under this section must be commenced within the time specified in Ohio R.C.
718.12(B).
   (b)   If any other prior ordinance or resolution regarding City Income Tax

      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (F)(2) and (G) of this
section, net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same

         (a)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession

         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever

         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City
to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period

      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
City may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of
the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one
or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
192.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section

         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or

a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            (iii)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person
described in (F)(3)(a)(ii) of this section, or a related member of such a
vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
            (Ord. 18-074. Passed 3-26-18.)
      (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and except
as provided in division (G) of this section, receipts from sales and rentals
made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal corporation as
follows: (Ord. 23-213. Passed 11-13-23.)
         (a)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property
shall be sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where
title passes, the property meets either of the following criteria:
            (i)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from
a stock of goods located within the City.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
               (Ord. 18-074. Passed 3-26-18.)
         (b)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to
the City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
         (c)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
         (d)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
         (e)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City's tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the City or if the individual
taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the City. The City shall
allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate accounting for the purpose of
calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
      (6)   (a)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker
relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported

applicable, based upon the ratio of the commissions the agent or broker
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate located in the City
to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the City shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the City. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such a credit is allowed under the City's income tax ordinance.
When calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1) of this section for
the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
      (7)    Left intentionally blank.
      (8)    Intentionally left blank.
         (Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)
   (G)   (1)    As used in this division:
         (a)    "Qualifying remote employee or owner" means an individual who
is an employee of a taxpayer or who is a partner or member holding an ownership
interest in a taxpayer that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes, provided that the individual meets both of the following criteria:
            (i)    The taxpayer has assigned the individual to a qualifying
reporting location.
            (ii)    The individual is permitted or required to perform services
for the taxpayer at a qualifying remote work location.
         (b)    "Qualifying remote work location" means a permanent or
temporary location at which an employee or owner chooses or is required to
perform services for the taxpayer, other than a reporting location of the
taxpayer or any other location owned or controlled by a customer or client of
the taxpayer. "Qualifying remote work location" may include the residence of an
employee or owner and may be located outside of a municipal corporation that
imposes an income tax in accordance with this chapter. An employee or owner may
have more than one qualifying remote work location during a taxable year.
         (c)    "Reporting location" means either of the following:
            (i)    A permanent or temporary place of doing business, such as an
office, warehouse, storefront, construction site, or similar location, that is
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the taxpayer;
            (ii)    Any location in this state owned or controlled by a
customer or client of the taxpayer, provided that the taxpayer is required to
withhold taxes under Section 4 of this Chapter, on qualifying wages paid to an
employee for the performance of personal services at that location.
         (d)    "Qualifying reporting location" means one of the following:
            (i)    The reporting location in this state at which an employee or
owner performs services for the taxpayer on a regular or periodic basis during
the taxable year;
            (ii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) of this section, the reporting
location in this state at which the employee's or owner's supervisor regularly
or periodically reports during the taxable year;
            (iii)    If no reporting location exists in this state for an
employee or owner under division (G)(1)(d)(i) or (ii) of this section, the
location that the taxpayer otherwise assigns as the employee's or owner's
qualifying reporting location, provided the assignment is made in good faith
and is recorded and maintained in the taxpayer's business records. A taxpayer
may change the qualifying reporting location designated for an employee or
owner under this division at any time.
      (2)    For tax years ending on or after December 31, 2023, a taxpayer may
elect to apply the provisions of this division to the apportionment of its net
profit from a business or profession. For taxpayers that make this election,
the provisions of division (F) of this section apply to such apportionment
except as otherwise provided in this division.
A taxpayer shall make the election allowed under this division in writing on or
with the taxpayer's net profit return or, if applicable, a timely filed amended
net profit return or a timely filed appeal of an assessment. The election
applies to the taxable year for which that return or appeal is filed and for
all subsequent taxable years, until the taxpayer revokes the election.
The taxpayer shall make the initial election with the tax administrator of each
municipal corporation with which, after applying the apportionment provisions
authorized in this division, the taxpayer is required to file a net profit tax
return for that taxable year. A taxpayer shall not be required to notify the
tax administrator of a municipal corporation in which a qualifying remote
employee's or owner's qualifying remote work location is located, unless the
taxpayer is otherwise required to file a net profit return with that municipal
corporation due to business operations that are unrelated to the employee's or
owner's activity at the qualifying remote work location.
After the taxpayer makes the initial election, the election applies to every
municipal corporation in which the taxpayer conducts business. The taxpayer
shall not be required to file a net profit return with a municipal corporation
solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying remote work
location is located in such municipal corporation.
Nothing in this division prohibits a taxpayer from making a new election under
this division after properly revoking a prior election.
(3)    For the purpose of calculating the ratios described in division (F)(1)
of this section, all of the following apply to a taxpayer that has made the
election described in division (G)(2):
         (a)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(a) of this section, the
average original cost of any tangible personal property used by a qualifying
remote employee or owner at that individual's qualifying remote work location
shall be sitused to that individual's qualifying reporting location.
         (b)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(b) of this section, any
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable period to a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
         (c)    For the purpose of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, and
notwithstanding division (F)(4) of this section, any gross receipts of the
business or profession from services performed during the taxable period by a
qualifying remote employee or owner for services performed at that individual's
qualifying remote work location shall be sitused to that individual's
qualifying reporting location.
      (4)    Nothing in this division prevents a taxpayer from requesting, or a
tax administrator from requiring, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or
a portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method as
described in division (F)(2) of this section. However, a tax administrator
shall not require an alternative apportionment method in such a manner that it
would require a taxpayer to file a net profit return with a municipal
corporation solely because a qualifying remote employee's or owner's qualifying
remote work location is located in that municipal corporation.
      (5)    Except as otherwise provided in this division, nothing in this
division is intended to affect the withholding of taxes on qualifying wages
pursuant to Section 4 of this Chapter.
         (Ord. 23-213. Passed 11-13-23.)
   192.04 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.   
Withholding provisions.
   (A)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in City shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages earned
and/or received by each employee in the City. Except for qualifying wages for
which withholding is not required under Section
192.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
192.03 of this Chapter, of 1.25%. An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively
pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit
of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City in the preceding calendar year exceeded $2,399, or if the
total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the City in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded $200.
   Payment under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for which
the tax was withheld.
         (b)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day of each
calendar quarter.
         (c)    Intentionally left blank.
      (2)    If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. The payment of tax by
electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an employer's,
agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required under this
section.
      (3)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the City as the return
required of an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under
this Chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent
of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this Chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to City
income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the deferred
compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the deferred
compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         (a)    The names, addresses, and social security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City during the preceding calendar year;
         (b)    The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee,
the total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (c)    The name of every other municipal corporation for which tax was
withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         (d)    Any other information required for federal income tax reporting
purposes on Internal Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with
respect to such employee;
         (e)    Other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold City income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)    The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this Chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section. (Ord. 18-023. Passed 1-22-18.)

If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent the
"greatest number of days in a calendar year" performing services for or on
behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends a
particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)(b) of

section, an employer is not required to withhold City income tax on qualifying
wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in the City
if the employee performed such services in the City on 20 or fewer days in a
calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            (i)    The employee's principal place of work is located in the
City.
            (ii)    The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the City. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
City at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than 20 days in a
calendar year. Services can "reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than 20 days" if either of the following applies at the time the services
commence:
               (a)    The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of the services to complete the services;
               (b)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to

in Section
192.04.
            (iv)    The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            (i)    Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            (ii)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was
performing services for the employer to any other location;
            (iii)    Traveling from any location to another location in order

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in the City exceeds the 20-day threshold, the employer shall
withhold and remit tax to the City for any subsequent days in that calendar
year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for personal
services performed in the City.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City
under division (C)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax for the City
for the first 20 days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the City.
      (5)    If an employer's fixed location is the City and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
192.02, the employer shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the City.
To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a taxable
year, a the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
192.04.

   192.05 ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)    An annual City income tax return shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon. (Ord. 23-213. Passed 11-13-23.)
      (1)    The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
192.04 of this Chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the City.
      (2)    Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for City income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal Taxable Income taxable to the City, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
Chapter.
   (B)    If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (C)    If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City, the return or notice required of that individual shall be
completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (D)    Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.
   (E)    The City shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (F)   (1)    Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's social security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)    The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an
individual to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of
the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-
2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the
taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any
municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or in
the case of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation,
Ohio form IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other
documentation necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return.
An individual taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section
electronically is not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies
after the return has been filed.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit return
electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner shall
either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax Administrator
at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available, submit the
documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (Ord. 18-023. Passed 1-22-18.)
   (G)   (1)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Section 5747.08 of the ORC. The taxpayer shall complete and file the
return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic
forms, together with remittance made payable to City. No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
         (b)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day (15th) of the fourth month following the end of
the taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the City. No remittance is required if
the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
         (2)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City’s income tax
return. The extended due date of the City’s income tax return shall be the 15th
day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to which the
return relates. For tax years ending on or after January 1, 2023, the extended
due date of the City’s income tax return for a taxpayer that is not an
individual shall be the 15th day of the eleventh month after the last day of
the taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file
under this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)    A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City's income tax return.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's City income tax return. If the
request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
      (3)    If the tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the
City's income tax return. The extended due date of the City's income tax return
shall be the same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
      (4)    If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)   If a taxpayer receives an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return under division (G)(2), (3), or (4) of this section, the tax
administrator shall not make any inquiry or send any notice to the taxpayer
with regard to the return on or before the date the taxpayer files the return
or on or before the extended due date to file the return, whichever occurs
first. If a tax administrator violates division (G)(5) of this section, the
municipal corporation shall reimburse the taxpayer for any reasonable costs
incurred to respond to such inquiry or notice, up to $150. Division (G)(5) of
this section does not apply to an extension received under division (G)(2) of
this section if the tax administrator has actual knowledge that the taxpayer
failed to file for a federal extension as required to receive the extension
under division (G)(2) of this section or failed to file for an extension under
division (G)(2)(b) of this section.
      (6)    To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
         (Ord. 23-213. Passed 11-13-23.)
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a taxable
year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the City an
annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this section, unless the
provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)    A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to City income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)    The person was required to file a tax return with City for
the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed services at
a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)(g)) within City.
            (ii)    The person no longer provides services in City and does not
expect to be subject to City income tax for the taxable year.
         (b)    The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within City. The affidavit shall also include the
following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
City, make any sales in City, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
City during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the tax
levied by City for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with City income tax ordinance
and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty
of perjury.
         (c)    If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)
(b) the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return
for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)    Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
192.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (K)    Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter
and of the City's ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents. (Ord. 18-023. Passed 1-22-18.)
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (M)   (1)    Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the City's
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)    Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the City before the 181st day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates.
      (3)    Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the City in accordance with this
Chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this
section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the
taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this division,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the president of the
United States or an act of the congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (P)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (Q)    For each taxable year to which division (N), (O), or (P) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (O)(2) and (3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (R)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
Section 4927.01 of the ORC.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
Section 5727.01 of the ORC.
         (Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)
   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City's
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section 718.80 of
the Revised Code, a valid election made by a taxpayer under division (S)(1) or
(2) of this section is binding upon the tax commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election is made under section 718.80 of the Revised Code
is terminated, a valid election made under section 718.86 of the Revised Code
is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the five-year
period. (Ord. 18-074. Passed 3-26-18.)
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the City. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (U)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City income tax return in the
same manner as is required under the United States department of treasury
regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated
federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (V)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (V)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in Section
192.02, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
192.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return
shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net
profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
192.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
192.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not
be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
192.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
City;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this Chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of Section
192.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this Chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

(Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)
   192.07 ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the City's income tax for the
current taxable year.
      (2)    "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the City for the

the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)    Taxes withheld for the City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         (b)    An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
"date of the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)    Taxpayers filing joint returns shall file joint declarations of
estimated taxes. A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by
the Tax Administrator. A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than twelve

Administrator.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the

(G) of Section
192.05 or on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a
declaration on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the
beginning of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)    The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as

the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half (22.5) percent of
the tax liability for the taxable year;

shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)    On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the
year following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed,
an annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with Section
192.05.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
192.18 upon the amount of underpayment for the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (E) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
percent (45%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half percent (67.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety
percent (90%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the City under Section
192.05 for that year.
      (3)    The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 18-023. Passed 1-22-18.)
   192.08 ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS. 
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this Chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped. If a person chooses
to round amounts entered on a document, the person shall round all amounts
entered on the document.
(Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)
   192.09 REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
192.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the City:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
192.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
192.18 (A)(4).
(Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)
   192.10 SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR
REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have
been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund
but is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by the City. If the
City's tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (C)    If the City's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City's tax rate. However, if the City's tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)
   192.11 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or
state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City. The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
192.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall claim
refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in Section
192.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City's tax liability, that taxpayer
shall make and file an amended City return showing income subject to City
income tax based upon such final determination of federal or state tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)
   192.12 LIMITATIONS. 
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
192.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
192.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, or the Ohio board
of tax appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
192.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
192.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover the City income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)
   192.13 AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. (Ord. 15-165.
Passed 11-23-15.)
   192.14 SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the receipt of
service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division
(C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and
that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
"This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable law
ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator as
shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the mailing
of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the assessment was
completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the assessment by ordinary
mail and that the assessment was served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City official,
or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the local
board of tax review.
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)
   192.15 ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City that arises pursuant to the City's income tax imposed in accordance
with this Chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this Chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the City:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)
   192.16 TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this Chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of City as authorized
by this Chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may furnish copies
of returns filed or otherwise received under this Chapter and other related tax
information to the internal revenue service, the tax commissioner, and tax
administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)
   192.17 FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by City ordinance or state law to be
filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise the
preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement, claim,
or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the City or the Tax Administrator.

         (b)    Income tax, estimated income tax, and withholding tax required
to be paid or remitted to the City on or after January 1, 2016.
      (2)    This section does not apply to returns required to be filed or
payments required to be made before January 1, 2016, regardless of the filing
or payment date. Returns required to be filed or payments required to be made
before January 1, 2016, but filed or paid after that date shall be subject to
the ordinances or rules and regulations, as adopted before January 1, 2016, of
the City to which the return is to be filed or the payment is to be made.
   (C)    Should any taxpayer, employer, agent of the employer, or other payer

memorandums, and federal and state income tax returns, to examine persons under
oath, to issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts,
papers, records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a
court for attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the
fees of officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         (b)    The powers referred to in this division of this section shall

of the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the City's
income tax Chapter;
      (2)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)    Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)    Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax

provided in this Chapter;
      (5)    Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to

         (b)    If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Tax Review or

determine, or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order
which the Tax Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is
withdrawn by the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)    Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)    Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the

thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
federal and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
      (2)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is
subject to, the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax
Administrator's inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a
period of six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records
or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to
their destruction within that period, or by order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to
show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability,
for the income tax levied by the City or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator
compelling attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal or state income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)    If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this Chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
192.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
192.99.
         (b)    If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (C) of Section
192.19 within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this Chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
192.18.
         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
192.99 for a violation of Section
192.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
            (Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)

Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (C)    A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (D)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.

   (F)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.
(Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)

   (A)   (1)    The Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. Two
members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the City, but such
appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
City at any time during their term or in the five years (which applies only to
these two appointments) immediately preceding the date of appointment. One
member shall be appointed by the City Manager of the City. This member may be
an employee of the City, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent
officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee
directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)    The term for members of the Board of Tax Review of City shall be

the member is reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member
appointed by the City Manager of the City shall serve at the discretion of the
administrative official.
      (3)    Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
            (4)    A member of the Board of Tax Review who, for any reason,
ceases to meet the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section
shall resign immediately by operation of law.
      (5)    A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Tax Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Tax Review.
      (6)    If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Tax
Review due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Tax
Review in the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be
subject to the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the
appointment of the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the Board of Tax Review by filing a request with the Board of Tax
Review. The request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons
why the assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed
within 60 days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within 60
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Tax Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Tax Review
may allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In
such a case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day
of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15
days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax

provided in Section 5717.011 of the ORC.
   (F)    The Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt
rules governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions.
Such records are not public records available for inspection under Section
149.43 of the ORC. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Tax
Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of a public body
subject to Section 121.22 of the ORC.

   192.22 AUTHORITY TO CREATE RULES AND REGULATIONS.

(Ord. 15-165. Passed 11-23-15.)
   192.27 CONTRACTOR AND SUBCONTRACTOR REGISTRATION.
   Contractors or Sub-contractors doing construction or other building work for
hire in the City must register with the Division of Taxation prior to the start
of construction or commencement of work. Contractors or Sub-contractors who are
licensed by the Division of Building shall be presumed to have met this
registration requirement. Other Contractors or Sub-contractors must complete
the required registration with the Division of Taxation. All Contractors must
maintain a current registration with the Division of Taxation to insure the
issuance of any required building permits by the Division of Building.
Registration shall include the Contractor or Sub-contractor's name, address,
Social Security number and/or Taxpayer Identification number, and principal
place of business and, in the case of a Corporation, the name, address and
Taxpayer Identification number and the statutory agent. The Division of

contractors who register with the Division. Contractors shall be responsible
for the registration of all Sub-contractors working, operating or conducting
business at the direction or request of the Contractor. If the identity of the
Sub-contractor is unknown at the time of the initial registration of a
Contractor, such registration shall be permitted, upon compliance with all
other provisions herein. Upon determining the identity of any Sub-contractors
not known at the time of initial registration, the Contractor, as well as any
Sub- contractors, must, within 15 days of such identification, provide to the
Division of Taxation the information as required above. Failure to provide such
information within such 15-day period shall result in revocation of the
registration already made by and certificate already issued to the Contractor.
   Revocation shall also occur in the event of failure to file tax returns,
including withholding returns, failure to be current in the obligation to file
tax returns, including withholding returns, failure to withhold and/or pay any
taxes, interest or penalties owed to the City, failure to be current in the
obligation to pay any taxes, interest or penalties owed to the City, or for
other good cause articulated by the Division of Taxation. Otherwise, the
registration shall be valid indefinitely, but shall be amended within 15 days
of a change in any relevant information as set forth herein to be declared.
Failure to make such amendment shall result in the revocation of the
registration, subject to reregistration in compliance with this section.
   (A)    Any fees for the above registration shall be set by the Division of
Taxation and shall bear a reasonable relation to the expense for services and/
or forms involved in such registration and the issuance of such certificate.
   (B)    Persons, Pass-Through Entities or Corporations conducting transient
and/or temporary work within the City shall be subject to registration, but the
Division of Taxation is authorized to charge a reasonable blanket amount to
such Contractors and/or Sub-contractors to cover registration fees and any City
Income Taxes likely to be incurred in consequence of the work to be performed
in the City. However, this blanket amount shall not include the responsibility
and liability for Employees' withholding taxes, which still shall be required
under this Chapter, unless the same has specifically been included in the
blanket amount. If such Taxpayer does not wish to pay the blanket amount
suggested by the Division of Taxation, the Taxpayer shall be charged a
registration fee as set forth herein, and shall be responsible for filing all
City Income Tax returns and paying all City Income Taxes, penalties and
interest under this Chapter.
   (C)    Whoever fails, neglects or refuses to make the registration set forth
in this Section, to obtain the above-described certificate, and to keep the
same current, but nonetheless engages in construction and/or repair work within
the City shall be subject to fine or imprisonment, or both, pursuant to Section
192.99. Each day the violation is committed or is permitted to continue shall
constitute a separate offense.
   (D)    The Division of Taxation may provide written notice ordering any
Person, Pass-Through Entity, or Corporation that is not in compliance with any
provision of this Section to cease and desist construction and/or repair work
within the City until that Person, Pass-Through Entity, or Corporation complies
with the provisions of this Section. Until compliance is attained, an
injunction and/or restraining order may be granted by a court of competent
jurisdiction, upon proper application of the Division of Taxation, to prevent
further violations of this Section under penalty of law as set forth herein.

entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of the Revised Code.
"Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when

   193.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the
following meanings ascribed to them respectively.
   (a)    "Hotel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained, advertised,
or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping accommodations are
offered for a consideration to guests, in which 5 or more rooms are used for
the accommodation of guests, whether the rooms are in one or several
structures. The immediately preceding sentence notwithstanding, "hotel" also
means an
      (1)    Establishment or dwelling in which fewer than five rooms are used
for the accommodation of guests or
      (2)    An establishment or dwelling at which rooms are used for the
accommodation of guests regardless of whether each room is accessible through
the same keyed entry; and, in determining the number of rooms, all rooms are
included regardless of the number of structures in which the rooms are situated
or the number of parcels of land on which the structures are located if the
structures are under the same ownership and the structures are not identified
in advertisements of the accommodations as distinct establishments. For this
purpose, two or more structures are under the same ownership if they are owned
by the same person, or if they are owned by two or more persons the majority of
the ownership interests of which are owned by the same person.
   (b)   "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or
possession of any room or rooms, or space or portion thereof, in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes. The use or possession or right to use
or possess any room or any suite of connecting rooms as office space, banquet,
or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample, or display space shall to be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition, unless the person
exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess, all
or any portion of the room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping
purposes.
   (c)   "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in
the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other
capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of
any type or character, other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be
deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter, and shall have the same
duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this
chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be
considered to be compliance by both.
   (d)   "Person" means any individual, firm, limited liability company,
partnership, company, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal
organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust,
receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit
as a business entity.
   (e)   "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in money,
whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits,
and property or services of any kind or nature, and also any amount for which
the occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom
whatsoever.

   193.02  RATE OF TAX.
   (a)   Commencing on January 1, 1978, for the purpose of providing revenue
with which to meet the needs of the City for general operating expenses, there
is levied a tax of 3% on all rents charged to transient guests.
   (b)   This tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City,
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City. The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the
hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guest ceasing to occupy space in the hotel.
If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the
Finance Director may require that the tax be paid directly to the Finance
Director. (Ord. 18-108. Passed 5-29-18.)

the rent, and shown separately on any record thereof, at the time when the
occupancy is arranged or contracted and charged for, and upon every evidence of
occupancy, or any bill or statement or charge made for an occupancy issued or
delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the guest to the
operator as trustee for and on account of the city, and the operator shall be
liable for the collection thereof and for the remittance of the tax to the
City.
   (b)   No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether
directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or
absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if
added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided.
(Ord. 18-108. Passed 5-29-18.)
   193.05 REGISTRATION.
   Within 30 days after the effective date of this chapter, or within 30 days

to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The
certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
   (a)   The name of the operator;
   (b)   The address of the hotel:
   (c)   The date upon which the certificate was issued;

person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the transient
occupancy tax chapter by registering with the Finance Director for the purpose
of collecting from transient guests the transient occupancy tax and remitting

which may be established by the Finance Director, make a return to the Finance
Director, on forms provided by the City, or submit an online return through the

return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the
Finance Director or through the Erie County Auditor’s Localgov tax software.
The Finance Director may establish shorter reporting periods for any
certificate holder if he/she deems it necessary in order to ensure collection
of the tax, and he/she may require further information in the return if the
information is pertinent to the collection of the tax. Returns and payments are
due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected
by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of
the City until payment thereof is made to the City. All returns and payments
submitted by each operator shall be treated as confidential by the Finance
Director, and shall not be released except upon order of a court of competent

or interest, or both.

FINANCE DIRECTOR.
   If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and to make, within
the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax, or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Finance Director shall proceed in
such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Finance Director shall procure
such facts and information upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed
by this chapter, and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to
collect the same and to make a report and remittance, he shall proceed to
determine and assess against the operator the tax, interest, and penalties
provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Finance
Director shall give notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally,
or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to
the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. The operator may
within 10 days after the serving or mailing of the notice make application in
writing to the Finance Director for a hearing on the amount assessed. If an
application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time
prescribed, the tax, interest, and penalties, if any, determined by the Finance
Director, shall become final and conclusive, and immediately due and payable.
If an application is made, the Finance Director shall give not less than 5 days
written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at
a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should
not be fixed for the tax, interest, and penalties. At the hearing, the operator
may appear and offer evidence why the specified tax, interest, and penalties
should be so fixed. After the hearing, the Finance Director shall determine the
proper tax to be remitted, and shall give written notice to the person in the
manner prescribed herein of the determination and the amount of the tax,
interest, and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after
15 days, unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section

Board of Review by filing a notice of appeal with the Finance Director within
15 days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Board of
Review shall fix a time and place for hearing the appeal, and shall give notice
in writing to the operator at his last known place of address. The findings of
the Board of Review shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed
above for service of a notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be

reasonable times. (Ord. 18-108. Passed 5-29-18.)

therefor, stating, under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds upon which
the claim is founded, is filed with the Finance Director within 3 years of the
date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Finance Director.
   (b)   An operator may claim a refund or take as a credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously
or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner
prescribed by the Finance Director that the person from whom the tax has been
collected was not a transient guest; provided, however, that neither a refund
nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has
either been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently
payable by the transient to the operator.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, or paid more
than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City, by
filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only when
the tax was paid by the transient guest directly to the Finance Director, or

      (a)    A tax of eight percent (8%) on the admission charge for each
individual who is admitted to any place in the City. The tax is levied and
imposed irrespective of who pays the admissions charge or when the admissions
charge is paid. The tax shall apply to every admission within the City for
which a charge is made, notwithstanding that the sale of the ticket or other
evidence or right of admission thereto is made outside the City. Where the tax

control the sale of admissions to the event or where talent, services, or other
items are compensated for on a percentage basis if the percentage results in

services, or other items.
(Ord. 21-175. Passed 11-8-21.)
   195.05 COLLECTION OF TAX.
   (a)    Every person receiving any payment on which a tax is levied under

195.03 from the person making the admission payment. The tax required to be
collected under this chapter shall be deemed to be held in trust for the
benefit of the City and deemed to be trust funds in the hands of the person
required to collect the tax until all such tax collected is paid to the City as
herein provided. Any person required to collect the tax imposed under this
chapter who fails, refuses or neglects to collect the tax, or having collected
the tax, fails, refuses or neglects to remit the tax to the Finance Director in
the manner prescribed by this chapter and the Rules and Regulations, whether
such failure, refusal or neglect is the result of their own act or the result
of acts or conditions beyond their control, shall nevertheless be personally
liable to the City for the amount of such tax, whether or not such tax has been
collected.
   (b)   (1)    The tax imposed by this chapter shall be collected at the time
the admission charge is paid by the person seeking admission to any place and
shall be reported and remitted by the person receiving the tax to the Finance
Director monthly and remittances therefor are due on or before the twenty-fifth
(25th) day of the month succeeding the end of the monthly period in which the
tax is collected or received. The person receiving any payment for admissions
shall make out a return upon such forms prescribed by or acceptable to the
Finance Director and set forth such information as the Finance Director may
require, showing the amount of the tax collected upon admissions for which he
or she is liable for the preceding monthly period, and shall sign and transmit
the same to the Finance Director with a remittance for the amount of tax due.
Failure to receive or procure any form prescribed by the Finance Director shall
not excuse any person from timely filing the return due or from paying any
admissions tax due.
      (2)    The Finance Director may in their discretion require verified
annual returns from any person receiving admission payments setting forth such
additional information as he or she may deem necessary to determine correctly
the amount of tax collected and payable. Whenever any theater, circus, show,
exhibition, entertainment or amusement makes an admission charge which is
subject to the tax herein levied, and the same is of a temporary or transitory
nature, of which the Finance Director shall be the judge, the Finance Director
may require the report and remittance of the tax immediately upon the
collection of the tax, at the conclusion of the performance or exhibition, or
at the conclusion of the series of performances or exhibitions or at such other
times as the Finance Director shall determine. Failure to comply with any

timely payment of taxes shall be subject to a late payment penalty, unless a
late filing penalty is due as provided in division (c) below, equal to ten
percent (10%) of the taxes not paid timely.
   (c)    In addition to any interest charges, any person who fails to file a
remittance return when due shall be subject to a late filing penalty equal to
ten percent (10%) of the taxes reported, or that should have been reported, on
the return that is not filed timely.
   (d)    Any payment or return shall be considered paid or filed,
respectively, on the date such payment or return is physically received by the
Finance Director.
   (e)    All payments received shall first be applied to penalty due, then
interest due and finally the taxes due for the period for which the payment is
made.
   (f)    The Finance Director may abate all or any portion of the penalty
imposed for late payment or late filing if the Finance Director determines that
such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.
(Ord. 21-175. Passed 11-8-21.)
   195.07  RECORD KEEPING; AUDITS.

shall be retained by each operator for a period of six (6) years subsequent to
the year of transaction.
   (c)    Access to Records. Each operator shall afford the Finance Director
and their designated agents access to all such records and evidence at all
reasonable times and shall provide verification or authentication of the same,
as the Finance Director may require. The Finance Director and their agents are
hereby authorized to examine the books, papers and records of any person
responsible for the collection and remittance of the tax in order to verify the
accuracy of any return made, or, if no return has been made, to determine the
taxes due. Every person responsible for the collection and remittance of tax
herein imposed is hereby required and directed to provide to the Finance
Director and their designated agents the means, facilities and opportunity to
conduct any examinations or investigations as are hereby authorized.
   (d)    Audits. The Finance Director shall have, at reasonable times during
normal business hours, the right to examination and audit of all account books
and records of any person responsible for the collection and remittance of the
tax herein imposed and levied which, in the Finance Directorfs opinion, in any
way pertain to admissions charges, admissions, or relevant transactions. This
audit is to be made by the Finance Director or by accountants employed by the
City and at its own expense. If required by the Finance Director, a complete
audit of a person’s gross receipts from admissions or relevant transactions
shall be provided at the end of each person’s fiscal year by an accountant
approved by the Finance Director and at the expense of the City.
Notwithstanding the foregoing if, as the result of an audit, the Finance
Director shall determine that there shall be an unpaid tax liability for a
person equal to or greater than one percent (1%) of the person’s total
liability for the period audited, the Finance Director may require such person
to pay the expenses of the audit.
(Ord. 21-175. Passed 11-8-21.)
   195.08  RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   The Finance Director is hereby empowered to adopt, promulgate, and to
enforce rules and regulations not inconsistent with the terms of this chapter
relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the administration and
enforcement of the provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to,
provisions relating to recordkeeping. A copy of the rules and regulations shall

request. Failure or refusal to comply with any rules and regulations shall be
deemed a violation of this chapter.

payment was made, the person paying such tax (hereinafter referred to as
“claimant”) may file a claim for credit or refund with the City on forms

with which to meet the needs of the City for the provisions of protective
services to the users of the waters within the City and the enforcement of laws

the dock or boat storage rack rent charged by an operator, and shown separately
on any record thereof, on any bill or statement or charge made for such rent
issued or delivered by the operator, and the tax shall be paid by the owner of
the watercraft to the operator as trustee for and on account of the City, and
the operator shall be liable for the collection thereof and for the tax.
   (b)   No operator of a marina or boat storage rack facility shall advertise
or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any
part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not
be added to the dockage or rack storage rent, or that, if added, any part will
be refunded.

Dock and Boat Storage Rack Tax Ordinance by registering with the Finance
Director for the purpose of collecting from owners of watercraft and the Dock
and Boat Storage Rack Tax and remitting said tax to the Finance Director. This
certificate does not constitute a permit."
   
   Each certificate issued hereunder shall be effective for an annual period
beginning May 1 or for such portion thereof as may be appropriate, and shall be
renewable thereafter for additional periods of twelve months upon application
for renewal effected in the manner and form as prescribed by the Finance
Director.
(Ord. 05-107. Passed 6-27-05.)
   199.05 REPORTING AND REMITTING.
   Each operator, on or before May 1 of each calendar year, or at the close of
any other reporting period which may be established by the Finance Director,
shall make a return to the Finance Director, on forms provided by him, of the
total amount of the tax due. All claims for exemption from the tax claimed for
the reporting period shall be filed with the report. At the time the return is

the tax, and he may require further information in the return if the
information is pertinent to the collection of the tax. All returns and payments
submitted by each operator shall be treated as confidential by the Finance

remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition
to the penalties stated in subsection (a) hereof.
   (c)   Interest. In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any owner of
a watercraft or operator of a boat storage rack facility who fails to remit any
tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one percent (1%)
per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax exclusive of
penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until
paid.

the serving or mailing of the notice, make application in writing to the
Finance Director for a hearing on the amount assessed. If an application by the
owner or operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the
tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Finance Director, shall
become final and conclusive, and immediately due and payable. If an application
is made, the Finance Director shall give not less than five days' written
notice in the manner prescribed herein to the owner or operator to show cause
at a time and places fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein
should not be fixed for the tax, interest and penalties. At the hearing, the
owner or operator may appear and offer evidence why the specified tax, interest
and penalties should not be so fixed. After the hearing, the Finance Director
shall determine the proper tax to be remitted, and shall give written notice to

   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into

vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card

operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.

established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence within ninety days of the underlying violation that
resulted in the imposition of the additional fine under this section.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section. If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course. The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence within ninety days of
the underlying violation that resulted in the imposition of the additional fine
under this section.
   (c)   If a law enforcement officer issues an offender a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of subsection (b) of this section that indicates that
the offender was distracted while committing the violation and that the
distracting activity was a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the officer shall do both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.

(ORC 4511.12)
   313.02 THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section. Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations. When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes
a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing or
removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway or
portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence districts the
Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. Where two or
more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b) intersect and no
traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department of
Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop. Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the operator
of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. (ORC
4511.65)
   313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right to
proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow,
and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop
at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication. A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified
in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or
affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the
maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a registered
nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall

controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B. hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B. hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.
If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)(5) of Ohio
R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as required
under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an independent
test performed at the person’s expense. The failure or inability to obtain an
additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the admission of
evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports.  
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
          D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified

   (h)   General OVI Penalty.  
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a
controlled substance. The court shall sentence the offender for either offense
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as otherwise
authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days. As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours. The court may sentence an offender to
both an intervention program and a jail term. The court may impose a jail term
in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program.
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program. The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs. The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two

both of the following:
      (1)   Report the issuance of the ticket, citation, or summons to the
officer’s law enforcement agency;
      (2)   Ensure that such report indicates the offender’s race.
   (d)   Whoever violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of operating
a motor vehicle while using an electronic wireless communication device, an
unclassified misdemeanor, and shall be punished as provided in subsections (d)
(1) to (5) of this section.
      (1)   The offender shall be fined, and is subject to a suspension of the
offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction
permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege, as follows:
         A.   Except as provided in subsections (d)(1)B., (d)(1)C., (d)(1)D.
and (d)(2) of this section, the court shall impose upon the offender a fine of

         B.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one prior violation of this section, Ohio
R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the court
shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00).
         C.   If, within two years of the violation, the offender has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more prior violations of this section,
Ohio R.C. 4511.204, or a substantially equivalent or municipal ordinance, the
court shall impose upon the offender a fine of not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00). The court also may impose a suspension of the offender’s
driver’s license, commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege for ninety days.
         D.   Notwithstanding subsections (d)(1)A. to (d)(1)C. of this section,
if the offender was operating the motor vehicle at the time of the violation in
a construction zone where a sign was posted in accordance with Ohio R.C.
4511.98, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, shall
impose upon the offender a fine of two times the amount imposed for the
violation under subsections (d)(1)A., (d)(1)B., or (d)(1)C. of this section, as
applicable.
      (2)   If the offender is in the category of offenders to whom subsection
(d)(1)A of this section applies, in lieu of payment of the fine of one hundred
fifty dollars ($150.00) under subsection (d)(1)A. of this section and the
assessment of points under subsection (d)(4) of this section, the offender

      (5)   The offense established under this section is a strict liability
offense and Ohio R.C. 2901.20 does not apply. The designation of this offense
as a strict liability offense shall not be construed to imply that any other
offense, for which there is no specified degree of culpability, is not a strict
liability offense.
   (e)   A prosecution for an offense in violation of this section does not
preclude a prosecution for an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.204 based
on the same conduct. However, the two offenses are allied offenses of similar
import under Ohio R.C. 2941.25.
   (f)   (1)   A law enforcement officer does not have probable cause and shall
not stop the operator of a motor vehicle for the purposes of enforcing this
section unless the officer visually observes the operator using, holding, or

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public
road or highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person

commercial driver's license issued under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4506.
      (2)   No person, except a person expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motorcycle upon a public road
or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507. The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section. The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license issued by this state or any other
jurisdiction, or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the
offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When

pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor. If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

instruction permits, and identification cards issued to the person by another
jurisdiction recognized by this state.
      (2)   The Registrar shall report the cancellation of a license, temporary
instruction permit, or identification card to the issuing authority, together

         (ORC 4507.02(A))
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever
violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When
the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, except that the offender shall not be
sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding division
(A)(2)(a) of Ohio R.C. 2929.28, the offender may be fined up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the
offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours. The failure of an
offender to complete a term of community service imposed by the court may be
punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2705.02
that may be filed in the underlying case. If, within three years of the

citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being

   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order. The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination. If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar,

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the offense is an
unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced pursuant to Ohio R.C.

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

evidence as prima-facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may offer
evidence to rebut this prima-facie evidence.

the vehicle involved in the offense for sixty days and the impoundment of that
vehicle’s license plates for sixty days in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
         C.   If the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted
of or pleaded guilty to three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.11, or any
combination of three or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4501.11 or Ohio R.C.

   (g)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for any
economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle before, during, or

as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence. But the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of evidence
that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action and may
diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic loss,
as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.    It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that

ownership of the motor vehicle and pays all towing and storage fees normally
imposed by the municipality for towing and storing motor vehicles. If the motor
vehicle is a leased vehicle, it shall not be released to the lessee until the

(e) of this section shall fail to properly mark the accessible parking
locations in accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of
the accessible locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed

offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating

Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or

Municipality for purposes of this section.

expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the

      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused absented himself

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)    The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09 ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt. An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted. In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.02)
   501.10 COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
(1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
(2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
(3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
      "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
   inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
   or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
   of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
   testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
   it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11 ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
(1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in conduct
constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct, or
tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
(2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. (ORC
2901.24)
   501.13 CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,

a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy. For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators. In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section. In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01. (ORC 2923.01)
   
   501.99 PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
     (a)   Financial Sanctions. In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section and, if the offender is
being sentenced for a criminal offense as defined in Ohio R.C. 2930.01, shall
sentence the offender to make restitution pursuant to this section and Ohio
R.C. 2929.281. If the court, in its discretion or as required by this section,
imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions that may be
imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Restitution.  
         A.   Unless the misdemeanor offense could be disposed of by the
traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13, restitution
by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or the victim’s estate,
in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. The court may not impose
restitution as a sanction pursuant to this section if the offense could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13. If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         B.   The court shall determine the amount of restitution to be paid by
the offender. The victim, victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if
applicable, the prosecutor or the prosecutor’s designee, and the offender may
provide information relevant to the determination of the amount of restitution.
The amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court imposes restitution for the cost of
accounting or auditing done to determine the extent of economic loss, the court
may order restitution for any amount of the victim’s costs of accounting or
auditing provided that the amount of restitution is reasonable and does not
exceed the value of property or services stolen or damaged as a result of the
offense. If the court decides to or is required to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
victim’s representative, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or victim’s estate
disputes the amount of restitution. The court shall determine the amount of
full restitution by a preponderance of the evidence.
         C.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery
of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or the victim’s estate
against the offender. No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         D.   The court may order that the offender pay a surcharge, of not
more than five percent (5%) of the amount of the restitution otherwise ordered,
to the entity responsible for collecting and processing restitution payments.
E.   The victim, victim’s attorney, if applicable, or the attorney for the
victim’s estate may request that the prosecutor in the case file a motion, or
the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment terms of any
restitution ordered. If the court grants the motion, it may modify the payment
terms as it determines appropriate but shall not reduce the amount of
restitution ordered, except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.281(A).
      (2)   Fines. A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021 and the costs of
global positioning system device monitoring;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection. If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms.  
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred eighty
days;
B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B). The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations. Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections (a)
and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section. The court shall fix the
fine as follows:
Type of Misdemeanor                           Maximum Fine
First degree                                  $5000.00
Second degree                                 4000.00
Third degree                                  3000.00
Fourth degree                                 2000.00
Minor                                         1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified       2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not specifically classified 1000.00
(1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in
this subsection (c).
(2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than the fine that
is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant

herein shall be interpreted so as to require the person to make any statement
to officers. The failure of a person to avail himself or herself of said
opportunity shall not be construed or utilized as a factor in the determination

involved in, the offense to determine whether the substance contained any
amount of a controlled substance if the results of the tests indicate that the

   519.01 DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   Whereas noise has been proven to have demonstrable adverse physiological,
biochemical and psychological impacts on humans; and, whereas the noxious
stimulus of noise has long been used as a laboratory model for producing
stress; and whereas noise has been clearly implicated in sleep disturbance
resulting in a cascade of negative effects; and, whereas the stress, tension
and fatigue associated with long-term exposure to noise has destroyed
marriages, cost people their jobs and forced other people to sell their houses
at significant losses; and, whereas there are documented cases of arson,
assault, murder and suicide arising from noise exposure or disputes; and
whereas a substantial body of science and technology exists by which excessive
sound may be substantially abated; and, whereas the people have a right to, and
should be ensured of, an environment free from excessive sound; and, whereas
every citizen has right to the peaceable enjoyment of their private property,
and the usability of their commercial and industrial property.
   Now therefore, it is the policy of the City of Sandusky to prevent excessive
sound that may jeopardize the health, welfare, or safety of the citizens or
degrade the quality of life.
(Ord. 03-089. Passed 4-14-03.)
   519.02  DEFINITIONS.
   The following words and terms, when used in this chapter, shall have the
following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
(a)   “A-weighted sound level” means the sound level as measured using the “A”
weighting network with a sound level meter meeting the standards set forth in
ANSI S1.4-1983 or its successors. The unit of reporting is dB(A). Sounds
measured with the “A” weighting network approximate the response of human
hearing when measuring sounds of low to moderate intensity.
(b)   “Agricultural activities” means those activities performed on farmlands
in order to cultivate the soil, produce crops, or raise livestock.
(c)   “ANSI” means the American National Standards Institute, which serves as
the administrator and coordinator of the United States private sector voluntary
standardization system. ANSI facilitates development of American National
Standards (ANS’s) by establishing consensus among qualified groups. ANS’s in
the fields of acoustics and sound measurement are developed by the Acoustical
Society of America in order to standardize practices and equipment.
(d)   “Boom box” means a colloquial term for self-contained, portable, hand-
held music or sound amplification or reproduction equipment emitting sound that
is audible at distances exceeding the permissible limits established within
this chapter.
(e)   “Boom car” means a colloquial term for a personal or commercial vehicle
with music amplification or reproduction equipment emitting sound that is
audible at distances exceeding the permissible limits established within this
chapter.
(f)   “C-weighted sound level” means the sound level as measured using the “C”
weighting network with a sound level meter meeting the standards set forth in
ANSI S1.4-1983 or its successors. The unit of reporting is dB(C). The “C”
weighting network is more sensitive to low frequencies than is the “A”
weighting network.
(g)   “Commercial facility” means any premises, property or facility involving
traffic in goods or furnishing of services for sale or profit including, but
not limited to:
(1)   Banking and other financial institutions;
(2)   Dining establishments;
(3)   Establishments for providing retail or wholesale services;
(4)   Establishments for recreation and entertainment;
(5)   Establishments providing commercial living accommodations and commercial
property used for human habitation, when such is the source of the sound under
investigation;
(6)   Establishments, providing living accommodations which exceed six dwelling
units;
(7)   Office buildings;
(8)   Transportation;
(9)   Warehouses.
(h)   “Community service facility” means any non-residential facility used to
provide services to the public, including but not limited to:
(1)   Club meeting halls, offices and facilities;
(2)   Organization offices and facilities;
(3)   Facilities for the support and practice of religion;
(4)   Private and parochial schools.
(i)   “Continuous sound” means any sound with a duration of more than one
second, as measured with a sound level meter set to the “slow” meter response.
Impulsive sounds that are rapidly repetitive and have a duration of one second
or longer shall be measured as continuous airborne sound.
(j)   “Construction” means any site preparation, assembly, erection, repair,
alteration or similar action, including demolition of buildings or structures.
(k)   “Demolition” means any dismantling, destruction or removal of buildings,
structures, or roadways.
(l)   “Decibel (dB)” means a relative unit for the measurement of sound
pressure. It is based upon a reference pressure of 20 micropascals (zero
decibels) which is the average threshold of hearing for a human with acute
hearing. The decibel scale is logarithmic, and as such, an increase or decrease
of 3 dB is a doubling or halving of sound pressure.
(m)   “Emergency energy release device” means a device used specifically to
release excess energy on a non-scheduled basis as necessary for purposes of
safety and not as a part of routine process control.
(n)   “Emergency work” means any work or action necessary to deliver essential
public services including, but not limited to, repairing water, gas, electric,
telephone, sewer facilities, or public transportation facilities, removing
fallen trees on public rights-of-way, dredging navigational waterways, or
abating threatening conditions.
(o)   “Extraneous sound” means a sound which is relatively intense,
intermittent and of short duration and is neither part of the neighborhood
residual sound, nor comes from the sound source under investigation. These
sources of sound are noted, but excluded from all measurements.
(p)   “Frequency” means the time rate of repetition of sound waves in cycles
per second, reported as Hertz (Hz). “Frequency” is sometimes colloquially
referred to as “pitch.” Low frequency sounds can correspond to the bass notes
in music. Low frequency sound waves travel farther and penetrate structures
more efficiently than high frequency sound waves.
(q)   “Impulsive sound” means either a single pressure peak or a single burst
(multiple pressure peaks) that has a duration of less than one second.
(r)   “Industrial facility” means any activity and its related premises,
property, facilities, or equipment involving the fabrication, manufacture, or
production of durable or non-durable goods.
(s)   “Motor vehicle" means every vehicle propelled or drawn by power other
than muscular power or power collected from overhead electric trolley wires,
except motorized bicycles, road rollers, traction engines, power shovels, power
cranes, and other equipment used in construction work and not designed for or
employed in general highway transportation, hole-digging machinery, well-
drilling machinery, ditch-digging machinery, farm machinery, trailers used to
transport agricultural produce or agricultural production materials between a
local place of storage or supply and the farm when drawn or towed on a street
or highway at a speed of twenty-five miles per hour or less, threshing
machinery, hay-baling machinery, agricultural tractors and machinery used in
the production of horticultural, floricultural, agricultural, and vegetable
products, and trailers designed and used exclusively to transport a boat
between a place of storage and a marina, or in and around a marina, when drawn
or towed on a street or highway for a distance of no more than ten miles and at
a speed of twenty-five miles per hour or less. (O.R.C. 4511.01(B))
(t)   “Muffler” means a properly functioning sound dissipative device or system
for abating the sound of escaping gasses on equipment where such a device is
part of the normal configuration of the equipment.
(u)   “Multi-dwelling unit building” means any building comprising two or more
dwelling units, including, but not limited to, apartments, condominiums, co-
ops, multiple family houses, townhouses, and attached residences.
(v)   “Multi-use property” means any distinct parcel of land that is used for
more than one category of activity. Examples include, but are not limited to:
(1)   A commercial, residential, industrial or public service property having
boilers, incinerators, elevators, automatic garage doors, air conditioners,
laundry rooms, utility provisions, or health and recreational facilities, or
other similar devices or areas, either in the interior or on the exterior of
the building, which may be a source of elevated sound levels at another
category on the same distinct parcel of land; or
(2)   A building, which is both commercial (usually on the ground floor) and
residential property, located above, behind, below or adjacent.
(w)   “Neighborhood residual sound level” means that measured value, which
represents the summation of the sound from all of the discrete sources
affecting a given site at a given time, exclusive of extraneous sounds, and
those from the source under investigation. Neighborhood residual sound level is
synonymous with background or ambient sound level. Neighborhood residual sounds
are differentiated from extraneous sounds by the fact that the former are more
steady state, although they may not be continuous.
(x)   “Noise Control Officer” means a government employee who has received
noise enforcement training and is currently certified in noise enforcement. The
employee must be acting within his or her designated jurisdiction and must be
authorized to issue a summons in order to be considered a Noise Control
Officer. The provisions of this chapter that do not require the use of a sound
level meter may be enforced by any certified police officer.
(y)   “Noise sensitive” means a facility whose operations may be detrimentally
impacted by excessive sound levels. Such facilities include but are not limited
to:
(1)   Schools;
(2)   Houses of worship;
(3)   Outpatient medical facilities.
(z)   “Plainly audible” means any sound that can be detected by a person using
his or her unaided hearing faculties. As an example, if the sound source under
investigation is a portable or personal vehicular sound amplification or
reproduction device, the detection of the rhythmic bass component of the music
is sufficient to verify plainly audible sound. The Noise Control Officer need
not determine the title, specific words, or the artist performing the song.
(aa)   “Private right-of-way” means any street, avenue, boulevard, road,
highway, sidewalk, ally or easement that is owned, leased, or controlled by a
non- governmental entity.
(bb)   “Public right-of-way” means any street, avenue, boulevard, road,
highway, sidewalk, alley or easement that is owned, leased, or controlled by a
governmental entity.
(cc)   “Public service facility” means any facility and its related premises,
property or equipment used to provide governmental services to the public
including, but not limited to:
(1)   Maintenance centers;
(2)   Offices and buildings of agencies or instrumentalities of government;
(3)   Schools;
(4)   Waste collection centers;
(5)   Waste recycling centers;
(6)   Water and sewage facilities.
(dd)   “Public property” means any real property or structures thereon that are
owned, leased, or controlled by a governmental entity.
(ee)   “Real property line” means either:
(1)   The imaginary line including its vertical extension that separates one
parcel of real property from another;
(2)   The vertical and horizontal boundaries of a dwelling unit that is part of
a multi-dwelling unit building; or
(3)   On a multi-use property, the interface between the two portions of the
property on which different categories of activity are being performed (e.g.,
if the multi-use property is a building which is residential upstairs and
commercial downstairs, then the real property line would be the interface
between the residential area and the commercial area).
(ff)   “Residential property” means property used for human habitation
including, but not limited to:
(1)   Private property used for human habitation;
(2)   Commercial living accommodations and commercial property used for human
habitation;
(3)   Recreational and entertainment property used for human habitation;
(4)   Community service property used for human habitation;
(5)   Hospitals or long-term care medical facilities.
(gg)   “Sound level meter”    means an instrument, which conforms to ANSI S1.4-
1983 or its successors.
(hh)   “Total sound level” means that measured level which represents the
summation of the sounds from the sound source under investigation and the
neighborhood residual sounds which affect a given place at a given time,
exclusive of extraneous sound sources.
(ii)   “Weekday” means any day that is not a federal holiday, and beginning on
Monday at 7:00 a.m. and ending on the following Friday at 6:00 p.m.
(jj)   “Weekends” means beginning on Friday at 6:00 p.m. and ending on the
following Monday at 7:00 a.m.
      (Ord. 03-089. Passed 4-14-03.)

      (Ord. 03-089. Passed 4-14-03.)
   519.05 NOISE CONTROL OFFICERS.
   The provisions of this chapter may be enforced by Noise Control Officers. A
person shall be qualified to be a Noise Control Officer if the person meets the
criteria set forth in the definition contained in Section
519.02 and completes, at a frequency specified by the Noise Control
Administrator, a noise certification and re-certification course which has been
approved by the Administrator. The provisions of this chapter that do not
require the use of a sound level meter or the provisions of any other
applicable ordinances may be enforced by any certified police officer, whether
qualified as a Noise Control Officer or not.
   Noise Control Officers shall have the power to:
(a)   Investigate and pursue possible violations of this chapter for sound
levels which equal or exceed the sound levels set forth in Table I, when
measured at a receiving property located within the designated jurisdiction of
the Noise Control Officer, in accordance with Section
519.06 below.
(b)   While acting within his or her designated jurisdiction, enforce all of
the provisions of this chapter including the criminal and civil penalties for

ordinances.
      (Ord. 03-089. Passed 4-14-03.)
   519.06 MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE SOUND LEVELS.
   (a)   Continuous Sound.
(1)   No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the operation of any
source of sound on any source property listed in
519.03(a) above in such a manner as to create a sound level that exceeds the
sound level limits listed in Table I, as measured at any location at or within
the property line of the receptor property. Sound pressure levels in excess of
those established in Table I shall constitute prima facie evidence that such
sound is in violation of this chapter.

(2)   These limits may not be exceeded by any single incident representing the
normal, usual operation of the sound source, during any three sampling
intervals, the duration of which shall be no less than one half minute, within
any one hour period. If the total duration of the sound under investigation is
less than one and one half minute, the requirement for three measurements shall
be waived. For example, if a motor fan belt were to squeal for twenty seconds
upon starting, but the sound were emitted with regularity from this source, a
single measurement shall be sufficient.
(3)   Nothing in this section supersedes the requirements of employers to
comply with the Occupational Noise Exposure Standard of the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (29 CFR Part 1910.95). Compliance will help conserve
workers’ hearing, and reduce potential liability for the source.
   (b)   Impulsive Sound.
(1)   Between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. impulsive sounds, which occur less than
ten times in an hour shall not equal or exceed 20 decibels above the
permissible sound level limits in Table I. Impulsive sound which repeats ten or
more times in any hour shall not exceed the permissible sound level limits in
Table I.
(2)   Between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., impulsive sounds which
occur less than four times in an hour shall not equal or exceed 20 decibels
above the permissible sound level limits in Table I. Impulsive sound which
repeats four or more times in any hour shall not exceed the permissible sound
level limits in Table I.
   (c)   Amplified Sound Reproduction Device. If the source of sound is an
amplified sound reproduction device, and the complainant states that the
rhythmic bass component of the music is disturbing within their residence then
the Noise Control Officer shall be authorized to take sound level measurements
within the residence of the complainant. No person shall cause, suffer, allow,
or permit the operation of any amplified source of sound in such a manner that
it raises the total sound levels by the permissible sound level limits set
forth in Table II when measured within the residence of a complainant. These
sound level measurements shall be conducted with the sound level meter set for
“C” weighting, “fast” response. Such measurements shall not be taken in areas,
which receive only casual use such as hallways, closets and bathrooms. For the
purposes of these measurements, the neighborhood residual sound level is that
sound level which is measured in the residence when the sound source under
investigation is not prominent, or in a room on the same floor that is
relatively unaffected by the sound source under investigation. The C-scale is
more sensitive to low frequency sound levels than the A-scale. An increase of 3
dB is perceived by humans as being perceptibly louder, while an increase of 5
dB is perceived as being plainly louder. At the lower bass frequencies of music
an increase of 6 dB is perceived as a doubling of loudness.

   (d)   Steady Pure Tones. If the sound source under investigation is a
mechanical device, and is in the investigating Noise Control Officer’s opinion
emitting a sound with a steady pure tonal quality, the permissible sound level
limits in Table I shall be reduced by 5 dB(A). The sound emissions must be
comprised of a single frequency or a narrow cluster of frequencies, which may
be referred to as a whine, hum or buzz. The measured sound levels of such a
source must not fluctuate by more than plus or minus 3dB. Such sound sources
include, but are not limited to, heating, ventilating or air-conditioning
units; refrigeration units; and transformers.
(Ord. 03-089. Passed 4-14-03.)
   519.07 PROCEDURES FOR THE DETERMINATION OF SOUND LEVELS.
   (a)   When applicable, the sound level shall be measured with a sound level
meter. The sound level meter and calibrator must be re-certified annually at a
laboratory approved by the Administrator. A field check of meter calibration
and batteries must be conducted before and after every set of measurements.
   (b)   Total and neighborhood residual sound level measurements shall be
taken. Calculation of source sound levels shall conform with accepted practice.
(Ord. 03-089. Passed 4-14-03.)
   519.08 INSPECTIONS.
   (a)   For the purpose of determining compliance with the provisions of this
chapter, the Noise Control Administrator, any Noise Control Officer or any
certified police officer in addition to any other authority, upon presentation
of proper credentials, shall enter and inspect any dwelling, multi-family
dwelling, building, structure, or premises within the City as may be necessary
to enforce the provisions of this Chapter including taking sound level
measurements and tests. If permission is refused or is otherwise unobtainable,
a search warrant shall be obtained to permit entry and access for the purpose
of inspecting, testing, and measuring sound levels.
   (b)   It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse to allow or permit the
Noise Control Administrator, any Noise Control Officer or any certified police
officer free access to any premises when such person is acting in compliance
with a search warrant.
   (c)   Misrepresentation to avoid compliance. It shall be unlawful for any
person to misrepresent or give any false information or in any way attempt to
deceive the Noise Control Administrator, any Noise Control Officer or any
certified police officer in order to avoid compliance with the provisions of
this chapter.
(Ord. 03-089. Passed 4-14-03.)
   519.09 EXCEPTIONS.
   The operational performance standards established in this chapter shall not
apply to any of the following noise sources:
(a)   Agricultural activities;
(b)   Unamplified bells, chimes or carillons while being used in conjunction
with an ongoing religious service;
(c)   Emergency energy release devices;

impact on property affected, and any other adverse impacts of granting the
waiver. Applicants for waiver and persons contesting waiver may be required to
submit any information the Noise Control Administrator may reasonably require.
In granting or denying an application, the Noise Control Administrator shall
place for public view in the Department of Community Development a copy of the
decision and the reasons for denying or granting the waiver.

applying for a waiver and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether to
grant a waiver.

declares that the accumulation and storage of unlicenced, abandoned, wrecked,
junked, partially dismantled or inoperative motor vehicles on private property,
which motor vehicles are in the nature of rubbish and unsightly debris,
violates regulations of the City and constitutes a nuisance detrimental to the
health, safety and welfare of the community in that such conditions tend to
interfere with the enjoyment of and reduce the value of private property,
invite plundering, create fire hazards, and other safety and health hazards to
minors as well as adults, interfere with the comfort and well-being of the
public and create, extend and aggravate urban blight, and that the public
health, safety and general welfare require that such conditions be regulated,
abated and prohibited.
   (b)   Storage on Private Property.
(1)   No person in charge or in control of any property within the City,
whether as owner, tenant, occupant, lessee or otherwise, shall park, store,
leave, or permit the parking or storing of any motor vehicle or any vehicle in
a wrecked, junked, partially dismantled, unlicenced, inoperative or abandoned
condition, whether attended or not, for a period in excess of five calendar
days upon any private property in the City, unless the same is completely
enclosed within a building, or unless it is in connection with a business
enterprise operated in a lawful place and manner and licensed as such, when
necessary to the operation of such business enterprise or is a collector’s
vehicle pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F).
(2)   For the purpose of this section, a motor vehicle shall be deemed to be in
a wrecked or junk condition if any of the following apply:
A.   The vehicle is extremely damaged including but not limited to any of the
following: missing wheels, tires, motors or transmissions.
B.   The vehicle is apparently inoperable.
C.   The vehicle is unlicenced.
D.   The motor vehicle is inoperable, junk or wrecked as defined in Section

degree. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation occurs or continues.
   (c)   Removal Required. The accumulation and storage of one or more such
motor vehicles in violation of the provisions of this section shall constitute
rubbish and unsightly debris, and shall constitute a nuisance, detrimental to
the health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of the City. The
registered owner of such motor vehicle, and the person in charge or control of
the private property upon which such motor vehicle is located, whether as
owner, tenant, occupant, lessee or otherwise shall remove the same to a place
of lawful storage, or shall have the motor vehicle housed within a building
where it will be visible from the street.
   (d)   Notice to Remove. Whenever there are reasonable grounds to believe
that a violation of the provisions of this section exists, the Code Compliance
Officer and/or Chief of Police shall give, or cause to be given, written notice
to the registered owner of any motor vehicle which is in violation of this
section, or to the owner or person in lawful possession or control of such
private property, by certified mail with return receipt or by personal service,
that such motor vehicle is to be removed to a place of lawful storage or to be
housed in a building where it will not be visible from the street.
   (e)   Removal by City. In addition to and not in lieu of any other procedure
or penalty prescribed in this section, this chapter, or in the Traffic Code for
removal of abandoned motor vehicles from private property, if the registered
owner of any motor vehicle which is in violation of this section, or the owner
or person in lawful possession or control of the private property upon which
the same is located, fails, neglects or refuses to remove or house such
abandoned, wrecked, junked, partially dismantled or inoperative motor vehicle
in accordance with the notice given pursuant to the provisions of subsection
(d) hereof, the Code Compliance Officer and/or the Chief of Police may remove
and dispose of such motor vehicle.
   (f)   Right of Entry. The Code Compliance Officer and/or Chief of Police,
any contracting agent of the City, and employee of such contracting agent, and
authorized officer, employee and agent of the City, and each of them, are
hereby expressly authorized to enter upon private property for the purpose of

person to whom notice was given pursuant to subsection (d) hereof shall have
the right to remove or house such motor vehicle of the Code Compliance Officer

Commission, in addition to any powers heretofore conferred in this Commission,
shall have the power to:
      (1)   Formulate a plan of education to advance freedom of choice in

   (b)    The provisions of this code establishing a Fair Housing Board and
regulating its functions are set forth in Chapter

   539.06  ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE.
   (a)    An aggrieved individual may, by setting forth the facts in writing
under oath or affirmation, file his complaint alleging a violation of Section
539.03 with the Community Relations Commission.
   (b)    The Commission shall make a prompt and full investigation of each
complaint alleging any practice made unlawful under this chapter. The
investigation shall be conducted within thirty days after the filing of same.
   (c)    The complaint, along with the results of the investigation, and any
records, papers, or statements pertaining thereto, shall be transmitted to the
Fair Housing Board unless the Community Relations Commission can by
conciliation promptly eliminate the particular discriminatory practice
complained of, and, where applicable, receive reasonable assurance from the
person complained of, of the discontinuance of further discriminatory practices
in regard to housing.
   (d)    The Fair Housing Board, hereinafter referred to as the Housing Board,
shall consider the complaint, together with the results of the investigation by
the Community Relations Commission and any records, papers, or statements
pertaining thereto, and make a determination within ten days as to whether or
not there appears to be a prima facie case of a violation of the provisions of
this chapter. Within five days of such determination the Housing Board shall in
writing inform all interested parties of the results of the determination.
   (e)    (1)    If the Housing Board deems the complaint well-founded on its
face, it shall, at the same time as it provides the foregoing notice, serve
upon the person charged with engaging or with having engaged in the
discriminatory act or practice a statement of the charges made in the
complaint, particularly describing the property involved, if any, together with
notice of the time and place of a public hearing thereon. The hearing shall be
held not less than ten nor more than thirty days after the service of the
statement of charges. The respondent shall have the right to file an answer to
the statement of charges, to appear in person at the hearing, to be represented
by counsel, to examine and cross-examine witnesses, and to present testimony on
his own behalf. The case for the complainant shall be presented by the Director
of Law’s office. In any hearing, the Housing Board shall not be bound by the
rules of evidence prevailing in the courts of law or equity, but shall take
into account all reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, statistical or
otherwise, produced at the hearing, which may tend to prove the existence of a
discriminatory act or practice. No person shall be compelled to be a witness
against himself at any hearing before the Housing Board.
(2)    The complainant shall be a party to the proceeding, and any person who
is an indispensable party to a complete determination or settlement of question
involved in a proceeding shall be joined. Any person who has or claims an
interest in the subject of the hearing, and in obtaining or preventing relief
against the acts or practices complained of, may at his option appear for the
presentation of oral or written arguments.
   (f)    If upon all the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, the
Housing Board finds that the respondent has engaged or is engaging in any
unlawful practice, it shall issue such order or orders as the facts warrant and
shall state its findings of fact in support thereof. Such order or orders may
include:
(1)    That the respondent forthwith permit the complainant the right or
privilege as constituted the subject of the complaint;
      (2)   An order that the respondent perform an affirmative act that would
otherwise have been performed had the complainant not been discriminated
against because of race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, sex,
sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, familial status, military
status, or handicap;
(3)    An order that the respondent cease and desist from the same or similar
discriminatory practices which were the subject of the complaint with respect
to the same or other property covered by Section
539.01.
   (g)    At any time after the transmittal to the Housing Board of a
complaint, the Housing Board shall have the authority, with the consent of the
respondent, to make findings and issue appropriate orders without the necessity
of a public hearing on the complaint.
   (h)    Unless an appeal is pending, in the event the respondent fails or
appears to intend to fail to comply with an order issued by the Housing Board,
it shall certify the case, together with the record of its proceedings,
including a transcript, and the available evidence of noncompliance to the
Director of Law's office, whose mandatory duty it shall then be to seek
compliance by civil action brought in the name of the Fair Housing Board of the
City before a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that the Director of
Law's office may permit the proceeding to be brought by private counsel of the
complainant.
   (i)    Any party to the proceeding, claiming to be aggrieved by a final
order of the Housing Board, including a determination by the Housing Board that
a prima facie case was not established by the complainant, may obtain judicial
review thereof by resort to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance
with the provision of Ohio R.C. Ch. 2506.
(Ord. 18-090. Passed 5-14-18.)
   539.07  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   If at any time after the transmittal of the complaint, it would appear that,
prior to the completion of the Housing Board's action on the complaint, the
housing which is the subject of the complaint may be sold, rented, or otherwise
made unavailable to the complainant, or that other irreparable harm may occur,
the complainant may file before a court of competent jurisdiction an action for
a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to preserve the
status quo, and to prevent irreparable harm pending final action of the
complaint.
(Ord. 18-090. Passed 5-14-18.)
   539.08 CIVIL ACTION.
   A plaintiff aggrieved under any of the provisions of Section
 539.03 may proceed with a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction.
The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent or
temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000) punitive damages, together with the court costs and reasonable

   541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
(1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
(2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to its
former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable cost
of restoring the property.
(3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to its
former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal property,
is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind and
quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section. (ORC 2909.11)
   541.02  ARSON.

or create a substantial risk of physical harm to any structure of another that
is not an occupied structure;
      (2)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under subsection (b)(1) of
this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree. If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
(ORC 2909.03)
   541.03 CRIMINAL DAMAGING OR ENDANGERING.

(2)   Recklessly, by means of fire, explosion, flood, poison gas, poison,
radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of criminal damaging or
endangering, a misdemeanor of the second degree. If violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an
aircraft and if the violation creates a risk of physical harm to any person or

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

545.05 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section. While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services. As used in this section, "fair market
value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller would
accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to buy and
the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all facts
material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to act.
 
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.

   717.01 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the emergency services of
the Police and Fire Departments of the City from misuse, by responding to
defective alarm systems, excessive false alarms and nuisance 9-1-1 telephone
calls.
   (b)   This chapter governs alarm systems, alarm users, telephone subscribers
with access to emergency 9-1-1 services and businesses that provide on-premise
public pay telephone service. It provides for violations and penalties for
excessive false alarms.
(Ord. 04-203. Passed 12-13-04.)
   717.02 DEFINITIONS.
   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
following meanings respectively ascribed to them in this section:
   “Alarm system” means any assembly of equipment, mechanical or electrical,
arranged to signal audibly, visibly or electronically to a location outside the
structures protected by the system or to a monitoring station which in turn
notifies the appropriate agency, the occurrence of an illegal entry or other
activity requiring urgent attention to which the Police Department or Fire
Department is expected to respond, but shall not include alarms installed in
motor vehicles.
   “Alarm user” means the person, partnership, corporation or any other entity
in control of any building, structure or facility, or any portion thereof,
which is intended to be protected by an alarm system.
   “Audible alarm” means any alarm system which is designed to emit its signal
by bell, whistle, siren or other device to the immediate area near the
structure which it protects. An audible alarm shall be considered as such
whether or not it transmits a signal to an additional location.
   “False alarm” means an alarm system, a signal or message eliciting an urgent
response by the Fire Department or Police Department when a situation requiring
such response by the Police or Fire Department does not in fact exist; but does
not include extraordinary circumstances not reasonably subject to control by
the alarm user. An alarm which has been activated as a result of testing or
repair shall not be considered as a false alarm if prior notification has been
given as to the time and day of such repairs or test to the agency which the
alarm would signal. An alarm which has been activated shall not be considered
as a false alarm if the responding department receives a request to cancel.
Such request shall be made to the same location as the request for service and
shall be received prior to the dispatch of the responding Police or Fire unit.
(Ord. 04-203. Passed 12-13-04.)
   717.03 ALARM VALIDITY DETERMINATION.
   (a)   Whenever an alarm is activated requiring an emergency response to the
location by the Fire Department or Police Department, a police officer or
firefighter who responds to the alarm address shall inspect the areas protected
by the system and shall determine whether the emergency response was in fact
required as indicated by the alarm system.
   (b)   If the inspecting police officer or firefighter determines the signal
to be a false alarm, the police officer or firefighter shall make a report of
the false alarm to the respective Records Section. A notification of the false
alarm report shall be mailed or delivered to the alarm user, at the address of
the alarm system, advising the user of the false alarm.
(Ord. 04-203. Passed 12-13-04.)
   717.04  APPEAL OF FALSE ALARM DETERMINATION.
   (a)   Upon receipt of any false alarm report from the Fire Department or
Police Department, the alarm user may elect to respond in writing to explain
the actual cause of such alarm. Such response shall be made to the issuing
agency within ten days from the date of the receipt of the false alarm report.
If the Chief of the issuing agency upholds the false alarm determination, the
alarm user shall have thirty days from the date of notification in which to
request an appeal to the City Manager.
   (b)   The City Manager, or designee, shall hear appeals from the alarm user
on the issue of whether the alarm system in question activated a false alarm as
determined by the police officer or firefighter at the scene of such activated
alarm.
   (c)   At the hearing, which shall be scheduled within fifteen days from the
date the request for the hearing is received, the alarm user shall have the
right to present evidence and testimony that a false alarm did not occur.
   (d)   The City Manager or designee shall make a decision whether to uphold
or disallow the false alarm report and shall notify the alarm user and the
Records Section of the respective Department within ten days from the date the
hearing is concluded.
(Ord. 04-203. Passed 12-13-04.)
   717.05  EXCESSIVE FALSE ALARMS; CHARGES.
   (a)   If more than two false alarms occur at a particular location in any
calendar year, then the Fire Chief or Police Chief shall invoice the alarm user
as defined in Section
717.02 for reimbursement of a portion of the costs of responding to the third
and subsequent false alarms pursuant to the following schedule:
 
Number of Excessive False Alarms Fee
3rd                              $25.00
4th                              50.00
5 or more                        100.00
   (b)   Such violations shall continue for each successive false alarm until
the calendar year has elapsed. Each calendar year the record shall be cleared
and the next false alarm shall be deemed the first false alarm.
   (c)   As used in this section, a “particular location” means a property or a
group of contiguous or noncontiguous properties, whether or not under common
ownership, which are under a common street address, both as to house or
building number and street name.
   (d)   The charges stated in this division shall be due and payable by the
alarm user upon receipt of the invoice.
(Ord. 04-203. Passed 12-13-04.)
   717.99  PENALTY.
   (a)   If any alarm system produces three or more false alarms in any
calendar year the civil penalty prescribed in Section
717.05 shall be assessed to the alarm user. Failure to pay this civil penalty
within thirty days of receipt shall be a minor misdemeanor.
   (b)   Each violation of Section
717.05(a) shall be a minor misdemeanor.
   (c)   If the offender has previously been convicted of a violation of any
section of this chapter, each subsequent violation of this chapter shall be a
fourth degree misdemeanor.

difference.

(Ord. 00-261. Passed 9-25-00.)
   919.09 LOCATION OF FACILITIES.
    (a)    Grantee shall construct, place and install its facilities as set
forth in its application and so as to not interfere with travel and proper use
of streets, alleys, and other public ways and places by the public and to not
interfere with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners who
adjoin any of the said streets, alleys or other public ways and places.
Grantee's use of the rights-of-way shall be secondary to the use thereof by the
traveling public (including pedestrians and other proper public uses). Damage
to and repair of pedestals, vaults, manholes or other facilities of the grantee
in the rights-of-way caused by street plowing, street cleaning and other
activities carried out by the City to facilitate such travel and public use
shall be the responsibility of the grantee and no claim may be made against the
City in respect thereto.
   (b)    In all sections of the City where the cables, wires, or other like
facilities of public utilities are placed underground, grantee shall place its
cables, wires or other like facilities underground.
   (c)    Grantee shall construct, place and install its facilities so that
cables, wires, poles and other facilities shall conform to the pattern of the
existing public utility cables, wires, poles and other facilities and to
minimize any damage, destruction or disturbance of the rights-of-way (including
trees, shrubbery and improvements located thereon).
   (d)    Grantee shall relocate, either overhead or underground, its cables,
wires, poles or other facilities when the City determines that such relocation
is necessary for public travel upon and use of the rights-of-way.
(Ord. 00-261. Passed 9-25-00.)
   919.10  RESTORATION OF RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
   In case of damage, destruction or disturbance of any street, sidewalk,
alley, public way, paved area, tree lawn or other portion of the rights-of-way
(including trees, shrubbery, and improvements thereon) by grantee, grantee
shall, without delay and at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved
by the City Engineer, replace and restore such street, sidewalk, alley, public
way, paved area, or portion of the rights-of-way (including trees, shrubbery,
and improvements thereon) to its former state of usefulness, repair and
condition, paved, seeded, mulched, replanted, or sodded in a manner and with
the same type, quality, and condition of materials that will match those
damaged, destroyed or disturbed and those of the adjacent property so that
disturbed area is in as good a condition as before the work involving such
disturbance was done. In the event grantee, after ten (10) days advance notice,
fails or refuses to commence, pursue and complete such replacement and
restoration work, the City shall have the authority, but not the obligation, to
complete such restoration and to require grantee to pay to the City the cost of
such restoration. In the event that the restoration of the disturbed area, or
the area adjacent thereto, deteriorates at a faster rate than that which would
have occurred had grantee not damaged, destroyed or disturbed the area, then in
that event, grantee shall repair, replace, or restore such areas to their
original condition prior to the disturbance. Any such deterioration occurring
within the five (5) year period following the disturbance will be presumed to
result from grantee's actions and disturbance of the area. Any trees in the
disturbed area or the area adjacent thereto that die within said five (5) year
period will be presumed to have died as a result of grantee's actions and
disturbance of the area.
(Ord. 00-261. Passed 9-25-00.)
   919.11  RELOCATION OF FACILITIES.
   If the City shall elect to alter or change the grade of any street,
sidewalk, alley or other public way, or to change the location of or engage in
the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or repair of any public property,
structure or facility, or to engage in any public improvement, and if as a
result thereof it is deemed necessary by the City for grantee to move,
relocate, change, alter or modify any of its facilities or structures in order
to assure the public's unencumbered continued use of the rights-of-way for
travel and other proper public uses, then in such event and upon reasonable
written notice of not less than sixty (60) days, grantee at its sole cost shall
promptly move, relocate, change, alter or modify its facilities. In the event
grantee, after such notice, fails or refuses to commence, pursue and complete
such relocation work within a reasonable time, the City shall have the
authority, but not the obligation, to move, remove, relocate, change, alter,
modify or abate such structures or facilities and to require grantee to pay to
the City the cost of such relocation, alteration, or modification. In the event
of an emergency which threatens the health or safety of the public requires the
relocation, alteration, or removal of the facilities, the City will attempt to
notify promptly the grantee and Grantee shall have the right to move, alter, or
remove the facilities from the rights-of-way.
(Ord. 00-261. Passed 9-25-00.)
   919.12  TEMPORARY MOVEMENT OF FACILITIES.
   Grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit
issued by the City, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving
of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of
wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and grantee shall have
the authority to require such payment in advance. Grantee shall be given not
less than ten (10) business days advance notice to arrange for such temporary
wire changes.
(Ord. 00-261. Passed 9-25-00.)
   919.13 TREE TRIMMING.
   Subject to grantee's compliance with the requirements and restrictions of
Chapter
917 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, grantee shall have the authority to
trim trees upon and overhanging streets, alleys, sidewalks, and public ways and
places of the City so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in
contact with the wires, cables and equipment of the grantee, except that at the
option of the City, such trimming may be done by it or under its supervision
and direction at the expense of the grantee.
(Ord. 00-261. Passed 9-25-00.)
   919.14  JOINT PLANNING AND COOPERATION.
    (a)    Grantee shall cooperate with other grantees and the City for the
best, safest, most efficient, most aesthetic and least obtrusive use of the
rights-of-way, to minimize traffic and other disruptions including street cuts,
and to achieve the most efficient utilization of, construction in and occupancy
of the rights-of-way. Grantee shall not be required to divulge trade secrets or
other competitively sensitive confidential information the release of which
would cause material injury to the grantee. Any confidential information of a
grantee in the possession of the City will be treated as such, to the extent
determined legally appropriate by the City's Law Director.
   (b)    Grantee shall participate in all joint planning conferences called by
the City to discuss construction projects and other matters impacting the
rights-of-way. Such participation may be by telephone if suitable arrangements
are made in advance.
   (c)   Grantee shall cooperate with other grantees in utilization of,
construction in and occupancy of private rights-of-way within the City, but
only to the extent the same is consistent with the grant thereof, is not
additionally burdensome to any property owner or unreasonably burdensome to the
grantee; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to
require expenditure of funds or rearrangement of facilities by a grantee
without fair compensation.
(Ord. 00-261. Passed 9-25-00.)
   919.15 ERECTION AND COMMON USE OF POLES AND DUCTS. 
    (a)    Where utility poles, underground conduit or ducts or other wire-
holding structures or facilities already exist and are reasonably available for
use by the grantee, grantee shall use such poles, conduits, ducts, structures
or facilities to install its cable, wires, and equipment. Where such poles,
conduits, ducts, structures, or facilities are not reasonably available, the
grantee shall have the right to construct, install, erect and maintain its own
poles, conduits, ducts, structures or facilities at locations as it may find
necessary for the proper construction, operation or maintenance thereof. Such
poles, conduits, ducts, structures or facilities shall be identified and set
out in the drawings submitted with grantee's application submitted under
Section
919.06 hereof and City approval of the grantee's application shall constitute
its approval of the construction, installation and erection of those identified
poles, conduits, ducts, structures and facilities. Grantee shall comply with
such conditions as the City may impose in approving the application and
granting any final authorization to so construct, install, locate and erect the
poles, conduits, ducts, structures or facilities.
   (b)    Grantee shall make available to other attaching parties any usable
space on its poles or in its underground structures on the same terms and
conditions as other grantees make space available on their poles or in their
underground structures. Where the City or a public utility serving the City
desires to make use of the conduit, ducts, poles or other wire-holding
structures of the grantee, but agreement therefore cannot be reached, if the
City Commission determines that the use would enhance the public safety or
convenience and would not unduly interfere with the grantee's operations, the
Commission may require the grantee to permit such use on the same terms and
conditions as other grantees make space available in their conduit or ducts or
on their poles or structures. (Ord. 00-261. Passed 9-25-00.)
   919.16 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.
    (a)    Grantee shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall construct,
install, place, locate and maintain its facilities using commonly accepted
methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents which are likely to
cause damage, injuries, or nuisances to the public.
    (b)    Grantee shall construct, install, place, locate and maintain its
facilities in such manner that they will not interfere with any installations
of the City or other grantees, and in accordance with good engineering
practices and, where applicable, the requirements of the National Electrical
Safety Code, the rules and regulations of the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and all applicable ordinances
and regulations of the City affecting electrical and structural installations
which may currently be in effect or changed by future ordinances, and all other
applicable state or federal construction and safety requirements.
   (c)    Grantee's facilities in, over, under, and upon the streets,
sidewalks, alleys, and public ways or places of the city, wherever situated or
located, shall at all times be kept and maintained in a safe, suitable,
substantial condition, and in good order and repair.
   (d)    Grantee shall at all times maintain a force of available employees or
agents sufficient to provide safe, adequate, and prompt maintenance and repair
of its facilities. Such employees or agents shall perform all work,
construction, maintenance or removal of structures and facilities within the
rights-of-way, including tree trimming, in accordance with good engineering,
construction and safety practices, including any applicable safety codes.
   (e)    Grantee shall register, or cause to be registered, its facilities
with the Ohio Utility Protection Service or any successor thereto.
   (f)    Grantee shall cooperate with the City in any emergencies involving
the rights-of- way.
   (g)    Grantee shall field identify, using distinct identification, its
facilities constructed, installed, placed or located in the rights-of-way. Such
identification shall be consistent with industry standards for such
identification.
    (h)    Grantee shall designate a single point of contact for reporting of
emergencies and conditions affecting the safety of the public.
(Ord. 00-261. Passed 9-25-00.)
   919.17  MAPS.
   Upon request of the City, grantee shall provide and maintain with the City a
true and accurate map or set of maps showing the location of all grantee's
facilities in the rights-of-way and other public places. (Ord. 00-261. Passed
9-25-00.)
   919.18  INDEMNIFICATION.
    (a)    Grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the City, its officers, boards, commissions, agents and
employees, against and from any and all claims, demands, causes of actions,
suits, proceedings, damages, liabilities, penalties and judgments of every kind
arising out of or pertaining to the City's granting a rights-of-way
construction permit to grantee and/or the construction, maintenance or
operation of grantee's facilities, including but not limited to damages for
injury or death, or damages to property, real or personal, and against all
liabilities to others and against all loss, cost and expense, resulting or
arising out of any of the same.
   (b)    Grantee shall pay all expenses incurred by the City in defending
itself with regard to the claims, causes of action, suits, proceedings,
damages, liabilities, penalties and judgments mentioned in subsection (a)
above. These expenses shall include but are not limited to all out-of- pocket
expenses, such as attorney's fees, and shall also include the reasonable value
of any services rendered by the City's Law Director or his assistants, or any
employees of the City.
   (c)    For the City to assert its rights to be defended, indemnified and
held harmless, the City must:
(1)   Notify grantee of any claim or legal proceeding which gives rise to such
right;
(2)   Afford grantee the opportunity to participate in any compromise,
settlement, resolution or disposition of such claim or proceeding; and
(3)   Cooperate in the defense of such claim and make available to grantee all
such information under its control reasonably relating thereto.
         (Ord. 00-261. Passed 9-25-00.)
   919.19 NO RECOURSE.
   (a)    Except as expressly provided in this chapter, grantee shall have no
recourse whatsoever against the City for any loss, cost or expense, or damages
arising out of the provisions or requirements of this chapter or the rights-of-
way construction permit, or because of the enforcement thereof by the City, or
for the failure of the City to have the authority to grant all of any part of
the rights-of-way construction permit.
    (b)    Grantee shall acknowledge, upon executing and accepting a rights-of-
way construction permit, that it does so relying upon its own investigation and
understanding of the power and authority of the City to grant such a permit.
   (c)    Grantee shall further acknowledge, upon executing the rights-of-way
construction permit, that it has carefully read the terms and conditions of
this chapter and the form of the rights-of-way construction permit, and grantee
is willing to and does accept all of the risks of the meaning of the terms and
conditions contained therein, and agrees that in the event of any ambiguity or
in the event of any other dispute over the meaning thereof, the same shall be
construed strictly against grantee and in favor of the City.
(Ord. 00-261. Passed 9-25-00.)
   919.20 LIABILITY INSURANCE AND BONDS.
   (a)    Grantee shall maintain, throughout the period of construction and for
so long as the facilities constructed, placed, installed or located occupy the
rights-of-way or other public place, liability insurance insuring the City and
the grantee with regard to all damages of the type mentioned in Section
191.18 above, or otherwise, in the following minimum amounts, (which insurance
or the limits of same however, shall not serve to limit the grantee's
obligations or duties to indemnify and save the City harmless as provided
herein, particularly in Section
191.18 hereof):
(1)   One million dollars ($1,000,000) for bodily injury or death to any one
person;
(2)   Three million dollars ($3,000,000) for bodily injury or death resulting
from any one accident or occurrence;
(3)   Five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for property damage to any
single property; and

coverage.
   (b)    Grantee shall furnish to the City certificates of insurance
evidencing grantee's compliance with this section. All insurance required by
this chapter shall be and remain in full force and effect for the entire term
of this chapter. Such insurance, if canceled for any reason, shall immediately
be put back in force subject to the terms and requirements specified herein.
   (c)    Any insurance policy obtained by the grantee to comply with this
section must be approved by the City's Law Director, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, and a certificate of insurance and a duplicate copy
of said insurance policy, along with written evidence of payment of required
premiums, shall be filed and maintained with the City Clerk during the term of
this chapter. Such insurance may be changed from time to time to reflect
changing liability limits as may be reasonably requested by the City, but not
below the minimum established herein. Grantee shall immediately notify the City
in writing of any litigation that may develop that would affect the insurance
required herein.
    (d)    Upon acceptance of the rights-of-way construction permit, grantee
shall deposit with the City a surety bond in the amount of fifty thousand
dollars ($50,000) in a form reasonably acceptable to the City's Law Director;
provided, however, that the City Manager, in his sole discretion, may waive or
reduce the amount of the bond. The performance bond shall be available to
insure the faithful performance by grantee of all provisions of the rights-of-
way construction permit. The performance bond shall be maintained at fifty
thousand dollars ($50,000) during the entire term of this chapter, regardless
of withdrawals which may be made under this section. The performance bond shall
be conditioned upon and insure the faithful performance of grantee of all terms
and conditions of the rights-of-way construction permit and the payment by
grantee of any claim, liens, costs, expenses and taxes due the City which arise
by reason of the construction, repair or maintenance of grantees' facilities in
the rights-of-way or other public place. The rights reserved to the City with
respect to the performance bond are in addition to all other rights the City
may have under this chapter or any law. The company providing such bond must be
licensed to do business in the State of Ohio. In the event of a default by
grantee in any of its obligations under the rights-of-way construction permit
which default is not cured within ten (10) days after notice by the City to
grantee of such default (or such longer time as it is necessary to cure, so
long as grantee commences to cure within ten (10) days and diligently pursues
cure), the City may levy on the performance bond upon notifying grantee of the
amount of such charge. Grantee may contest in good faith any dispute with
respect to any levy by the City on the performance bond. The rights reserved to
the City with respect to the performance bond are in addition to all other
rights of the city, at law or in equity. The performance bond provided
hereunder shall contain the following endorsement:
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled without
thirty (30) days advance written notice to the City of Sandusky, Ohio."
   (e)    Upon written request of the grantee, and approval of the City
Manager, grantees who maintain a net book value in excess of fifty million
dollars ($50,000,000) may self-insure and self-bond in lieu of maintaining and
providing the policies of insurance and bonds described above. Such grantees
shall provide to the City Manager such certificates or other documents
attesting to such book value, insurance and bonding as the City Manager may
reasonably request.

criteria for discharge, the City Engineer, and/or other duly authorized
employee of the City may require:
      (1)   Best Management Practices (BMPs) to be implemented to reduce
pollutants of concern to acceptable levels prior to discharge to the public
sewer system. BMPs will be specific to the business sector as an alternative to
demonstrating compliance with a numerical local limit; or
      (2)   One or more of the options for discharge in Section
933.20(c) for compliance with a local limit.
   (e)   Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided by the user when
in the opinion of the Engineer, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing floatable grease; or any flammable wastes, sand or
other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required
for private living quarters or dwelling units.
   (f)   No user shall increase the use of potable or process water in any way
for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in this
chapter.
   (g)   Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this chapter.
Where necessary, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the user's cost and expense.

      (1)   Applicable Categorical Standards promulgated by the U.S. EPA shall
be included by reference as part of the limitations defined in subsection (a)
hereof.
      (2)   An application for modification of any National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard may be considered for submittal to the Regional
Administrator by the City when:
         A.    The POTW meets the consistent removal criteria defined in 40 CFR
403.7(a); and
         B.    Sufficient data is obtained in accordance with 40 CFR 403.7(c).
All information necessary to apply for a modification shall be obtained by the
user(s), at no cost to the City.
      (3)   Any changes to this section shall include a reasonable time
schedule for compliance. Such time schedule may not exceed two years except
under unusual circumstances and only after approval of the Engineer.
   (i)   The Engineer may issue orders to any user to require compliance with
any requirements under this chapter including applicable Federal Standards,
other discharge limits and/or reporting requirements. (Ord. 15-140. Passed 10-

   (b)   All disclosure forms shall be signed according to subsection (k)
hereof.
   (c)   The City shall evaluate the complete disclosure form and data
furnished by the user and may require additional information. Within thirty
days after full evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, the City shall
notify the user of the City's acceptance thereof.
   (d)   Industrial users shall notify the City, no later than thirty days
prior to any change or proposed change in production or processes which would
effect the user's wastewater discharge or in advance of any substantial change
in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge, including the
listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the industrial user has
submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p).
   (e)   (1)   Those existing industrial users which become categorical due to
the promulgation of a new categorical standard shall be required to resubmit to
the POTW portions of their disclosure forms as required by baseline monitoring
reporting (BMR) requirements in 40 CFR 403.12(b), within 180 days after the
effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard or 180 days after the
final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission
under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later.
      (2)   When additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance
activities are placed into operation, the user shall revise the disclosure
declaration required in subsection (a) hereof. Specifically, the user shall
provide the data and information required in subsections (a)(3) and (10)
hereof.
   (f)   Where additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance
activities are required to comply with this chapter, the user shall provide
within ninety days upon notification by the City, a declaration of the shortest
schedule by which the user shall provide such additional pretreatment and/or
implementation of additional operation and maintenance activities. In no event
shall the schedule exceed two years.
      (1)   The schedule shall contain milestone dates for the commencement and
completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of
additional pretreatment required for the user to comply with the requirements
of this chapter including, but not limited to, dates related to hiring an
engineer, hiring other appropriated personnel, completing preliminary plans,
completing final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing
construction, completing construction and all other acts necessary to achieve
compliance with this chapter.
      (2)   Under no circumstance shall the City permit a time increment for
any single step directed toward compliance which exceeds nine months.
      (3)   No later than fourteen days following each milestone date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress
report to the City, including no less than a statement as to whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress represented by the milestone date and,
if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress,
the reason for delay and the steps being taken by the user to return the
construction to the approved schedule. In no event shall more than nine months
elapse between such progress reports to the City.
   (g)   Within 180 days following the date of final promulgation by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency of categorical pretreatment standards, any
industrial user subject to the standard shall submit to the City a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated
substances contained in its discharge. The report shall state whether the
requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional
operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the user
into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements.
This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user, and
certified to by a qualified engineer.
   If additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance activities are
necessary to comply with the categorical standards, a schedule shall be
negotiated in accordance with subsection (f) hereof. The final date on which
additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance activities are
implemented shall be no later than the compliance date established in the final
promulgation of such categorical standards.
   (h)   Final Status Reports. Any user subject to a categorical pretreatment
standard shall submit to the City within ninety days after the final compliance
date of such pretreatment standard, a report containing the following
information and measurement procedures:
      (1)   The measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per
day, to the POTW from each of the following:
         (a)   Regulated process streams; and
         (b)   Other streams as necessary to allow use of the combined
wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e) incorporated herewith as if fully
rewritten;
      (2)   Identify the pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated
process;
      (3)   Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature
and concentration of regulated pollutants in the discharge for each regulated
process. Both daily maximum and average concentration (or mass, where required)
shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations;
      (4)   A minimum of four grab samples, taken within a twenty-four hour
operating period, shall be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide and volatile organics. For all other pollutants, twenty-four hour
composite samples shall be obtained through flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques where feasible. The POTW may waive flow-proportional
composite sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-
proportional sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained
through time-proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of
four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged;
      (5)   Unless an alternate sampling procedure is specified by the City
Engineer, where the flow of the stream being sampled is less than or equal to
950,000 liters per day (approximately 250,000 gallons per day), the industrial
user shall take three representative samples within a two-week period; where
the flow of the stream being sampled is greater than 950,000 liters per day,
the user shall take six representative samples within a two-week period.
      (6)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the industrial user should measure the flows
and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula
of 40 CFR Section 403.6(e), incorporated herewith as if fully rewritten in
order to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an
alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with
Section 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be
submitted to the Control Authority;
      (7)   The City Engineer may allow the submission of a baseline report
which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information
sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
      (8)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place, of
sampling, and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW;
      (9)   The industrial user shall submit a statement, reviewed by an
authorized representative of the industrial user as defined in subsection (k)
hereof and certified to by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O and M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required for the industrial user to meet the pretreatment
standards and requirements.
   (i)   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      (1)   An industrial user shall submit periodic compliance reports when
required in their "Orders of the City Engineer", indicating the nature and
concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are
limited by the pretreatment standards hereof. Cost for the monitoring and
analysis shall be borne by the user.
      (2)   Industries that are required to self-monitor are required to report
to the POTW, a limit violation within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of
that violation. Resampling and submission of those results to the POTW are to
occur within thirty days following the knowledge of the violation.
      (3)   All industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
set forth in this chapter shall submit to the City within ninety days after
commencement of discharge to the City, and thereafter during the months of June
and December, or as specified in the industrial user's wastewater discharge
orders, a report indicating the nature and concentration of prohibited or
regulated substances in the effluent which are limited by the pretreatment
standard, the average and maximum daily flow in gallons of any prohibited or
regulated substances, and a statement that all applicable standards or
requirements of the pretreatment standard are being met on a continuous basis.
The statement shall be signed by the authorized representative of the user.
      (4)   Industrial users with categorical standards that require compliance
with a BMP or pollution prevention alternative shall submit documentation to
determine compliance with the standard when submitting periodic reports.
      (5)   Periodic compliance reports shall be based upon data obtained
through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered
by the report, which data is representative of conditions occurring during the
reporting period. The control authority shall require that frequency of
monitoring necessary to assess and assure compliance by industrial users with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. Grab samples shall be used
for pH, hexavalent chromium, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide,
and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, twenty-four-hour
composite samples shall be obtained through flow-proportional composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority, the
samples shall be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the
alternative sampling shall be documented in the industrial user file for that
facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified in 40 C.F.R. 136 and appropriate USEPA guidance, multiple grab
samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to
the analysis as follows: for hexavalent chromium, cyanide, total phenols, and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in the
laboratory.
      (6)   For periodic compliance reports, the control authority shall
require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by
industrial users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (j)   Any industrial user which experiences an upset in operations or any
and all discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including slug
loading or discharge which places the user in a temporary state of
noncompliance with this chapter shall immediately, upon discovery of the
accidental discharge, inform the POTW by telephone. A documented and verified
bonafide operating upset may be an affirmative defense to any enforcement
action brought by the City against a user for any noncompliance with this
chapter, which arises out of violations alleged to have occurred during the
period of the upset. In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking
to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. A
written follow-up report shall be filed by the user with the POTW and the City
Engineer within five days. The report shall specify:
      (1)   Description of the upset, the cause thereof and the upset's impact
on the user's compliance status;
      (2)   Duration of noncompliance, including exact dates and times of
noncompliance, and if the noncompliance continues, the time by which compliance
is reasonably expected to occur; and
      (3)   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of such an upset or other conditions of noncompliance.
   (k)   Signatory Requirements for Industrial User Reports. All reports
concerning industrial wastes as specified in 40 CFR 403.12 shall include the
certification statement as set forth in Section 403.6(a)(2)(ii) and shall be
signed as follows:
      (1)   By a responsible corporate officer, if the industrial user
submitting the reports required by subsections (e), (g), or (h) hereof is a

operation of the regulated facility, including having the explicit or implicit
duty of making major capital investment recommendations, and of initiating and
directing other comprehensive measures, to assure long-term environmental
compliance with environmental laws and regulations;
            (ii)   Can ensure that the necessary systems are established or
that the necessary actions are taken to gather complete and accurate
information for control mechanism requirements; and
            (iii)   Is assigned or delegated the authority to sign documents in
accordance with corporate procedures.
      (2)   By a general partner or proprietor if the industrial user
submitting the reports required by subsections (g), (i), or (j) hereof is a
partnership or sole proprietorship respectively.
      (3)   By a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in
subsections (k) (1) or (2) hereof, if:
         A.   The authorization is made in writing by the individual described
in subsections (k) (1) or (2) hereof;
         B.   The authorization specifies either an individual or a position
having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility from which the
industrial discharge originates, such as the position of plant manager,
operator of a well or well field superintendent, or a position of equivalent

the company; and
         C.    The written authorization is submitted to the Control Authority.
      (4)   If an authorization under subsection (k) (3) hereof is no longer
accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the
overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental
matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the requirements of
subsection (k) (3) hereof shall be submitted to the Control Authority prior to
or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
   (l)   Slug Control. The POTW may evaluate the need for a plan, device or
structure to control a potential slug discharge at least once during the term
of each significant industrial user's control mechanism or within one year of
being identified as a significant industrial user. If the POTW decides that a
slug control plan is needed, the plan shall contain, at a minimum, the
following elements:
      (1)    Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)    Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)    Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of slug discharges,
including any discharge that would violate a prohibition under Section
933.19 of this ordinance, with procedures for follow-up written notification
within five days;

measures and equipment for emergency response.
         (Ord. 15-140. Passed 10-13-15.)
   933.22 MONITORING REQUIREMENT.
   (a)   Where grease, oil and sand interceptors, pretreatment or flow
equalizing facilities are provided or required for any waters or wastes, they
shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the
owner(s) at the owner's expense.
   (b)   Industries subject to federal specific categorical pretreatment
standards and all other industries when required by the City Engineer shall
have a sampling facility, to be installed by the user, having a suitable
structure together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the
wastes. Such structure, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Engineer. The
structure shall be installed by the owner(s) at his expense and shall be
maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible by authorized agents of POTW
at all times.
   (c)   The City may inspect the monitoring facilities or perform the sampling
and analysis required of any industrial user to determine compliance with the
mandates of this chapter. Costs incurred by the POTW for monitoring and
sampling shall be reimbursed by the industrial user.
   (d)   The City may require industrial users to self-monitor its flow and
analyze its characteristics, to properly define the concentration of various
pollutants and to ascertain compliance with the limits defined in Section
933.20. Cost for all self-monitoring efforts shall be borne by the user.
   (e)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR
Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant
in question, or where the City Engineer determines that the Part 136 sampling
and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed by using validated analytical methods
or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including
procedures suggested by the POTW or other parties, approved by the City
Engineer; location and time to be determined on an individual basis subject to
approval by the Engineer and other regulatory agencies.
   (f)   Any industry monitoring a pollutant more frequently than required by

subject to periodic review and inspections by the City Plumbing Inspector and/
or the City Industrial Waste Inspector.
   (h)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the
user shall notify the control authority within twenty-four hours of becoming
aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis
and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within
thirty days after becoming aware of the violation. Where the control authority
has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the
control authority shall perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it
notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat
analysis. Resampling is not required if:
      (1)   The control authority performs sampling at the industrial user at a
frequency of at least once per month, or
      (2)   The control authority performs sampling at the user between the
time when initial sampling was conducted and the time when the results of the
initial sampling are received.
(Ord. 15-140. Passed 10-13-15.)
   933.23  POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTION.
   (a)   The Utilities Director as director of the POTW shall apply the terms
and conditions of this chapter to all industrial users whose discharges are
introduced into the City's POTW.
   The Engineer, Utilities Director and/or other duly authorized employees of
the City bearing proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to
enter all properties at all reasonable times for the purpose of inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling and testing pertinent to discharge to the
community system in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The City
shall have the right to set up on the property such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
If entry to any property in the City is refused by the occupant thereof, the
Engineer, Utilities Director or duly authorized employee shall request the City
Law Director to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a warrant
authorizing entry.
   (b)   The Engineer, Utilities Director and/or other duly authorized
employees are empowered to obtain information which has a direct bearing on the
kind and source of discharge to the wastewater collection system. If such
information is considered confidential by the industry involved, because the
revelation thereof to the public might result in an advantage to competitors,
it shall be marked "confidential" and shall be kept in a separate file and not
available to the public except as specifically provided herein. Confidential
information shall not be disclosed by the Engineer, Utilities Director and/or
other duly authorized employees to the public or to any other persons except to
employees and officials to the extent necessary for the administration and
enforcement of this chapter. If a request is received to disclose confidential
information, it shall only be released in compliance with applicable State and
federal laws pertaining to trade secrets in force at the time the request is
made.
   Notwithstanding the above, information and data submitted to the City with
respect to the nature and frequency of discharge at the point of discharge
shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without
restrictions upon receipt by the City of a proper request.
   (c)   The Engineer, Utilities Director and/or other duly authorized
employees of the City bearing proper credentials and identification shall be
permitted to enter all private properties through which the City holds a duly
negotiated easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling, repair and maintenance of any portion of
the wastewater facilities lying within such easement. All entries and
subsequent work, if any, on such easement, shall be done in full accordance
with the terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the private
property involved.
(1980 Code 50.25)
   933.24 CHARGES.
   (a)   Commencing on or after January 1, 1978, there is levied and assessed
upon each lot, parcel of land, building, or premises having any sewer
connection into the sanitary sewer system of the City or otherwise discharging
sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids either directly or
indirectly into the City wastewater treatment system, a charge for use of the
system.
   (b)   The users of the system shall be divided into classes. Classes shall
be groups of users for which the wastewater characteristics are approximately
equal and services provided are essentially the same. Initially there shall be
established 2 classes of users, as follows:
(1)   Industrial users - as defined in Section
933.07
(2)   Nonindustrial users - all dischargers to the system not described in
subsection (b)(1) hereof.
   (c)   The Utilities Director may establish additional classes as determined
to be necessary.
   (d)   Charges for wastewater treatment service inside the City shall be paid
by each user connected to the system and shall be computed in accordance with
probable demand a user places on the system and the quantity of wastewater
discharged to the system as measured by the City water meter installed thereon
or by a sewage meter installed on the discharge pipe therefrom (or as estimated
by the City). The cost of installation, operation and maintenance, and any and
all other costs for the meter shall be paid for by the user.
   (e)   When a considerable amount of water delivered to any premises is not
returned to the City's sewage disposal system, the Utilities Director in this
case may establish a special basis upon which the sewage disposal charges to
the premises will be computed, or upon a determination by either the Utilities
Director or the customer that the use of direct metering of sanitary sewage
flow is necessary or is a more equitable method of determining sewage disposal
charges, the Utilities Director shall order the installation of wastewater
meters. The cost of installation, operation, and maintenance, and any and all
other costs for the meter shall be paid for by the user.
(1980 Code 50.26)
   933.25 RATES.
   Each user connected to the City system shall pay charges as prescribed in
this section according to the size of the water meter and the quantity of
wastewater.
   (a)   Meter charge - (minimum) inside City users only: includes 100 cubic
feet of use monthly:

(1980 Code 50.29)
   933.31 REVISIONS.
   On or before September 1 of each year, the City Engineer shall review the
rules, regulations, charges, and fees set forth in this chapter. If changes,
revisions, or modifications are necessary, the City Engineer shall submit to
the City Manager the proposed revisions. If approved by the City Manager, the
changes, revisions, and modifications shall be submitted to the first City
Commission meeting in October for ratification by ordinance. The charge system
contained in Section
933.25 shall be in accordance with the regulations of EPA, which now require:
(a)   The user charges shall result in the distribution of operation,
maintenance, and replacement costs of the treatment works within the
jurisdiction of the city to each user class in proportion to the user's
contribution of the total wastewater loading of the treatment works. Factors
such as strength, volume, and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be
included to ensure a proportional distribution of the costs.
(b)   The charges shall be reviewed annually and revised periodically as
required.
(c)   The user charges shall derive revenue sufficient to meet all costs of
operation, maintenance, and replacement of the system. (1980 Code 50.30)
   933.32  PAYMENTS.
   (a)   All charges under this chapter except those provided for in Section
 933.25(a) shall be payable upon application.
(b)   (1)   Charges and rates as provided for in Section
933.25(a) shall be billed monthly, and payment shall be due as of the date of
billing. All revenue generated through the user charge and billing charge shall
be placed into an operation, maintenance, and replacement account. The revenue
account shall be used exclusively to pay for the operation, maintenance, and
replacement of the treatment works. User charges shall generate sufficient
revenues to cover the cost of operation, maintenance, and replacement of the
system.
(2)   All revenue generated by the capital charges shall be placed into a
capital account and used to pay for the capital costs of the wastewater
treatment works. Use of the capital account revenue is not restricted to the
Wastewater Fund.
(3)   The revenue generated by the user and capital charges by users outside
the City shall be treated in the same manner as the user and capital charge
revenue is treated from inside-City users.
   (c)   Charges for industrial cost recovery shall be made on or before
January 30, following the end of the year.
   (d)   Payments shall be made at the office of the Finance Director or those
other places the Finance Director may designate.
   (e)   Bills not paid by the due date are considered delinquent. Delinquent
notices will be sent to those persons whose accounts are unpaid notifying them
of a final date for payment. If bills remain unpaid at the expiration of this
date, the service covered thereby may be discontinued and shut off without
further notice. The wastewater service will be turned back on when charges are
paid.
   (f)   Any service charge levied by or pursuant to this chapter may be made
on lien upon the corresponding lot, parcel of land, or premises served, and if
the same is not paid within 30 days after it shall be due and payable, it may
be certified to the Auditor of Erie County, Ohio, who shall place the same on
the tax duplicate of the County with the interest and penalties allowed by law,
and be collected as other taxes are collected. (Ord. 96-083. Passed 4-8-96.)
   933.33  ENFORCEMENT AND ABATEMENT.
   (a)   Emergency Suspension. 
      (1)   The Utilities Director may for good cause shown suspend a user's
wastewater treatment service and revoke its orders when it appears to the
Utilities Director that an actual or threatened discharge presents or threatens
an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons,
substantial danger to the environment, interference with the operation of the
POTW or violations of any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter. Any user
notified of the suspension of its wastewater treatment service shall
immediately cease all discharges.
      (2)   In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily
with the suspension order, the Engineer shall take all steps deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damages to the POTW, its receiving streams or endangerment to any individuals.
      (3)    Any user to whom a termination order is directed, upon application
to the Engineer, shall be afforded a hearing before the Industrial Pretreatment
Advisory Board, as soon as possible but no later than twenty days after such
application. Any industrial user which is responsible, in whole or in part, for
imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence to the Superintendent prior to the date of the hearing.
      (4)   Whenever an industrial user has violated or continues to violate
the provisions of subsection (a) hereof, service shall only recommence, at the
user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
      (5)   The Utilities Director may decline to recommence services to any
industrial user which is the subject of a suspension order unless such user
first files with the Utilities Director a satisfactory bond, payable to the
POTW, in a value determined by the Utilities Director to be necessary to
achieve constant compliance.
      (6)   The Utilities Director may decline to recommence services to an
industrial user, unless the industrial user first submits proof that it has
obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair POTW damage
caused by its discharge.
   (b)   Noncompliance Termination. The Utilities Director may seek to
terminate the wastewater treatment services to any user who:
      (1)   Fails to provide accurate information in any application, record,
report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to
this chapter;
      (2)   Fails to factually report significant changes in wastewater
constituents or characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Refuses reasonable access to the user's premises by representatives
of the City for the purpose of inspection or monitoring;
      (4)   Falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate, any
monitoring device or method required under this chapter; or
      (5)   Violates the conditions of this chapter, or any final judicial
order entered with respect thereto.
   (c)   Administrative Adjustment. Whenever the City finds that any user has
engaged in conduct which justifies termination of wastewater treatment services
pursuant to subsection (b) hereof, the City shall serve or cause to be served
upon such user, a written notice either personally or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature of the alleged
violation. Within thirty days after the date of receipt of the notice, the user
shall respond personally or in writing to the City, advising of its position
with respect to the allegations. Thereafter, the parties shall meet to
ascertain the veracity of the allegations and where necessary, establish a plan
for the satisfactory correction thereof.
   (d)   Show Cause Hearing. Where the violation of subsection (b) hereof is
not corrected by timely compliance by means of administrative adjustment, the
City may order any user which causes or allows conduct prohibited by subsection
(b) hereof, to show cause before the Industrial Pretreatment Advisory Board,
why the proposed service termination action should not be taken. A written
notice shall be served on the industrial user by personal service, or certified
or registered mail, return receipt requested, specifying the time and place of
a hearing to be held by the Board regarding the violation, the reasons why the
enforcement action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action and
directing the user to show cause before the Board why the proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served no less
than ten days before the hearing. Service may be made on any agent, officer or
authorized representative of the user. The proceedings at the hearing shall be
considered by the Board which shall then enter an appropriate written
recommendation to the City Commission with respect to the alleged improper
activities of the user. A copy of the Board's written recommendations shall be
served on the industrial user by personal service or certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested. The industrial user may, within ten days of
receipt of such notice, file with the City Commission a written objection to
the Board's recommendations, stating with specificity the grounds for such
objections. The City Commission shall review the Board's recommendation, and if
filed, the industrial user's objection, no sooner than thirty days after
service of the Board's recommendations has been made on the industrial user.
Whenever any industrial user has filed written objections, the industrial user
shall be notified no less than five days before the review by the City
Commission of the date and time of such review. Notice shall be served as
heretofore prescribed.
   (e)   Legal/Equitable Relief. Following the entry of any order by the City
with respect to the conduct of any user contrary to the provisions of
subsections (a) and (b) hereof, the City Law Director may, following the
authorization of such action by the City Commission, commence an action for
appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate local court.
   (f)   Request for Interpretation. Any user or interested party shall have
the right to request in writing from the Industrial Pretreatment Advisory
Board, an interpretation or ruling by the City Engineer on any matter covered
by this chapter and shall be entitled to a prompt written reply. In the event
that such inquiry is made by any industrial user and deals with matters of
performance or compliance with this chapter for which enforcement activity
relating to an alleged violation of subsection (b) hereof is the subject,
receipt of any industrial user's objections as provided by subsection (d)
hereof, shall stay all enforcement proceedings pending receipt of the aforesaid
written reply.
   (g)   Re-establishment of Services. Whenever an industrial user has violated
or continues to violate the provision of subsection (b) hereof or any order or
permit issued hereunder and sewer service has been terminated, service will
only recommence at the user's expense after it has satisfactorily demonstrated
its ability to comply.
   (h)   Public Notice of Violation. The Utilities Director shall annually
review discharge reports submitted and compile a list of industrial users who
were in significant noncompliance, as defined at Section
933.08(m), with applicable pretreatment standards or other pretreatment
requirements, during the previous twelve months, pursuant to 40 CFR Section
403.8(f)(2)(vii) and publish a notice in the largest daily newspaper published
in the City.
(Ord. 15-140. Passed 10-13-15.)
   933.34 RECORDS RETENTION.
   All users subject to this chapter shall retain and preserve for no less than
three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports, correspondence
and any and all summaries thereof, related to monitoring, sampling and chemical
analyses made by or in behalf of any user in connection with its discharge. All
records which pertain to matters which are the subject of administrative
adjustment or any other enforcement or litigation activities brought by the
City pursuant hereto shall be retained and preserved by the user until all
enforcement activities have concluded and all periods of limitations with
respect to any and all appeals have expired.
(1980 Code 50.33)
   933.35 WATER LEAKS NOT DISCHARGED INTO SANITARY SEWER; CHARGES.
   All water that is discharged into a sanitary sewer shall be charged for
whether used or wasted or lost by leakage, except that the City Manager may
make such abatement as seems to him right and proper in case of a water leak,
when it does not appear that the owner or user could be reasonably expected to
know of the water leak, or to have had a fair chance to stop the same. The
reduction shall not exceed one-half of the excess sewer charges.
(1980 Code 50.34)
   933.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Administrative Fine. Notwithstanding any other section of this
chapter, any user who is found to have violated any provision of this chapter,
or permits and orders issued hereunder, shall be fined by the City Engineer in
an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation. Each day
on which noncompliance occurs or continues shall be deemed a separate and
distinct violation. Such assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled
sewer service charge and the Superintendent shall have such other collection
remedies as he has to collect other service charges. Unpaid charges, fines and
penalties shall constitute a lien against the individual user's property.
Industrial users desiring to dispute such fines shall file a request for the
City Engineer to reconsider the fine within ten days of being notified of the
fine. Where the City Engineer believes a request has merit, he shall convene a
hearing on the matter within fifteen days of receiving the request from the
industrial user.
   (b)   Injunctive Relief. Whenever an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter or permit or order issued
hereunder, the Utilities Director, through counsel, may petition the Court for
the issuance of a preliminary or permanent injunction or both (as may be
appropriate) which restrains or compels the activities on the part of the
industrial user. The Superintendent shall have such remedies to collect these
fees as it has to collect other sewer service charges.
   (c)   Civil Penalties.
(1)   Any industrial user who has violated or continues to violate this chapter
or any order or permit issued hereunder, shall be liable to the City for a
civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) plus actual
damages incurred to the POTW per violation per day for as long as the violation
continues. In addition to the above described penalty and damages, the City may
recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses associated
with the enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses.
(2)   The City Law Director shall petition the Court to impose, assess and
recover such sums.
   (d)   Criminal Prosecution.
(1)   Violations generally. Any industrial user who willfully or negligently
violates any provision of this chapter or any orders or permits issued
hereunder shall be fined not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000)
or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.
(2)   Falsifying information. Any industrial user who knowingly makes any false
statements, representations or certifications in any application, record,
report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to
this chapter or wastewater permit, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly
renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter
shall be fined not more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).

   935.01  PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The purpose of this Chapter is to establish technically feasible and
economically reasonable storm water management standards to achieve a level of
storm water quality and quantity control that will minimize damage to property
and degradation of water resources and will promote and maintain the health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Sandusky.
   (b)   This Chapter requires owners who develop or re-develop their property
within the City of Sandusky to:
      (1)   Control storm water runoff from their property and ensure that all
storm water management practices are properly designed, constructed, and
maintained.
      (2)   Reduce water quality impacts to receiving water resources that may
be caused by new development or redevelopment activities.
      (3)   Control the volume, rate, and quality of storm water runoff
originating from their property so that surface water and ground water are
protected and flooding and erosion potential are not increased.
      (4)   Minimize the need to construct, repair, and replace subsurface
storm drain systems.
      (5)   Incorporate storm water quality and quantity controls into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage in the development process.
      (6)   Reduce the expense of remedial projects needed to address problems
caused by inadequate storm water management.
      (7)   Maximize use of storm water management practices that serve
multiple purposes including, but not limited to, flood control, erosion
control, fire protection, water quality protection, recreation, and habitat
preservation.
      (8)   Maintain, promote, and re-establish conditions necessary for
naturally occurring stream processes that assimilate pollutants, attenuate
flood flows, and provide a healthy water resource.
   
   (c)   This Chapter shall apply to all parcels used or being developed,
either wholly or partially, for new or relocated projects involving highways
and roads; subdivisions or larger common plans of development; industrial,
commercial, institutional, or residential projects; building activities on
farms; redevelopment activities; grading; and all other uses that are not
specifically exempted in Section
935.01.
   (d)   Public entities, including the State of Ohio, Erie County, and the
City of Sandusky shall comply with this Chapter for roadway projects initiated
after April 30, 2008 and, to the maximum extent practicable, for projects

non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wet-land flows,
swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than one PPM chlorine), fire
fighting activities, and any other water source not containing Pollutants.
      (2)    Discharges specified in writing by the City of Sandusky as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)    Dye testing (plumbing related) is an allowable discharge, but
requires a verbal notification to the City of Sandusky prior to the time of the
test.
      (4)    The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
   (b)    PROHIBITION OF ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS:
      (1)    The construction, use, maintenance, or continued existence of
illegal connections to the MS4 is prohibited.
      (2)    This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illegal
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
      (3)    A person is considered to be in violation of this Chapter if the
person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4, or allows such
a connection to continue.
         (Ord. 09-070. Passed 8-24-09.)
   941.08 MONITORING OF ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS.
   (a)    Establishment of an Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection
Monitoring Program: The City of Sandusky shall establish a program to detect
and eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4. This
program shall include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls and home
sewage treatment systems; the routine inspection of storm water outfalls to the
MS4, and the systematic investigation of potential residential, commercial,
industrial, and institutional facilities for the sources of any dry weather
flows found as the result of these inspections.
   (b)    Inspection of Residential, Commercial, Industrial, or Institutional
Facilities.
      (1)    The City of Sandusky shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this Chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this Chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
      (2)    Facility operators shall allow the City of Sandusky ready access
to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an
NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional
duties as defined by state and federal law.
      (3)    The City of Sandusky shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's storm water discharge.

install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
      (5)    Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the City of Sandusky and shall not
be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
      (6)    Unreasonable delays in allowing the City of Sandusky access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this
Chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this Chapter.
      (7)    If the City of Sandusky has been refused access to any part of the
premises from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
Chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this Chapter
or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety,
and welfare of the community, then the City of Sandusky may seek issuance of a
search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.
      (8)    Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator.
         (Ord. 09-070. Passed 8-24-09.)
   941.09  REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT, CONTROL, AND REDUCE STORM WATER POLLUTANTS
BY THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge
of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system
or watercourses through the use of structural and non-structural BMPs approved
by the City of Sandusky. Further, any person responsible for a property or
premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-
structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal
separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a
valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with
industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliant with
the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a storm water
pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit.

   943.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Chapter is to:
   (a)   Protect the public potable water supply of the City of Sandusky from
the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating within the
customer's internal distribution system(s) or the customer's private water
system(s) such contaminants or pollutants that could backflow or back siphon
through the service connection into the public water system.
   (b)    Promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections,
actual or potential, between the customer's potable water system(s) and
nonpotable water systems, plumbing fixtures, and sources or systems containing
process fluids.
   (c)   Provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control that will systematically and effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of all potable water systems.
(Ord. 17-169. Passed 9-11-17.)
   943.02 RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)    The responsibility for cross-connection control rest jointly with the
water supplier, the water consumer, and the regulatory agencies. The regulatory
agencies include the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, the Ohio Department
of Commerce, the local health department, and the Building Department. Each has
specific responsibilities and each must carry out its phase of a coordinated
program in order to obtain cross-connection control.
   (b)    Cross-connection control may be divided into two areas of protection.
One is the protection of public potable water system, which is the
responsibility of the Water Services Superintendent. The other is the
protection of the consumer's potable water system, which is the responsibility
of the customer-owner of the premises. The regulatory agencies have the basic
responsibility of promulgating and enforcing laws and regulations for the
protection of both the public potable water system and the consumer's water
system.
   (c)    The Water Services Superintendent shall be responsible for the
protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination
or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or pollutants through the
water service connection. If, in the judgment of said Water Services
Superintendent, an approved containment backflow-prevention assembly is
required at the customer's water service connection for the safety of the water
system, the Water Services Superintendent, or his/her designated agent, shall
give notice in writing to said customer to install such an approved containment
backflow-prevention assembly(s{'}'} at specific location(s) on his/her
premises. The customer shall immediately install such approved assembly(s) at
his/her own expense; and, failure, refusal, or inability on the part of the
customer to install, have tested, and maintain said assembly(s) shall
constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until such
requirements have been satisfactorily met.
   (d)    The Plumbing Inspector and Building Department shall be responsible
for promulgating and enforcing laws and regulations for the protection of both
the public potable water system and the consumer's water system. The protection
shall be from contamination or pollution due to the backflow of contaminants or
pollutants originating from the consumers building, facility or property. If,
in the judgment of the Plumbing Inspector, an approved isolation backflow-
prevention assembly is required in the customer's water system for the safety
of the customers and/or public water system, the Plumbing Inspector and/or his
designated agent shall give notice in writing to said customer to install such
an approved backflow-prevention assembly(s) at specific location(s) on his/her
premises. The customer shall install such approved assembly(s) at his/her own
expense within thirty (30) days from notification of the violation by certified
mail and/or personal delivery.

   943.04 WATER SYSTEM.
   (a)    The water system shall be considered as made up of two parts: the
public water system and the customer's system.
   (b)   The public water system shall consist of the source facilities and the
distribution system, and shall include all those facilities of the water system
under the complete control of the Water Services Superintendent, up to the
point where the customer's system begins, which is the outlet side of the
meter. The water supplier does, however, have the responsibility to protect the
public potable water system and therefore has the authority to require a
containment assembly(s) to be installed inside the building on the consumer's
side of the meter. This device shall not, however, extend the responsibility of
the water supplier to the outlet side of the backflow prevention device. The
consumer will be solely responsible for the line past the outlet side of the
meter and for the installation and maintenance of the backflow prevention
assembly(s) as required by the Water Services Superintendent.

used for the delivery of water from the source to the customer's system.
   (e)    The customer's system shall include those parts of the facilities
beyond the service connection which are used in conveying water from the public
distribution system to points of use.
   (f)    The use of any approved backflow prevention device at the water
service connection does not in any way affect or eliminate the need for
individual fixture devices, or air gaps as required by the Ohio Plumbing Code
(isolation backflow prevention devices), nor shall the presence of an isolation
device necessarily negate the need for a containment device.
(Ord. 17-169. Passed 9-11-17.)
   943.05 POLICY.
   (a)   No water service connection to any premises shall be installed or
maintained where actual or potential cross-connections to the public potable or
consumer's water system may exist unless these cross-connections are controlled
to the satisfaction of the Water Services Superintendent. Service of water to
any premises shall be discontinued by the water supplier if a backflow
prevention assembly required by this Backflow Prevention Ordinance is not
installed, tested, and maintained, or if it is found that a backflow prevention
assembly has been removed or bypassed, or if an unprotected cross-connection
exists on the premises, or if the minimum pressure sustaining method required
pursuant to 943.06 of this Ordinance is not installed and maintained in working
order. Service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are
corrected. Water turn on fee shall be charged pursuant to section
939.10.
   (b)    No person shall install or maintain a connection between a public
water system or consumer’s water system and an auxiliary water system unless
the auxiliary water system, the method connection and the use of such system
have been approved by the Water Services Superintendent and by the Director of
the EPA as required by section 6109.13 of the Revised Code.
   (c)    It shall be the duty of the Water Services Superintendent, or his/her
designee, and Plumbing Inspector to cause surveys and investigations to be made
of industrial and other properties served by the public water supply where
actual or potential hazards to the public water supply may exist. Such surveys
and investigations shall be made a matter of public record and shall be
repeated as often as the Water Services Superintendent or Plumbing Inspector
shall deem necessary.
   (d)    The consumer’s system should be open for inspection at all reasonable
times to authorized representatives of the Water Department and Plumbing
Inspector to determine whether actual or potential cross-connections exist.
When such a condition becomes known, the Water Services Superintendent shall
deny or discontinue service, after reasonable notice to the occupants, to the
premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the
customer has corrected the condition(s) in conformance with state/provincial
and city statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations
adopted pursuant thereto.
   (e)    A fee shall be charged for surveys made by the Water Purveyor or
Plumbing Inspector in accordance with subsection
943.05(b) hereof; said fee to be charged for all non-residential surveys shall
be a rate of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per hour with a minimum of one hour
charge per visit. If additional work is required of City staff going above &
beyond, including work performed after hours those charges shall be billed to
the consumer.
   (f)    It shall be the responsibility of the Water Services Superintendent
or his/her designee to conduct periodic surveys of water use practices on the
consumer's premises to determine whether there are actual or potential cross-
connections through which contaminants could backflow into either his or the
public water system. The consumer shall be responsible for immediately
notifying the Water Purveyor or Plumbing Inspector when actual or potential
cross-connections are discovered. The consumer of the premises is solely
responsible for ensuring that the plumbing inside the buildings is in
compliance with the Ohio Plumbing Code.

or flange on this port shall be destroyed so that a connection cannot be made.
   (b)   Any existing device, previously approved by the Water Services
Superintendent or the Director of the Ohio EPA, shall be exempt from the
requirements of section 6.1, as long as this device will, to the satisfaction
of the Water Services Superintendent, still protect the public water system.
This device will be inspected, tested, and maintained as required by these
regulations. Whenever the existing assembly is moved from the present location,
requires more than minimum maintenance, or when the Water Services
Superintendent finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the
unit shall be replaced by an approved backflow-prevention assembly meeting the
requirements of this section.

installed at a location and in a manner approved by the Water Services
Superintendent, or his/her designee, and at the expense of the water consumer.
Any backflow prevention assembly required by

backflow prevention assembly shall be installed on the service line to the
consumer's water system on the consumer's side of the meter, as dose to the
meter as is practical (often immediately inside the building ), and prior to
any other branch line leading off the main service line. The assembly shall be
installed at the consumer's expense within ninety days from the date of
notification that the assembly is required, unless an agreement is reached
between the consumer and the Water Services Superintendent for an extension.
Should the hazard be deemed high enough, these time periods may be shortened in
order to protect the integrity of the public water system. Failure, refusal, or
inability on the part of the consumer to install said assembly shall constitute
grounds for discontinuing water service to the premises until said assembly has
been properly installed.
   (c)    Pits or vaults shall be of water-tight construction, be located so as
to prevent flooding, and shall be kept free of standing water using a sump and
pump or a suitable drain. The sump or drain shall not be connected to a
sanitary sewer so as to prevent flooding of the pit from reverse flow. An
access ladder and adequate lighting shall be provided to permit maintenance,
inspection, and testing of the backflow device. Pits or vaults may not contain
a reduced pressure principle backflow device. A reduced pressure principle
backflow device must be installed above ground level or floor level, whichever
is higher.
   (d)   On any premises where it has been deemed necessary to install a
backflow prevention assembly, it shall be the consumer's responsibility to have
inspections, tests, and overhauls made on such assembly. All assemblies,
including air gap separations, reduced pressure principle assemblies, double
check valve assemblies, pressure vacuum breakers, and interchangeable
connections shall be inspected upon installation, and at least every twelve
months thereafter. In cases where, in the judgment of the Water Services
Superintendent or the Plumbing Inspector, the hazard is deemed great enough,
inspections and tests may be required more frequently.
   (e)   Inspections of backflow prevention assemblies shall be made at the
expense of the consumer, and shall be performed by the Water Services
Superintendent, or his authorized representative. All tests and overhauls shall
be made at the expense of the water consumer and shall be performed by a
Department of Commerce certified tester/installer, approved by the Water
Services Superintendent on an annual basis.
   (f)   Any backflow prevention assembly found to be defective shall be
repaired, overhauled, or replaced by a Department of Commerce certified tester/
installer at the expense of the water consumer without delay.
   (g)   The water consumer shall be responsible to maintain a complete record
of each backflow preventer on the premises from purchase to date of retirement.
These records shall be submitted to the Sandusky Customer Accounting office on
an annual basis, along with a ten dollar ($10) fee for all residential and
commercial reports.
   (h)    Backflow prevention assemblies shall not be bypassed, made
inoperative, removed, or in any way made ineffective without specific
authorization by the Water Services Superintendent.
(Ord. 17-169. Passed 9-11-17.)
   943.10 BOOSTER PUMPS.
   (a)    Booster pumps that are not intended to be used for fire suppression
shall be equipped with a low-suction pressure cut-off designed to shut off the
booster pump when the pressure in the service line on the suction side of the
pump drops to ten pounds per square inch gauge or less.
   (b)    Booster pumps or fire pumps that are used for fire suppression and
installed after August 8, 2008 shall be equipped with a minimum pressure
sustaining valve on the pump discharge, which throttles the discharge of the
pump when necessary to keep the suction pressure from dropping below ten pounds
per square inch gauge.
   (c)    It shall be the duty of the water consumer to maintain the low
pressure cut-off device and/or minimum pressure sustaining valve, in proper
working order, and to certify to the Water Services Superintendent, at least
once every twelve months that the minimum pressure sustaining method in place
is operating properly.
(Ord. 17-169. Passed 9-11-17.)

   1105.02 PURPOSES.
   This Zoning Code is adopted to promote and protect the health, safety,
convenience, and the general welfare of the community by regulating the use of
buildings or other structures, and land for residence, trade, industry, public
or other purposes; by regulating the area and dimensions of land, yards, and
other open spaces; by regulating and restricting the bulk, height, design,
percent of lot occupancy, and location of buildings; by regulating and limiting
population density; and, to divide the City into districts as may be deemed
best suited to carry out these regulations.
(Ord. 03-071. Passed 3-10-03.)
   1105.03 INTENT.
   This Zoning Code is intended, among other purposes:
(a)   To protect the character and values of residential, business, commercial,
manufacturing, institutional, and public uses, and to insure their orderly and
beneficial development;
(b)   To provide adequate open spaces for light and air; to prevent
overcrowding of the land; to prevent excessive concentration of population;
and, on the other hand, to prevent sparse and uncoordinated development;
(c)   To locate buildings and uses in relation to streets, according to City
plans, in a way that will cause the least interference with, and be damaged
least by traffic movements, and will lessen street congestion and improve
public safety;
(d)   To establish zoning patterns that insure economical extensions for
sewers, water supply, and other public utilities as well as developments for
recreation, schools, and other public facilities;
(e)   To guide the future development of the City so as to bring about the
gradual conformity of land and building uses in accordance with a comprehensive
plan;
(f)   To accomplish the intents and goals set forth in the introduction to the
respective districts or groups of districts.
      (Ord. 03-071. Passed 3-10-03.)
   1105.04  COMPLIANCE.
   All public officials of the City, vested with the duty and authority to
issue legal documents, shall not issue permits or certificates for any building
or use that would result in conflict with provisions of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 03-071. Passed 3-10-03.)
   1105.05  RELATION TO OTHER REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The provisions of this Zoning Code shall not annul existing deed or
plat restrictions, codes, laws, rules, regulations, or permits previously
adopted or issued.
   (b)   Where this Zoning Code is more restrictive as to the use of buildings
or land, or limits the height or bulk of buildings, or requires larger areas
and yards than are required by other deed or plat restrictions, codes, laws,
ordinances, rules, or regulations, this Zoning Code shall govern; and
conversely, other regulations shall govern where they are more restrictive in
nature than this Zoning Code.
   (c)   This Zoning Code shall not be construed as removing or rendering
inoperative, any deed or land restriction formerly established by restrictive
covenants that run with land easements, or other agreements between parties.
(Ord. 03-071. Passed 3-10-03.)
   1105.06  BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
   Buildings for which permits have been issued as of the effective date of
this Zoning Code may be completed if construction is commenced within 90 days
after the effective date and if completed with reasonable diligence,
notwithstanding the fact that construction may not in all respects be in
compliance with the provisions hereof.

and the districts in which they may be permitted, provided the following
standards are fulfilled: all conditions set by the Planning Commission for
specific uses, and a permit is granted by the Planning Commission.

conditional use permit shall not be approved unless it conforms with the intent
of the City of Sandusky Comprehensive Plan and complies with the following
conditions and standards:

use plan or major thoroughfare plan, secondary and local streets, and
pedestrian circulation in the surrounding area;
B.   That the proposed use when located on a local residential street is such
as to generate a minimum of vehicular traffic through residential
neighborhoods;
C.   That the location, design, and operation of the use will not discourage
the appropriate development, or impair the value of the surrounding residential
district.
(2)   Business, Commercial and Manufacturing Districts.
A.   That the proposed use is necessary to serve community needs, and existing
similar facilities located in a more remote district in which the use is
permitted by right, are inadequate;
B.   That the proposed use is not closer than appropriate in the particular
situation to schools, churches, and other places of assembly.
C.   That location size, intensity, and site plan of the proposed use shall be
such that its operation will not be objectionable to nearby dwellings by reason
of noise, smoke, dust, odors, fumes, vibrations, or glare more than is normal,
or as permitted by the performance standards of the district.
D.   That the proposed use will form a harmonious part of the business,
commercial, or manufacturing district, taking into account, among others,
convenience of access and relationship of one use to another.
E.   That the proposed use should be permitted in the next less restrictive
district because of its limited nature, modern devices, equipment, or
improvements;
F.   That the hours of operation and concentration of vehicles in connection
with the proposed use will not be more hazardous or dangerous than the normal
traffic of the district.
(3)   In addition to the above general standards set forth in subsections (b)
(1) and (2) hereof, appropriate specific safeguards, applying to a particular
application may also be specified in the permit.
         (Ord. 03-071. Passed 3-10-03.)
   
   1109.11 DETERMINATION OF OTHER SIMILAR USES.
   Upon application for a use not specifically listed in the use
classifications of that district, a similar main use may be determined by the
Commission, which is in compliance with the following standards:
(a)   The use does not create dangers to health and safety, and does not create
offensive noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare, or other
objectionable influences to an extent greater than normally resulting from
other uses listed in the classification to which it is to be added;
(b)   The use does not create traffic to a greater extent than other uses
listed in the classification to which is to be added;
(c)   In addition to the above general standards, appropriate specific
safeguards, applying to a particular application, may also be specified in the
permit;
(d)   The Planning Commission may revoke the similar main use permit if the
property is not maintained in the manner that would conform to the required
standards.
      (Ord. 03-071. Passed 3-10-03.)

   (a)   A person or a corporation shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree where: any violation of any of the provisions of this Zoning

of zoning violation has been served on the owner agent, lessee or tenant of the

person fails to comply with such order within 72 hours of a receipt of a stop
work order or written notice.

guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree with each day the violation

ruled upon.

constructed, altered, repaired or maintained in violation of provisions of this
Zoning Code, or there is an imminent threat of violation, the City or the owner

the violation may institute and maintain, in addition to any other remedies
provided by law, a suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, for
injunction to terminate or prevent the violation as a public nuisance.

(Ord. 03-071. Passed 3-10-03.)
   1111.06 POWERS OF THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   (a)   Interpretation. The Board shall have the power to interpret the Zoning
Code in such a way as to carry out the intent and objective of the Code.
   (b)   Administrative Review. The Board shall have the power to hear and
decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error in any
order, requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by the Planner or other
administrative official except the Planning Commission, in the interpretation
of the provisions of the Zoning Code.
   (c)   Variances. The Board shall have the power to authorize upon appeal in
specific cases, variances from the provisions or requirements of this Zoning
Code. Variances shall be granted only in such cases where, owing to special
conditions pertaining to a specific piece of property, the literal enforcement
of the provisions or requirements of this Zoning Code would cause an undue
hardship or practical difficulty and where the variance will not cause harm to
adjoining property owners.
   Finding for a variance. When considering a request for a variance, the Board
shall be subject to the powers and limitations previously set forth and further
subject to the required findings set forth in subsections (c)(1) and (2) hereof
depending on the specific type of variance.
(1)   Lot area and setback variance.  No variance to the provisions or
requirements of the Zoning Code, pertaining to lot area or setback shall be
granted by the Board unless the Board has determined that a practical
difficulty does exist or will result from the literal enforcement of the Zoning
Code. The factors to be considered and weighed by the Board in determining
whether a property owner, seeking an area or setback variance, has proved
practical difficulty include:
A.   Whether the variance is substantial;
B.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially
altered or whether adjoining property would suffer a substantial determent as a
result of the variance;
C.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of government
services (i.e. water, sewer, garbage, fire, police or other);
D.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with the knowledge of
the zoning restriction;
E.   Whether the property owner’s predicament can be resolved through some
method other than a variance;
F.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would be
observed and substantial justice done by the granting of the variance;
G.   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return or whether there can
be a beneficial use of the property without a variance; and
H.   Whether the granting of the variance will be contrary to the general
purpose, intent and objective of the Zoning Code or other adopted plans of the
City.
(2)   Other variances. The Board may authorize a variance, other than a lot
area or setback variance, in specific cases, from the strict application of the

   1113.01  INTENT.
   (a)   This Zoning Code and the Zone Map may be amended periodically in order
to keep it abreast of new zoning techniques, as well as when the following
general conditions arise:
(1)   Whenever a general hardship prevails throughout a given district; and
(2)   Whenever a change occurs in land use, transportation, or other
sociological trends, either within or surrounding the community; and
(3)   Whenever extensive developments are proposed that do not comply but would
be in the public interest.
   (b)   Such amendments shall be made in accordance with the legislative
procedures set forth below.
(Ord. 03-071. Passed 3-10-03.)
   1113.02  INITIATION OF CHANGE.
   Whenever the public necessity, general welfare, or good zoning practice
require, the Planning Commission may propose by motion to amend, supplement, or
change these regulations or the zoning district of property within the City. A
proposed change of the Zoning Code or the Zone Map may be initiated by the
Planning Commission, the legislative body, or the owner or agent of an owner of
the property to which the change would apply. If the application is made by a
person other than the owner, it shall be accompanied by a verified statement by
the owner that the person making the application is authorized to make the
application. If initiated by the legislative body, the owner, or agent of the
owner, the amendment shall be referred to the Commission before action is taken
by the legislative body.
(Ord. 03-071. Passed 3-10-03.)
   1113.03  ACTION BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The Planning Commission may at its discretion hold a public hearing.
However, at this level, a public hearing is not required because the Planning
Commission’s approval or denial is to be made solely on the facts and not
testimony. Whether a hearing is held or not, the Planning Commission is
required to make its recommendation and report to the City Commission within
thirty (30) days after the first regular meeting subsequent to the receipt of
the application. If a hearing is held, notice of the time, place, and purpose
of the hearing shall be given by both of the following methods:
(a)   Publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the hearing;
(b)   A printed notice, not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the
hearing, sent to the owners of all property as shown upon the records of the
County Recorder, within three hundred (300) feet of the area proposed to be
changed.
(c)   The Planning Commission may approve or disapprove the amendment, either
in whole or in part, and then submit a recommendation to the legislative body.
In the event the Planning Commission shall fail to act within a thirty (30) day
period, unless time is extended by the legislative body, then lack of action
shall constitute Commission approval of the amendment.
      (Ord. 03-071. Passed 3-10-03.)
   1113.04  ACTION BY LEGISLATIVE BODY.
   (a)   After receiving the above recommendation, or after the thirty (30) day
period of inaction, the City Commission shall set a date for a public hearing.
In a newspaper of general circulation in the City, notice of the time and place
of the meeting shall be given at least thirty (30) days prior to the meeting.
During the thirty (30) day period, the text or copy of the text of the
ordinance, measure, or regulation, and the maps, plans, and reports submitted
by the Planning Commission shall be on file, for public examination, in the
office of the Clerk of the Planning Commission.
   (b)   After the hearing, the legislative body may approve in whole or in
part by majority vote of its entire membership, the recommendations submitted
by the Planning Commission. The legislative body may disapprove or modify the
recommendations by the Planning Commission by a vote of not less than three-
fourths of its entire membership.

(30) days after the date of such adoption unless a referendum petition against
the ordinance shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of Ohio R.C.
731.29-731.41.

   1121.02  ESTABLISHMENT OF REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Any building and any tract of land may be used; and the use of any
building and any tract of land may be changed or extended; and any existing
building may be altered, converted, enlarged, reconstructed, moved, or
maintained, for any use permitted or required by the regulations for the
district in which the building or tract of land is located, or for the uses set
forth in another district if specifically permitted in the district in which
the building or tract of land is located, or for the uses set forth in another
district if specifically permitted in the district in which the building or
tract of land is located, and for no other use.
   (b)   The use, change, extension, alteration, conversion, enlargement,
reconstruction, relocation, or maintenance shall be subject to all area, yard,
height, and all other regulations set forth or referred to for the district in
which the building or tract of land is located, and to all other applicable
regulations of the Zoning Code.
(1980 Code 150.11)
   1121.03  ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONE MAP.
   The aforesaid districts are designated by symbols, and the location and
boundaries of the districts are established on a map entitled “Zone Map of the
City of Sandusky” and the same being referred to as Zone Map No. 96-01. The
Zone Map comprising five sections, a composite, and all notations, schedules,
and other information shown thereon, and all amendments thereto are made a part
of this Zoning Code, and it may be amended in the same manner as any other part
of this Code.
(Ord. 96-056. Passed 2-12-96.)
   1121.04  DISTRICT BOUNDARY LINES.
   The district boundary lines of the Zone Map enclose an area of a designated
district, and generally follow the center lines of streets or alleys, lot
lines, or their extension, provided, however:
(a)   Where a boundary line is shown by dimension or relationship as being
located a specific distance from and parallel to a street line, this distance
shall control, or
(b)   Where a boundary line is shown as adjoining a railroad, it shall, unless
otherwise fixed, be construed to coincide with the nearest boundary line of the
railroad right of way, or
(c)   Where a boundary line is shown along a shore line, it shall be construed
to coincide with the pierhead line, except that where no pierhead line has been
established, the shore line shall control. Any fill, accretion, or island
outside of a shore or pierhead line shall, unless otherwise designated, be
construed to be in the same zone as the nearest adjoining district, however,
(d)   Where a boundary line does not coincide with any of the aforesaid lines,
and where it is not located by dimensions shown on the Map, it shall be
determined by use of the scale appearing thereon. In cases of uncertainty, the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine the exact location.
      (1980 Code 150.13)
   1121.05 ZONING LOT DIVIDED BY DISTRICT BOUNDARY.

   1121.06  ANNEXED TERRITORY.
   All territory which may hereafter be annexed to the City, if already zoned,
shall be continued in its existing zone classification, unless thereafter
amended in conformity with the procedures outlined in this Zoning Code. (1980
Code 150.15)
   1121.07  BUILDING LINES.
   A building line, which is synonymous with a setback line, as defined in this
chapter, may be established, or an existing one amended by making a proper
notation thereof on the Zone Map, and the building line shall be the building
line for the property involved and to which it applies. If there is a conflict
between the building line established for a district and one properly noted on
the Zone Map, the latter shall prevail. (1980 Code 150.16)

zoning lot located only in a district in which it is specifically permitted.
(b)   Conditional uses are certain types of main uses, so classified in the
Zoning Code because of their uncommon characteristics, infrequency of
occurrence, large land area requirements, or because they should not be
permitted in certain locations as a right without special requirements. Such
uses, because of their nature, require approval by the Commission as to the
proper location in relation to adjacent developments and with respect to the
entire community. Procedures for evaluating and approving conditional use
permits are set forth and found in Sections
1123.06,
1129.05, and Chapter
1155.

   Limited Manufacturing and General Manufacturing Districts and their
regulations are established in order to achieve, among others, the following
purposes:
(a)   To provide in an appropriate and convenient district sufficient areas for
manufacturing to promote employment and strengthen the economy of the
community;
(b)   To provide limited manufacturing districts for those products and
processes in which dust, smoke, fumes, glare, odors, or other objectionable
influences can be controlled, and which normally require a large amount of
motor vehicle trucking for transportation of their raw materials and finished
products;
(c)   To provide general manufacturing districts for those products and
processes which involve some dust, smoke, fumes, glare, odors, or other
objectionable influences, but do not create any dangers to the health and
safety of the surrounding neighborhoods, and which normally require access to
rail or water for transportation, as well as motor truck routes;
(d)   To improve the general environment by prohibiting dwellings,
institutions, and public facilities in manufacturing districts, and by the same
act, make land more readily accessible for industry;
(e)   To protect adjacent residential districts by restricting the types of
manufacturing uses in the surrounding areas to only those not creating
objectionable influences beyond their district boundaries, by separating and
insulating them from the most intense manufacturing activities;
(f)   To promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with a well-
considered plan, and to stabilize and enhance property values.

   1145.07 REQUIRED YARDS TO BE MAINTAINED.
   The required yards surrounding an existing building shall not be separated
in ownership from that portion of the lot upon which the building is located,
and no part shall be considered as providing a yard for any other existing
building on the same or an adjacent lot. A yard shall not be reduced to less
than the required dimensions for that district in which it is located by
enlarging an existing building, and a yard of less than the required dimensions
shall not be further reduced. Every required yard shall be open and
unobstructed from the ground upward, except for accessory buildings as set
forth in Section
1145.15, and permitted projections as set forth in Section
1145.16.
(1980 Code 151.28)
   1145.08  FRONT YARDS OF PARTIALLY BUILT-UP BLOCKS.
   Where a building line has not been established, and where 50% or more of the
aggregate street frontage between 2 successive intersecting streets is occupied
by buildings of the type and use permitted in the district before the effective
date of the Zoning Code, the average setback distance of conforming buildings
located within 100 feet on either side of a given lot shall be the minimum
front yard setback for that lot; provided, however, the depth of the front yard
resulting therefrom shall be not less than one-half of the dimensions set forth
in Sections

   1145.11  YARD REGULATIONS; UNIT DEVELOPMENT OF ONE- OR TWO-FAMILY DWELLINGS.
   (a)   Intent. In order to encourage greater attractiveness, flexibility, and
fuller utilization of yard spaces, when a group of 3 or more contiguous one- or
two-family dwellings is designed and developed as a unit, the following planned
variations to the yard regulations may be permitted.
   (b)   Front Yard. The depth of front yards may be varied by increasing or
decreasing the setback, provided the setback is decreased not more than 10 feet
from the established building line, and the average depth of the front yards
for the entire unit development is not less than the minimum depth required for
front yards in the district in which they are located.
   (c)   Side Yards. The width of side yards may be varied by locating the
"service" side of 2 dwellings (kitchens, garages, utility rooms) opposite each
other on adjacent lots, providing the "living" sides (living, sleeping rooms)
are located opposite each other on other adjacent lots. Then the total yard
width for the 2 "service" side yards shall be not less than the total of 2
minimum side yards, and the width for the other 2 "living" side yards shall be
not less than the total of the larger side yards; provided, however, the total
width of the 2 side yards on each lot is not less than that required for the
district.

arrangements of buildings, and greater utilization of open spaces, yard
regulations for multifamily dwellings are established for "single development"
(one M-F building on a lot), and yard regulations are established for locating
several buildings in relation to each other within the interior of a lot of a
"group development" (2 or more M-F buildings on a parcel), not subdivided into
the usual street and lot pattern.
   (b)   Definitions. The following terms are used in this section since the
terms "front," "side," and "rear elevations of buildings" are not appropriate.
(1)   "Main wall" means any exterior wall, generally the longitudinal,
containing all required windows of one or more habitable rooms.
(2)   "End wall" means other exterior walls, generally the transverse, not
containing all the required windows of a habitable room, but which may contain
one such window.

feet, the distance shall be increased 4 inches for each additional foot
opposing main walls overlap.
(2)   Main and end wall relationship. The yard, or distance between an end wall
and a main wall of 2 buildings, if only one story high, facing each other
across an open space, shall be not less than 30 feet.
(3)   End and end wall relationship. The yard, or distance between an end wall
and an end wall of 2 buildings, if only one story high, facing each other
across an open space, shall be not less than 20 feet.
(4)   Walls not overlapping. Where walls of 2 buildings, if only one story
high, do not directly face each other or overlap, the yard, or distance between
their nearest corners, shall be not less than 20 feet.
(5)   Increased story height. Distances between buildings in each of the
preceding relationships shall be increased 2-1/2 feet for each story each of
the buildings exceeds one story.

used for pedestrian walks and passive recreational areas. If, however, yards
between buildings are used for parking areas, driveways, or playgrounds,
distances between buildings shall be increased by the total width of these
intermediary facilities. The site shall be designed so that entrances to all
buildings shall be located not more than 200 feet from any access drive, the
distance to be measured along a pedestrian walk.
   (e)   Approval. Development plans showing the locations of buildings, yards,
driveways, parking areas, recreation areas, and other site improvements for
"group developments" shall be submitted to the Commission, and until found to
comply with the Zoning Code and approved by it, building permits shall not be
issued.
(1980 Code 151.33)

(f) Other Buildings or Uses.
For a specific building or use not scheduled above, the Commission shall apply
the unit of measure of the above schedule deemed to be most similar to the
proposed building or use.
(1980 Code 151.85)
   1149.06  SEPARATE OR COMBINED USE OF FACILITIES.
   (a)   A building containing one use shall provide the off-street parking
spaces as required for the specific use. A building, or group of buildings,
containing two or more uses, operating normally during the same hours, and
which have different off-street parking requirements, shall provide spaces for
not less than the sum of the spaces required for each use, or the spaces
required for a "large unit of development" of business buildings.
   (b)   Institutions, places of amusement or assembly may assume that up to
but not more than fifty percent (50%) of their requirements may be shared in
adjacent parking areas which are accessory to business establishments, and
which normally have different hours of operation.
   (c)   Provided, however, where there is a sharing of facilities by different
owners, there shall be a contract covering a period of time as may be required
by the Commission, and provided further that, should any of the uses be changed
or the facilities discontinued, then the required spaces for the use or uses
remaining shall be provided elsewhere as a condition precedent to the continued
use of the building.
   (d)   Where private or public parking lots, or on-street parking are
available and adequate within the walking distances, as limited herein, the
Commission may modify the requirements set forth in Section
1149.05.
(1980 Code 151.86)
   1149.07  LOCATION OF PARKING FACILITIES.
   (a)   Residential Uses. Enclosed or open parking facilities shall be located
on the same lot as the dwelling served, or within the same block if combined
facilities are provided for several dwellings. Open parking shall be behind the
front of the dwelling served.
   (b)   Institutional, Amusement, and Assembly Uses. Accessory parking
facilities shall be provided on the same lot as the institution or place of
amusement or assembly served; however, where no adjacent land is available,
then the nearest point of the parking lot shall be located within a walking
distance of 100 feet of the entrance of the building.
   (c)   Business Uses. Accessory parking facilities shall be located on the
same lot or adjacent to the business served in a Business or Automobile Parking
District; however, where no adjacent land is available, the nearest point of
the parking lot shall be located within a walking distance of 400 feet of the
building.
   (d)   Commercial and Manufacturing Uses. Accessory parking facilities shall
be located on the same lot as the main use served in a Commercial or
Manufacturing District; however, where no adjacent land is available, the
nearest point of the parking lot shall be located within a walking distance of
400 feet of the use.
(1980 Code 151.87)
   1149.08 ACCESSWAYS TO PARKING AREAS.
   (a)   The location and width of entrance and exit driveways to accessory
parking facilities (except for one-family and two-family dwelling) shall be
planned in such a manner as to interfere as little as possible with the use of
adjacent streets. The center line of an access drive to parking areas having
ten or more spaces shall be more than thirty-five feet from a street
intersection right-of-way line. Parking areas of twenty-four spaces or less
shall have a driveway not less than ten feet wide, those having twenty-five or
more spaces shall have one or two driveways not less than a total width of
twenty feet.
   (b)   The aforesaid location and width regulations shall also apply to
driveways for "drive-in" roadside business.
(1980 Code 151.88)
   1149.09  SURFACE IMPROVEMENTS OF PARKING AREAS.
   (a)   All parking areas and access driveways shall be a paved surface unless
otherwise approved by the Planning Commission. These surfaces shall have
adequate drainage so as not to negatively effect adjoining properties. Water
shall not drain across public roads or walkways. Appropriate bumper guards or
curbs shall be provided, to prevent the location of vehicles within required
setbacks or right-of-ways.
   
   (b)   Landscaping shall be required for all surface parking lots along the
sides immediately adjacent and parallel to streets, sidewalks, alleys, lawns,
and adjoining surface parking lots. Landscape shall include a combination of
hardy canopy trees, shrubbery, and ground cover as follows:
(1)   Shrubbery shall have a minimum height of 12 inches and shall extend the
entire length of the landscaped strip, excluding driveways, alleys, sidewalks,
pedestrian access points and other approved means of landscaping. The
landscaped strip shall not extend into a public right-of- way.
(2)   Canopy trees of at least 2-inch caliper shall not be set apart less than
30-feet on center. Canopy trees may be located within a public right-of-way
with City permission. The species of canopy tree shall be approved by the
Department of Horticultural Services.
(3)   Any area within the landscaped strip not occupied by trees or shrubbery
shall consist of ground cover. Ground cover within a public right-of-way shall
only consist of grass.
(4)   Each landscaped strip shall be at least 3-feet in width.
   (c)   All surface parking lots containing 25 or more parking spaces shall
contain one landscaped island measuring at least 100 square feet for each 25
parking spaces provided or fraction thereof. Each landscaped island shall
contain the following:
(1)   At least one hardy deciduous 2-inch minimum caliper canopy tree.
(2)   The area of the island not occupied by trees shall consist of ground
cover, grass and/or shrubbery.
(3)   The island shall be contained within a poured-in place or pre-cast 6-inch
high concrete curb.
   
   (d)   Landscaping shall be well maintained at all times. In the case that a
tree, shrub, or plant dies, the owner of the property shall have six months to
replace the tree, shrub, or plant.
(Ord. 01-249. Passed 11-26-01.)
   1149.10 SITE ILLUMINATION.
      (a)   Pedestrian and parking areas shall be adequately illuminated
whenever necessary to protect the public safety. Illumination shall be so
designed and located that light sources are shielded from adjoining residential
districts, streets, and night sky, and shall not be of excessive brightness or
cause a glare hazardous to pedestrians or auto drivers. In addition, all
parking lot and wall mounted light fixtures used for the illumination of
parking areas shall be of a fully-shielded design, and shall employ warm toned
(3000K or lower) white light sources, amber light sources, or filtered LED
light sources.
   (b)   Façade and site feature lighting. If façade or landscape lighting is
used, fixtures shall be shielded and directed onto the building façade, site
feature or landscape as to not cause a glare or allow light to project into the
sky. Fixtures shall not be directed toward adjacent streets, roads, or
properties and shall use the minimum amount of light necessary to light the
feature. To the extent practicable, lighting fixtures shall be directed
downward rather than upward. Commercial Amusement (CA) District is exempt from
this requirement.
(Ord. 24-161. Passed 8-26-24.)
   1149.11 OFF-STREET LOADING SPACE.
   (a)   Loading or unloading facilities and standing space shall be provided
for all business, commercial or manufacturing buildings hereafter erected or
altered to such uses, and shall be maintained as long as the building is
occupied, or unless an equivalent number of spaces is provided in conformance
with these regulations, except in the Central Business District, Section
1149.04, and except for buildings less than 12,500 square feet in gross floor
area.
   (b)   For buildings of 12,500 to 25,000 square feet gross floor area, at
least one off-street loading space shall be provided not less than 250 square
feet in area.
   (c)   For buildings over 25,000 square feet gross floor area, and not
exceeding 40,000 square feet in gross floor area, one space shall be provided
at least ten feet wide, thirty-five feet deep, and fourteen feet high; and at
least one additional space shall be provided for each 50,000 square feet or
fraction thereof by which the building exceeds 40,000 square feet of gross
floor area.
(1980 Code 151.91)
   1149.12  APPROVAL.
   (a)   Detailed drawings for site plan review and off-street parking, except
for one- and two-family dwellings or loading facilities, shall be submitted for
approval by the Commission before an application for a building permit is
approved. Drawings shall show the number of spaces and locations, dimensions
and descriptions of all features enumerated in Sections
1149.07 to
1149.11. The Commission may require structural or landscape features, such as
bumper guards, curbs, walls, fences, shrubs, ground cover or hedges, to further
the purposes of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   As a condition to the approval of the plans and drawings referred to
in subsection (a) above, the Commission may require drawings showing plan,
elevation and cross-section views for each industrial and commercial building
to be erected and for each residential building containing ten or more dwelling
units to be erected which are sufficient to display:

      P. & Z.
 1107.01
   1151.01 PURPOSE.
   These regulations are intended to permit nonconforming uses and structures
to continue, but not to encourage their perpetuation. The regulation of non-
conforming development is intended to bring development into conformance with
the Sandusky Planning and Zoning Code and the Comprehensive Plan.
(a)   All nonconforming uses, structures, and lots shall be regulated according
to the provisions of Chapter
1151, except as otherwise provided in the Sandusky Planning and Zoning Code.
(b)   Any lawful uses of buildings or land existing at the effective date of
this Zoning Code may be continued, even though such use does not conform to the
provisions hereof.
(c)   Whenever the use of a building or land becomes nonconforming through an
amendment to this Zoning Code or Map, such use may be continued.
(d)   The existence of a nonconforming use or structure shall not be grounds
for the establishment of additional structures or uses not otherwise permitted
in the district.
(e)   In order to avoid hardship, nothing in this Code shall be deemed to
require a change in plans, construction, or designated use of any building or
upon which actual substantial construction was lawfully begun prior to the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code and upon which actual
building construction has been carried on diligently. Construction is
considered to have started if excavation, demolition, or removal of an existing
building has begun in preparation of rebuilding, and a building permit has been
issued, prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code.
      (Ord. 02-191. Passed 12-9-02.)
   1151.02 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   Discontinuance of Use. Whenever a nonconforming use is discontinued
for more than one (1) year, further use shall be in conformity with the
provisions of this Code. “Discontinued” shall mean voluntary nonuse regardless
of the intent to resume the nonconforming use.
   (b)   Nonexpansion of Use. A nonconforming use of a building shall not be
expanded. A nonconforming use of a building shall not be extended to any other
portion of the building.
   (c)   Substitution of Uses. A nonconforming use of a building may be changed
to another nonconforming use of the same or more restricted classification, as
determined by the Planning Commission. Notification shall be provided to
property owners within three hundred feet (300') of the subject property.
 
   (d)   Nonconforming Use of Land. A nonconforming use of land (where no
building or structure is involved), existing lawfully at the time this Zoning
Code became effective, shall not be expanded or extended in any way, but may
continue for a period of not more than 2 years from the effective date, at the
end of which time the use shall be discontinued or changed to a conforming use.
(Ord. 16-158. Passed 9-26-16.)
   1151.03  SPECIAL RESIDENTIAL OCCUPANCY PERMIT.
   Only for a legal nonconforming residential use, may a special residential
occupancy permit be granted to allow for the re-establishment of a residential,
nonconforming use where a prior legal nonconforming residential use has expired
and the structure still remains. The expired legal nonconforming residential
use may be reinstated provided the following standards are fulfilled and the
Planning Commission grants a permit.
(a)   The proposed residential use shall be harmonious and in accordance with
the intent of the residential district in which it is to be located and other
objectives of this Zoning Code and the Comprehensive Plan.
(b)   The proposed residential use shall be designed, constructed, operated and
maintained so as to be harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the
existing or intended character of the general vicinity and shall not change the
essential character of the same area.
(c)   The proposed residential use shall not be in conflict with existing or
future neighboring uses.
(d)   The proposed residential use shall be served adequately by essential
public facilities and services such as highways, streets, police and fire
protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer services; or
the person or agencies responsible for the establishment of the proposed use
shall be able to provide any service adequately.
(e)   The proposed re-institution of the nonconforming residential use shall
not be detrimental to any existing uses, activities, processes, materials,
equipment or conditions in the neighborhood.
(f)   The cost of improvements to the existing nonconforming building to bring
such structure up the standards established by the City Building Code shall not
be greater than sixty percent (60%) of the value of the building structure. The
Building Official may require that the value of the building be established by
an appraisal submitted by a qualified appraiser.
(g)   The Planning Commission may revoke the special residential use permit if
the property is not maintained in a manner that would conform to the policies
detailed above.
(h)   The initial application shall have a processing fee established by the
City Manager and approved by the City Commission and published in the Index of
Fees maintained by the Community Development Department.
(i)   It is required that the Special Residential Occupancy Permit be annually
renewed. No fee is required for the annual renewal.
      (Ord. 02-191. Passed 12-9-02.)
   1151.04 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   For any district which permits the use of the proposed structure, the
structure may be built on a lot of record. The minimum lot area and width
requirements shall not apply to these lots, however, all required yards shall
be provided. A variance to the required yards may be granted through the action
of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 02-191. Passed 12-9-02.)
   1151.05 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   Where, at the time of adoption of the Zoning Code and designation of zoning
districts, a lawful structure exists which does not meet the requirements
imposed by the existing Zoning Code, such structure may be continued so long as
the structure meets the following conditions:
(a)   A nonconforming structure may continue to be used, maintained, repaired
and structural parts replaced when required to restore to a safe condition. A
residential nonconforming building may be modernized to improve interior
livability.
(b)   No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which
increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof, may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity;
(c)   Should such structure be moved for any reason or distance, it shall
thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located;
(d)   A nonconforming structure may be added to, provided the additions are
made to conform to the yard and height regulations of the district in which it
is located;
(e)   Restoration of Damaged Structures:
(1)   Any structure on a lot existing on or before the effective date of this
Code and which does not conform to the provisions of this Code for the district
in which it is located, and which has been or may hereafter be damaged by fire
or other causes to the extent of less than sixty percent (60%) of its
replacement value at the time of damage may be restored, provided that such
structure, when completed, will not differ in location or size from the
previously existing structure (except to the extent that such difference may be
in greater conformity with this Code) and provided such repairs or
reconstruction are completed within one (1) year of the date of the damage.
However, when the damage or destruction to the structure is to the extent of
sixty percent (60%) or more of its replacement value at the time of destruction
or damage, it shall not be restored except in conformity with the regulations
of the district in which the structure is situated.
(2)   Determination of the replacement value shall be made by three (3)
practicing building construction contractors, one to be appointed by the owner,
one to be appointed by the City, and the third to be selected by mutual consent
of the two (2) parties.
         (Ord. 02-191. Passed 12-9-02.)
   1151.06  NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   A sign legally existing at the time of the passage of this section that does
not conform in use, location, height or size with the regulations of the zone
in which such sign is located, may be allowed to remain and may be maintained
and its structural parts and sign face repaired and replaced.
(Ord. 04-207. Passed 12-27-04.)
   1151.07 NONCONFORMING PARKING FACILITIES.
   A building, existing lawfully at the time this Zoning Code became effective,
but which does not conform with the existing off-street parking or loading
regulations, may be occupied by the existing use or use determined to be
similar to the most recent use, without the parking facilities being made
available. However, any new parking spaces that may be provided shall be in
accord with the development standards set forth in Chapter
1149 and, if the existing building is altered so that there is an increase of
the number of dwelling units, seating capacity, or floor area, or if the use is
changed to a use requiring more off-street parking spaces, then off-street
parking and loading facilities shall be provided at least equal to the number
of spaces required for the entire building or use in accordance with Chapter
1149.
(Ord. 02-191. Passed 12-9-02.)
   1151.08 CERTIFICATES OF NONCONFORMITY.
(a)   (1)   The Division of Planning shall issue a certificate of nonconformity
for legally nonconforming uses and structures if the nonconformity is included
in an inventory of nonconformities created by the City or upon application by
the owner, if the owner can document in detail the extent of nonconforming land
uses, structures, signs, and/or lots or parcels at the time the nonconformity
was established.
(2)   The inventory of nonconformities shall contain the detailed information
that must be contained in a certificate. If there is no inventory, an owner of
a nonconformity can obtain a certificate if he or she can establish the extent
and nature of the nonconformity at the time it was established. The
nonconformity must be in existence at the time the relevant ordinance(s) were
adopted or amended. A nonconformity can be established through photographs,
maps and drawings, and written statements describing the nonconforming use at
the time it became nonconforming. In the case of a transient occupancy use,
annual nonconformity must be proven through the following methods:
documentation of the previous years’ Federal tax return and State tax return
showing income from the property providing transient occupancy and executed
rental agreements from the previous year.
   (b)   A certificate of nonconformity shall describe the nonconforming land
uses, structures, signs, and/or lots or parcels in sufficient detail so that a
reasonable person can determine how the nonconformity is not in compliance with
present or previous land development regulations. A map with drawings, with the
location, height and size of structures and signs, and the area of the
nonconformity shall be attached to the certificate.
   (c)   The City may rely on the description and/or map of a nonconformity in
a certificate of nonconformity in determining whether a nonconformity has been
discontinued, destroyed, changed or expanded.
   (d)   A Certificate of Nonconformity shall not entitle a property owner the
re- establishment of a nonconforming use or reconstruction of a nonconforming
structure. However, it shall serve as a base line record of the nonconformity
when a property owner is requesting to reconstruct or re-establish a
nonconformity.
(Ord. 23-080. Passed 3-27-23.)
   1151.09 BURDEN OF PROOF.
   The burden of establishing that any nonconformity is a legal nonconformity
as defined in this chapter shall, in all cases, be upon the owner of such
nonconformity and not upon the City.
(Ord. 02-191. Passed 12-9-02.)

   1155.01 PURPOSE.
   The PUD District is established to promote progressive development of land
and construction thereon by encouraging planned unit developments to achieve:
   (a)   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and building types and permitting an increased density per acre and
reductions in lot dimensions, yards, building setbacks, and area requirements;
   (b)   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if
permitted as part of the project, more convenience in the location of accessory
commercial uses and services;
   (c)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography
and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation, and prevents
the disruption of natural drainage patterns;
   (d)   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utilities and streets;
   (e)   A development pattern in harmony with the land use, transportation,
and other objectives of the City of Sandusky Comprehensive Plan;
   (f)   The City is prepared to accept a greater population density in
undeveloped areas than that reflected by conventional zoning, provided the
developer can demonstrate that any increment of public cost attributable to
increased densities will be compensated for by the private amenities and public
benefits to be achieved by the plan of development.
      (Ord. 08-038. Passed 4-28-08.)
   1155.02 RELATION TO ZONING ORDINANCE.
   Because of the special characteristics of planned unit developments, special
provisions governing the development of land for this purpose are required.
Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this
Chapter and those of the other Chapters of this Zoning Ordinance or other
Ordinances of the City of Sandusky, the provisions of this chapter shall
prevail. Subjects not covered by this chapter shall be governed by the
respective provisions found elsewhere in this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 08-038. Passed 4-28-08.)
   1155.03 PERMITTED USES.
   Compatible residential, commercial, public and quasi-public uses may be
combined in the PUD District, provided the City Planning Commission and the
City Commission find that the proposed location of the commercial uses will not
adversely affect adjacent property, and/or the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
(Ord. 08-038. Passed 4-28-08.)
   1155.04  ACCESSORY BUILDINGS AND USES.
   (a)   Accessory buildings and uses are permitted provided that such
buildings and uses are customary and incidental to the principal use and are
situated on the same lot as the principal building.
   (b)   For the purpose of regulating accessory buildings and uses, all
residential uses in PUD Districts shall conform to the Residential District
regulations of the Zoning Code in Chapter
1129. (Ord. 08-038. Passed 4-28-08.)
   1155.05 MINIMUM PROJECT AREA.
   There is no minimum project area requirement for a PUD District.
(Ord. 08-038. Passed 4-28-08.)
   1155.06  COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   (a)   A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of the land developed in any planned
unit development project shall be reserved for common open space and
recreational facilities for the residents or users of the area being developed.
   (b)   At the discretion of the Planning Commission, the required amount of
common open space land reserved under a planned unit development shall either:
      (1)   Be held in corporate ownership by owners of the project area for
the use of each owner who buys property within the development; or
      (2)   Be acceptable to the City for dedication as common open space for
parks, recreation, and related uses.
   All land dedicated to the City must meet the Planning Commission’s
requirements as to size, shape, and location. Public utility and similar
easements and rights-of-way for water courses and other similar channels are
not acceptable for common open space dedication to the City unless such land or
rights-of-way are usable as a trail or other similar purpose and approved by
the Planning Commission. The legal responsibility and method of the maintenance
of all open spaces shall be specified by the developer before approval of the
Preliminary Development Plan.
   (c)   Landscaping of open spaces shall be sufficient to provide a park-like
environment and reduce the harshness of bare structures and land. Planted
species shall be of types and sizes to assure a park atmosphere and permanent
survival.
(Ord. 08-038. Passed 4-28-08.)
   1155.07 UTILITY REQUIREMENTS.
   Underground utilities, including telephone and electrical systems, are
required within the limits of all planned unit developments. The City
encourages the location of utility lines in alleys or easements behind
buildings instead of in street rights-of-way whenever possible. Appurtenances
to these systems which can be effectively screened may be exempted from this
requirement if the Planning Commission finds that such exemption will not
violate the intent or character of the proposed planned unit development.
(Ord. 08-038. Passed 4-28-08.)
   1155.08 MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND MAXIMUM HEIGHT REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The following minimum and maximum requirements shall be observed:
 
                                               Maximum Height
                               Density (Not to
Land Use      Minimum Lot Area exceed units /  Number of Stories Height (feet)

   A diversification of lot sizes is encouraged. Lot widths and setbacks may be
varied to allow for a variety of structural designs. Clustering of dwellings is
encouraged. Maintaining waterfront views/vistas for projects close to Sandusky
Bay and Lake Erie is also encouraged.
   (b)   For determining density as shown in the above table, the term
“residential acre” does not include street rights-of-way or common open space.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, every building
abutting the perimeter of the planned unit development shall maintain a
building setback of at least twenty-five (25) feet.

of land which may be devoted to commercial use shall be approved by the
Planning Commission and the City Commission. Commercial buildings and
establishments shall be planned as groups having common parking areas and
common ingress and egress points in order to reduce the number of potential
accident locations at intersections with thoroughfares. Planting screens or
fences shall be provided on the perimeter of the commercial areas abutting
residential areas. The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and
harmonious design of buildings, and for adequate and properly arranged
facilities for internal traffic circulation, landscaping, and such other
features and facilities as may be necessary to make the project attractive and
efficient from the standpoint of the adjoining and surrounding noncommercial

   1155.18  APPROVAL BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   After review of the final development plan, the Planning Commission shall
either approve as presented, approve with the supplementary conditions, or
disapprove the final development plan. The Planning Commission, in its review
of the final development plan, shall determine that the facts submitted with
the application establish that:
   (a)   The proposed development can be initiated within eighteen (18) months
of the date of approval;
   (b)   Each individual unit of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an
environment of sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance
will be provided that such objective will be attained; the uses proposed will
not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but will have a
beneficial effect;
   (c)   The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to
carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate traffic in
such amounts as to overload the street network outside the planned unit
development and the adopted policies of the Planning Commission and the City
Commission;
   (d)   Any proposed quasi-public development can be justified at the
locations proposed;
   (e)   Any deviation from district requirements of conventional Residential
Districts is warranted by the design and other amenities incorporated in the
final development plan;

coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development;
   (g)   The planned unit development is in general conformance with the
comprehensive plan of the City;
   (h)   The existing and proposed utility services are adequate for the
population densities and non-residential uses proposed.
      (Ord. 08-038. Passed 4-28-08.)
   1155.19  MAJOR AND MINOR MODIFICATIONS TO A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Subsequent to the approval of the final development plan by the
Planning Commission, the land included within the site area thereof shall not
be developed or used in any manner whatsoever that is not in conformance with
the approved plan, and no building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be
issued for any building, structure or use on the lands except in conformance
with the approved plan.
   (b)   Any change in an approved final development plan desired by the owner
of the tract of land involved shall be submitted to the Planning Commission.
The Commission shall determine whether the proposed revision is a minor or a
major modification to the PUD and take the following action:
      (1)   A minor modification is a change which does not substantially alter
the overall concept of the planned unit development. Generally, such changes
are limited to small site alterations such as realigning a street, shifting a
setback or slight changes in building designs that do not result in the loss of
open space. Increases of up to five percent (5%) of the total development
density may be determined by the Planning Commission to be minor changes. Minor
modifications shall not involve reductions in required improvements, such as
open space, parking areas, pavement widths, etc. Minor modifications shall be
approved by the Planning Commission but do not require a public hearing;
      (2)   A major modification is a major change which will affect the
general character and overall concept of the PUD, including substantial
relocation or redesign of principal or accessory structures, parking, open
space areas and streets. A major change is involved in density increases in
excess of five percent (5%) of the total development density and/or revisions
affecting the land coverage by building, parking and open space areas. Major
modifications require approval by the Planning Commission after a public
hearing. Notice of the public hearing must be sent to property owners within
300 ft. of the tract of land involved in the PUD and must be published in the
local newspaper of general circulation at least ten (10) days prior to the
public hearing;
      (3)   Upon approval of a revised final development plan as a minor or
major modification, the original final plan shall be considered void and the
revised final plan shall have the same force and effect as if it were the
original plan.

   1157.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. Article XVIII, Section 7, Home Rule and
Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Commission of Sandusky, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows:
   (b)   Findings of Fact. The City of Sandusky has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities,
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Sandusky as identified in Section
1157.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
City of Sandusky.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
      (1)    Flood Insurance Study Erie County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Erie County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective September 1, 2022.
      (2)    Other studies and / or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year or
one percent 1% annual chance floodplain, floodways or delineation of other
areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)    Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio, which has been approved
by the City of Sandusky as required by Section
1157.04(c) Subdivisions and Other New Developments.    
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the office of the Director of Engineering Services, 240
Columbus Avenue, Sandusky, Ohio 44870.
   (g)    Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Sandusky, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability. Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. (Ord. 22-
164. Passed 8-22-22.)
   1157.02 DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.

percent (1%) annual chance flood or the 100-year flood.
   (d)    Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE):  The water surface elevation
of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988,
and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the lowest adjacent natural grade elevation plus the depth
number (from 1 to 3 feet).
   (e)   Basement: Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
   (f)    Breakaway Wall: means a wall that is not part of the structural

Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (p)    Flood Insurance Risk Zones: Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)    Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year or
one percent (1%) annual chance flood in any given year; base flood elevations
are not determined.
      (2)    Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year or one percent (1%) annual chance flood in any given year; base
flood elevations are determined.
      (3)    Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year or
one percent (1%) annual chance flood in any given year; with flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
      (4)    Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year or
one percent (1%) annual chance flood in any given year; flood depths of 1 to 3
feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      (5)    Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year or
one percent (1%) annual chance) flood to be protected from the 100-year or one
percent (1%) annual chance flood by a Federal flood protection system under
construction; no base flood elevations are determined.    
      (6)    Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year or two-tenths
percent (.2%) annual chance flood; areas subject to the 100-year or one percent
(1%) annual chance flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)    Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year or two-tenths percent (.2%) annual chance floodplain.
      (8)    Zone V: Coastal special flood hazard area subject to a 100-year or
one percent (1%) annual chance flood from velocity hazard (wave action); base
flood elevations are not determined.
      (9)    Zone VE: and V1-30: Coastal special flood hazard area subject to a
100-year or one percent (1%) annual chance flood event from velocity hazard
(wave action); base flood elevations are determined.
   (q)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS): The official report in which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (r)    Floodproofing: Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate
flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary
facilities, structures and their contents.
   (s)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator.
   (t)   Floodway:  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (u)   Freeboard:  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate
for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater
than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions,
such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice jams, and the
hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (v)   Historic Structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City of Sandusky’s historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (w)   Hydrologic and Hydraulic Engineering Analysis: An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (x)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC): A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)    Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A comment by FEMA
regarding a proposed project that would, upon construction, affect the
hydrologic or hydraulic characteristics of a flooding source and thus result in
the modification of the existing regulatory floodway, the effective base flood
elevations, or the special flood hazard area. A CLOMR does not amend or revise
effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood
Insurance Studies.
   (y)   Lowest Floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure below the
lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (z)   Manufactured Home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term
"manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the purposes
of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes and
mobile homes as defined in Chapter 4781 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(aa)   Manufactured Home Park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
4781-12-01(K), a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority. Manufactured home
park does not include any tract of land used solely for the storage or display
for sale of manufactured homes. Mean sea level: For purposes of the National
Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or
other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map are referenced.
(bb)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):  The NFIP is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
(cc)    New Construction: Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by
Sandusky and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   For the purposes of determining insurance rates, structures for which the
“start of construction'' commenced on or after the effective date of the
initial FIRM [July 5, 1977], and includes any subsequent improvements to such
structures.
   (dd)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15(A)(2) as any governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
“Agency” does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general’s department, or any court.
   (ee)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (ff)   Registered Professional Architect: A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Revised Code.   
   (gg)   Registered Professional Engineer: A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (hh)   Registered Professional Surveyor: A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ii)   Special Flood Hazard Area: Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, A99 or V,VE. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (jj)   Start of construction: The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (kk)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas or
liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ll)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (mm)   Substantial Improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the

         A.    Each federal agency has a responsibility to evaluate the
potential effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain; to ensure that
its planning programs and budget request reflect consideration of flood hazards
and floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the
policies and requirements of EO 11988.
 
   (k)   Map Maintenance Activities. To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Sandusky's flood maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1157.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;

applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in riverine areas where FEMA has provided base flood
elevations but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
 1157.03 (k)(1)(A).
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the City Manager of
Sandusky, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation / Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Sandusky have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the City
of Sandusky’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of
Sandusky boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
City of Sandusky suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the City of Sandusky has assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
 
   (l)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
 1157.05 , Appeals and Variances.
      (4)    Where an existing or proposed structure or other development is
affected by multiple flood zones, by multiple base flood elevations, or both,
the development activity must comply with the provisions of this ordinance
applicable to the most restrictive flood zone and the highest base flood
elevation affecting any part of the existing or proposed structure; or for
other developments, affecting any part of the area of the development.
 
   (m)    Use of Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Map and/or Flood Insurance
Study Data.
      (1)    Zone A:
         A.    Within Zone A areas designated on an effective FIRM, data from
the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall reasonably utilized as best available
data.
         B.    When all appeals have been resolved and a notice of final food
elevation determination has been provided in a Letter of Final Determination
(LFD), BFE and floodway data from the preliminary FIRM and/or FIS shall be used
for regulating development.
      (2)    Zones AE, A1-30, AH, AO, VE, and V1-30:
         A.    BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIS or FIRM restudy are
not required to be used in lieu of BFE and floodway data contained in an
existing effective FIS and FIRM. However,
            1.    Where BFEs increase in a restudied area, communities have the
responsibility to ensure that new or substantially improved structures are
protected. Communities are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or
FIRM data in instances where BFEs increase and floodways are revised to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
            2.    Where BFEs decrease, preliminary FIS or FIRM data should not
be used to regulate floodplain development until the LFD has been issued or
until all appeals have been resolved.
         B.    If a preliminary FIRM or FIS has designated floodways where none
had previously existed, communities should reasonably utilize this data in lieu
of applying the encroachment performance standard of Section
1157.04( i)(2) since the data in the draft or preliminary FIS represents the
best data available.
      (3)    Zones B, C, and X:
         A.    Use of BFE and floodway data from a preliminary FIRM or FIS are
not required for areas designated as Zone B, C, or X on the effective FIRM
which are being revised to Zone AE, A1-30, AH, AO, VE, or V1-30. Communities
are encouraged to reasonably utilize preliminary FIS or FIRM data to ensure
that the health, safety, and property of their citizens are protected.
 
   (n)   Substantial Damage Determinations. Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Notify owners of substantially damaged structures of the need to
obtain a floodplain development permit prior to repair, rehabilitation, or
reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1157.03( k)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the City Manager of Sandusky and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.    Section
1157.04( i)(1)B, items (1) and (3-5).
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. The extent of
the banks shall be established by a field determination of the “bankfull
stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Sandusky specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
 1157.03 (k)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
      (4)    Development Standards for Coastal High Hazard Areas. The
requirements of Section
1157.04(i)(4) apply to development in coastal high hazard areas designated zone
V or VE on the community’s effective FIRM [and when designated on a preliminary
or final FIRM issued by FEMA under the circumstances provided in Section
1157.03(m)].
         A.    All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
elevated on pilings or columns that may be armored as necessary to withstand
Lake Erie ice forces so that:
            1.    The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member
supporting the lowest floor (excluding the pilings or columns) is elevated to
or above the flood protection elevation, and
            2.    The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto
is anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the
effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building
components.
               a.    Water loading values shall be those associated with the
base flood.
               b.    Wind loading values shall be those defined according to
American Society of Civil Engineers 7-13 Minimum design loads and associated
criteria for buildings and other structures, or current version adopted by Ohio
Board of Building Standards.
               c.    A registered professional engineer or architect shall
develop or review the structural design, specifications and plans for the
construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction to
be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the
provisions of Section
 1157.04 (i)(4)(A)(2)(a & b).
         B.    All new construction and substantial improvements shall have the
space below the lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with
non-supporting breakaway walls, open wood lattice]work, or insect screening
intended to collapse without causing collapse, displacement, or other
structural damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting
foundation system.
            1.    For the purpose of Section
1157.04 (i)(4)(B), a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance
of not less than ten (10) and no more than twenty (20) pounds per square foot.
            2.    Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading
resistance of twenty (20) pounds per square foot (either by design or where so
required by local or state codes) may be permitted only if a registered
professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet all
of the following conditions:
               a.    Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load
less than that which would occur during the base flood; and
               b.    The elevated portion of the building and supporting
foundation system shall not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other
structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting
simultaneously on all building components (structural and non-structural).
Water loading values shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind
loading values shall be those defined according to American Society of Civil
Engineers 7-16 Minimum design loads and associated criteria for buildings and
other structures, or equivalent standard.
               3.    All space enclosed by breakaway walls, open wood
latticework, or insect screening below the lowest floor shall be used solely
for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage.
         C.    The use of fill or redistributed existing fill, placed after the
initial identification of Zones V, VE or V1-30 on the community’s FIRM, for
structural support of buildings is prohibited.
         D.    Alteration of sand dunes that will increase potential flood
damage is prohibited.
         E.    Placement or substantial improvement of manufactured homes must
comply with Section
1157.04 (i)(4)(A) through (E).
         F.    Recreational vehicles must either:
            1.    Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
            2.    Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
            3.    Comply with Section
1157.04 (i)(4)(A) through (E).

   1157.05 APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established.
      (1)   The City of Sandusky Board of Zoning Appeals established under
Chapter
1111 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Sandusky is hereby appointed to
serve as the Appeals Board for these regulations.
      (2)   Records of the Appeals Board shall be maintained by the Clerk of
the Board of Zoning Appeals. A copy of the records of any appeal regarding this
Chapter
1157 shall also be maintained in the Office of the Floodplain Administrator.
   (b)   Powers and Duties.
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1157.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)   Appeal From Any Notice and Order, or Other Official Action of the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (1)   Any person adversely affected by any notice, order or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request a hearing on the
matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file, within
twenty-one (21) days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator’s decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit a report including any and all necessary pertinent
information on which the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the
Clerk of the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal hearing, give notice in writing to parties in
interest, and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after the hearing.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the application for a variance
shall transmit it to the Clerk of the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.    Applications seeking a variance from the Flood Protection
Elevation shall include a specific height (in feet) for the requested variance
from the standard Flood Protection Elevation.
         D.   All applications for variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of Sandusky.
      (2)   Public Hearing for a Variance. At such hearing the applicant shall
present such statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In
considering such variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and
make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
Variances shall only be issued upon:
         L.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         M.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         N.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         O.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         P.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (3)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1157.05(d)(2)A. to K. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Erie County Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 22-164. Passed 8-22-
22.)
   1157.06 ENFORCEMENT.

applicable regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of these
regulations, unless specifically exempted from filing for a development permit
as stated in Section
1157.03(i).
      (2)   Failure to obtain a floodplain development permit shall be a
violation of these regulations and shall be punishable in accordance with
Section
1157.06(c).
      (3)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis of plans and
applications approved by the Floodplain Administrator authorize only the use,
and arrangement, set forth in such approved plans and applications or
amendments thereto. Use, arrangement, or construction contrary to that
authorized shall be deemed a violation of these regulations and punishable in
accordance with Section
1157.06(c).
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines
that there has been a violation of any provision of these regulations, he or
she shall give notice of such violation to the person responsible therefore and
order compliance with these regulations as hereinafter provided. Such notice
and order shall:
      (1)   Be put in writing on an appropriate form;
      (2)   Include a list of violations, referring to the section or sections
of these regulations that have been violated, and order remedial action, which,
if taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of these regulations;
      (3)   Specify a reasonable time for performance;
      (4)   Advise the owner, operator, or occupant of the right to appeal;
      (5)   Be served on the owner, occupant, or agent in person. However, this

the person’s last known mailing address, residence, or place of business, and/
or a copy is posted in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling affected.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties. Violation of the provisions of these
regulations or failure to comply with any of its requirements shall be deemed
to be a strict liability offense, and shall constitute a first degree
misdemeanor. Any person who violates these regulations or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the City of Sandusky. Each day such violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the City of Sandusky from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to
prevent or remedy any violation. The City of Sandusky shall prosecute any
violation of these regulations in accordance with the penalties stated herein.

   1161.06 CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION OF LANDMARKS.
   An object, site or building, which is at least fifty (50) years old, may be
designated for preservation as a landmark site or landmark district if it has
significant character, interest or value as part of the development, heritage,
or cultural characteristics of the City, state, or nation, if it has integrity,
or the ability to convey its significance, and if it falls into one of the
following categories:
   (a)   It is in the location of, or is associated in a significant way with,
a historic event with a significant effect upon the community, city, state, or
nation; or
   (b)   It is associated in a significant way with the life of a person
important in the history of the city, state, or nation; or
   (c)   It is associated in a significant way with a significant aspect of the
cultural, political, or economic heritage of the community, city, state or
nation; or
   (d)   It embodies the distinctive visible characteristics of an
architectural style, or period, or of a method of construction; or
   (e)   It is an outstanding work of a designer or builder; or
   (f)   Because of its prominence of spatial location, contrasts of siting,
age, or scale it is an easily identifiable visual feature of its neighborhood
or the City and contributes to the distinctive quality or identity of such
neighborhood or the City.
   (g)   The Secretary of Interior Standards for Rehabilitation shall be
utilized when applications for Certificates of Appropriateness.
   (h)   The property owner shall indicate consent for the Landmark building,
structure, or site designation.
   (i)   Sixty percent (60%) of the affected property owners must consent to
the proposed Landmark district designation.
      (Ord. 19-041. Passed 3-11-19.)
   1161.07 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)   Certificate of Appropriateness shall be required for all changes to
existing Landmark and Historic buildings, sites, structures and districts.
   (b)   The Landmark Commission delegates to the Planning Department staff the
authority to administratively review and grant a Certificate of Appropriateness
without formal action by the Landmark Commission in the following circumstance:
      (1)   The Landmark Commission grants the authority to approve minor
changes such as, but not limited to, landscaping, fencing, and changes approved
by the State Historic Preservation Office. The Landmark Commission shall have
the ability to rescind the granting of said authority.
      (2)   If the Planning Department does not grant administrative approval
of an application, the applicant may request that the application be referred
to the Landmark Commission and will be considered in accordance with the
application review schedule contained in this section.
      (3)   Any changes that were approved by the Planning Department staff
shall be communicated to the Landmark Commission at their subsequent meeting.
   (c)   The Landmark Commission shall prepare an application form and a list
of the procedures necessary to obtain Certificates of Appropriateness, which
shall be made available to the general public. All applicants must submit
applications to the Sandusky Planning Department.
   (d)   In evaluating applications for changes to Landmark and Historic
buildings, sites or districts, the Landmark Commission shall consider the
following standards created by the U.S. Department of the Interior, including:
      (1)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment;
      (2)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided;
      (3)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken;
      (4)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved;
      (5)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved;
      (6)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence;
      (7)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible;
      (8)   Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken;
      (9)   New additions, exterior, alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment; and
      (10)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (e)   All applications for demolition of existing Landmark and Historic
buildings, sites, or districts shall include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   A report as to the structural soundness of the building prepared by
professionals experienced in preservation and rehabilitation;
      (2)   Estimates of the costs and income for rehabilitation of the
building;
      (3)   Estimates of the costs and income for new development;
      (4)   Valuation of the property;
      (5)   Preliminary development plans.
   (f)   The Landmark Commission shall consider the following factors in
evaluating applications for demolition of existing Landmark and Historic
buildings, sites, or districts:
      (1)   The architectural and historic significance of the building;
      (2)   The significance of the building in contributing to the
architectural or historic character of its surroundings;
      (3)   The economic feasibility of rehabilitation and reuse of the
building;
      (4)   The extent to which the owner sought out alternative uses for the
property;
      (5)   The extent to which the proposed redevelopment implements the goals
of the city’s comprehensive plan;
      (6)   If demolition is necessary due to imminent safety hazards, as
determined in writing by the City’s Building Department or Fire Department.
   (g)   All applications shall be reviewed by the Landmark Commission within
forty-five (45) days after a completed application is submitted, unless the
application is approved pursuant to Section
1161.07(b). The applicant shall be given written notice of the meeting at which
his or her application will be considered. All Certificate of Appropriateness
applications shall be reviewed utilizing the preservation design guidelines, on
file at the Planning Department, as well as the Secretary of Interior Standards
for Rehabilitation. A written notification of the Landmark Commission's
decision will also be sent to each applicant by regular mail.
(Ord. 19-041. Passed 3-11-19.)
 
   1161.08 NATIONAL REGISTER PROCESS.
   In accordance with the National Historic Preservation Amendments Act of
1980, the Landmark Commission shall submit a report to the State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO) regarding the eligibility of each property or
District proposed for nomination to the National Register within the City. This
report shall include the recommendation of the Landmark Commission and the
majority of City Commission. A copy of the report prepared by the Landmark
Commission for SHPO shall be made available for public inspection.
   The Landmark Commission will be involved in the National Register process in
the following manner:
   (a)   The SHPO will forward a copy of completed National Register
nominations with a staff review sheet to the Landmark Commission for all
properties within the City prior to the preliminary review of the nomination
unless the Landmark Commission itself has initiated or reviewed the nomination
prior to submission to the SHPO.
   (b)   Following the initial review by Ohio Historic Site Preservation
Advisory Board (OHSPAB), the State Review Board, and prior to the final review
of the nomination, the Landmark Commission shall inform the SHPO and the
property owner(s) as to their opinion regarding the eligibility of the
property.
   (c)   If the City Commission recommends that a property not be nominated,
the SHPO will so inform the property owner(s), the State Review Board, and the
property will not be nominated unless an appeal is filed with the State
Historical Preservation Officer under the regulations established for the
appeals process which is outlined in 36 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations), Part
60.
   (d)   If either or both the Landmark Commission and the majority of City
Commission agree that the property should be nominated, the nomination will be
scheduled for final review by the Ohio Historic Site Preservation Advisory
Board. If no report is submitted, the nomination will be reviewed within sixty
(60) days. The opinion or opinions of the Landmark Commission and the majority
of City Commission will be presented to OHSPAB for its consideration.
   (e)   The Ohio Historic Site Preservation Advisory Board after considering
all opinions shall make its recommendation to the State Historic Preservation
Officer. Either the Landmark Commission or the majority of City Commission may
appeal the final decision of the SHPO under the aforementioned appeals
procedure.
   (f)   If necessary, the Landmark Commission shall seek assistance of
academics or others from professional disciplines when considering a National
Register nomination.

violated, a person or a corporation shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree where: any violation of any of the provisions of this zoning code
exists in a building or tract of land, and a stop work order or notice of

maintain a written record of such adopted standards, which shall be known as
the “Engineering Design and Construction Standards” and shall make copies
available to the subdivider.
   (c)   Conformance with Plans and Ordinances. Every subdivision shall be
designed and constructed in a manner in conformance with the objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan, in general compliance with the plan for the area in which
it is located, and in conformance with the Zoning Ordinance of the City of
Sandusky.
   (d)   Minimization of Impacts. Every subdivision shall be designed in a
manner, which minimizes to the extent possible the creation of impacts such as
traffic, storm runoff, sanitary waste, or water demand, which exceed the
capacity of the improvements, planned for the area.
(Ord. 02-176. Passed 10-28-02.)
   1183.02  STANDARDS FOR IMPROVEMENT PLANS.
   (a)   The subdivider shall prepare and submit complete Improvement Plans,
which describe the improvements to be constructed. Such descriptions shall be
known as the “Improvement Plans” and shall consist of such drawings, plans,
reports, and other forms of information as the Department of Community
Development and the Department of Engineering Services deem necessary to ensure
compliance with the provisions of the Subdivision Regulations and with the
Engineering Design and Construction Standards.
   (b)   Improvement Plans shall be clearly and legibly drawn. For each
required submittal, the subdivider shall submit to the City Engineer three (3)
reproducible sets of plans and three (3) complete electronic file copies. The
City Engineer shall establish standards for document sizes, drawing scales,
electronic format, and other requirements for Improvement Plans.
   (c)   Improvement Plans shall be prepared under the direction of a
professional engineer who shall sign the plans as evidence thereof.
   (d)   Improvement Plans shall include as applicable, but shall not be

facilities in the subdivision and its surroundings, or for aesthetic benefits.
Drainage shall not create a nuisance on public or private property and shall
comply with all regulations of the Sandusky Building Code.
   (f)   Facilities for the detention of storm water shall be provided where
necessary to control the impacts of increased storm water leaving the site and
with the purposes of:
(1)   Permitting commercial, industrial, and residential development without
increasing the flooding of other lands;
(2)   Limiting and/or reducing the adverse impacts on receiving streams, storm
sewers, and other drainage facilities caused by accelerated runoff due to
development; and
(3)   Providing a basis for design of storm drainage systems on land above or
below undeveloped areas, which will preserve the rights and options of both
contributing and receiving property owners and assure the long-term adequacy of
storm drainage systems.
Storm water facilities shall be designed according to criteria established in
the Engineering Design and Construction Standards. Such criteria shall be
established to ensure that peak discharge flow rates are controlled in
proportion to increased runoff volume, that the peak flow rate or runoff
generated by the critical storm and more frequently occurring storms does not
exceed the peak flow rate or pre-development conditions; and that storms of
less frequent occurrence than the critical storm up to a one hundred year storm
have peak runoff rates not greater than the peak flow runoff rates from the
equivalent storms under pre-development conditions.
   (g)   All requirements of the Flood Control Chapter
1157 shall be met.
(Ord. 02-176. Passed 10-28-02.)

shall be provided within each subdivision.
   (b)   Telephone, natural gas, electric, and street lighting wires, conduits,
and television cables shall be constructed underground except in cases where
the Department of Engineering Services determine that topographic, bedrock, or
underground water conditions would result in excessive costs to the subdivider
or that long-term operational and maintenance costs will be excessive. All
transformer boxes shall be located so as not to be unsightly or hazardous to
the public and in locations approved by the Department of Engineering Services
and Utility Company.
   (c)   All drainage and underground utility installations, which traverse
privately owned property, shall be located in easements approved by the
Department of Engineering Services.
(Ord. 02-176. Passed 10-28-02.)
   1183.14  OVERSIZE AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Where determined by the Planning Commission, in accordance with the
recommendation of the Department of Engineering Services, utilities, pavements,
and other improvements required for the proposed subdivision shall be designed
oversized and with extensions provided to serve nearby land which is an
integral part of the neighborhood service or drainage areas.
   The subdivider shall be required to pay for only that part of the
construction costs for the arterial streets, sewers, or water lines, which
serve the proposed subdivision. The City shall pay the difference between the
cost of required improvements for the proposed subdivision and improvements
required to service the surrounding areas in accordance with a schedule
prepared by the City Engineer as indicated in subsection (b) set forth
hereinafter.
   Upgrade reimbursement shall be subject to availability of duly appropriated
funds. If a subdivider chooses to proceed with construction of upgraded utility
lines after having been advised by the City Finance Director of the
unavailability of duly appropriated funds, the subdivider shall do so at the
subdivider’s risk and no reimbursement shall be due from the City. The decision
of a subdivider to upgrade lines without certification from the City Finance
Director that duly appropriated funds are available for reimbursement shall not
commit the City Commission to any additional or future year appropriation.
   (b)   If streets or utilities are not available at the boundary of the
proposed subdivision, and if the Planning Commission finds that the extension
across undeveloped areas would not be warranted as a special assessment to the
intervening properties or as a municipal expense until some future time, the
subdivider may be required, prior to approval of the final plat, to obtain
necessary assessments or rights-of-way and to construct and pay for such
extensions. Such improvements shall be available for connections by subdividers
of adjoining land.
   (c)   It is hereby determined by the City Commission that such
reimbursements for oversizing and off-site improvements do not constitute a
public works project of the City and, accordingly, are not subject to public
bidding or other requirements or regulations applicable thereto. (Ord. 02-176.
Passed 10-28-02.)
   1183.15 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL; LANDSCAPING; TREES.

approved by the Department of Community Development and the Department of
Engineering Services. Restoration shall include shaping to approved grades and
seeding or planting in a manner to control erosion and to be reasonably
maintained. Any unpaved areas of rights-of-way or pedestrian ways shall be
graded, seeded, and planted as approved by the Department of Community
Development and the Department of Engineering Services. Such landscaping shall
be described in the Improvement Plans. Use of innovative landscaping techniques
is encouraged.
   (c)   Trees. The subdivider shall install trees in the public right-of-way
in conformance with the Engineering Design and Construction Standards. Trees
shall be planted in the curb lawn of each lot and in such a manner as not to
impair visibility at any corner or corners. Species of trees shall be chosen
and trees planted according to the requirements of the ordinances of the City
of Sandusky. Tree installation shall be described in the Improvement Plans.
(Ord. 02-176. Passed 10-28-02.)
   1183.16  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL AREAS.
   Streets constructed within subdivisions created for commercial and
industrial districts shall be so located and designed as to minimize traffic
impacts on local streets serving residential districts and to direct traffic
generated by commercial and industrial activity away from such local
residential streets.
(Ord. 02-176. Passed 10-28-02.)
   1183.17  NATURAL AND HISTORIC FEATURES.
   In subdividing any land, due regard shall be shown for all natural features,
such as tree growth, watercourses, historic spots as listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, wetlands or similar conditions. (Ord. 02-176.
Passed 10-28-02.)
   1183.18  RESERVES AND PUBLIC SITES.
   (a)   Each reserve established within a subdivision shall be so designated

   Whenever any structure in the City has become damaged by fire or
deterioration, the extent of the damage, in the judgment of the Chief of the
Fire Department or the Building Official, exceeds 50% of the value of the
structure, and the structure is judged unsafe and dangerous, the structure

CROSS REFERENCE
      Notice to drain lots, etc. - see GEN.OFF.
521.03
   1335.01 LOT DRAINAGE.
   (a)   Provisions for positive drainage shall be made for each lot or plot
and shall be accomplished in such a manner that a nuisance will not be created
as to public or private property. Regrading shall be done so that existing
natural ground drainage of surrounding area shall not be impeded. The following
standards shall apply:
(1)   All drainage facilities shall be designed to carry surface water to the
nearest practical street, storm drain, or natural watercourse approved by the
City Engineer, Building Official, or other appropriate governmental agency, as
a safe place to deposit such waters. At least 1% grade toward the approved
disposal area will be required for building pads, except as waived by the City
Engineer.
(2)   Downspouts may discharge onto splash blocks or into other devices
provided that no excess water will flow onto adjoining property.
(3)   When a lot or plot is graded to a higher or lower level than the natural
grade on an adjacent property, the owner of such lot or plot shall provide
suitable slopes or retaining walls or other protection on his own property to
preserve the natural slope on surface elevation of such adjacent property, as
approved by the Building Official.
   
   (b)   In addition to the above requirements, the Building Official may
attach such conditions as may be reasonably necessary to prevent creation of a
nuisance or hazard to public or private property. Such conditions may include,
but shall not be limited to:
(1)   Improvement of any existing grading;
(2)   Requirements for fencing of excavations or fills which otherwise would be
hazardous.

CHAPTER 1339
Foreclosed Properties and Buildings
1339.01   Findings and purpose.
1339.02   Definitions.
1339.03   Registry.
1339.04   Registration of properties in default and REO properties.
1339.05   Inspection, maintenance and security requirements.
1339.06   Public nuisance.
1339.07   Severability.
   1339.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   The City of Sandusky finds, determines and declares that:
   (a)   Foreclosed properties and buildings, and properties in the foreclosure
process, that remain vacant and unoccupied for any appreciable period of time
become an attractive nuisance to children, a harborage for rodents, an
increased fire hazard, and an invitation to derelicts, vagrants and criminals
as a temporary residence and as a place to engage in illegal conduct,
frequently including illegal drug-related activity; that unkempt and unsecured
grounds surrounding such buildings invite the dumping of garbage and trash
thereon and the congregation of unauthorized persons who use the property for
illegal activity; that such buildings contribute to the growth of blight within
the City, necessitate additional governmental services and costs, significantly
interfere with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties, and depress
market values of surrounding properties, thereby reducing tax revenues; and
that such buildings accordingly create an unhealthy and unsafe condition
affecting the public and constitute an unreasonable use of property and a
public nuisance.
   (b)   Protection of the public health, safety and welfare requires the
establishment and enforcement of the means by which such nuisance conditions
may be prevented and abated.
   (c)   Vacant properties that are going through or have been through the
foreclosure process are frequently the responsibility of banks, lenders, and/or
servicers.
   (d)   Properties in default and Real-Estate Owned ("REO") properties are at
a greater risk of becoming unmaintained vacant properties than other
properties.
   (e)   Even one vacant property that is not actively and well maintained can
cause blight and crime.
   (f)   It is in the interest of the welfare of neighborhoods in the city that
banks, lenders, and/or servicers which fail to maintain vacant properties that
they own or have an interest in be subject to the imposition of fines.
(Ord. 14-117. Passed 10-14-14.)
   1339.02 DEFINITIONS.

limited to, a servicing company that has contracted with the Beneficiary to
perform duties related to the note secured by a deed of trust, including, but
not limited to, the collection of installment payments on the note and
administration of any default and foreclosure process.
   (c)   "Days" means calendar days.
   (d)   "Evidence of vacancy" means any condition visible from the exterior of
the property that alone or in combination with other existing conditions would
lead a reasonable person to believe that the property is vacant. Such
conditions include, but are not limited to, overgrown and/or dead vegetation;
unmaintained pools or spas; an accumulation of newspapers, circulars, flyers
and/or mail; past due utility notices and/or disconnected utilities; an
accumulation of trash, junk and/or debris; the absence of window coverings such

items consistent with residential habitation; statements by neighbors,
passersby, delivery agents, and/or government employees that the property is

   1343.05 APPEALS.
   Any person, firm or corporation, aggrieved by a decision of the Building
Official or his or her designee regarding the provisions of this Chapter may
appeal such decision to the Housing Appeals Board. The words "the Board" or
"Board", as used in this Chapter, mean the Housing Appeals Board.
   (a)   Appeals. For the purpose of this section, "PERSON" shall include any
entity which owns, leases, holds, or has any interest in commercial or
industrial property in the City. Any person affected by any notice and order
which has been issued in connection with the enforcement of any of the
provisions of this Chapter may request and shall be granted a hearing on the
matter before the Board. The person shall file, in the Office of the Division
of Building Inspection, a written request for the hearing and shall set forth
the name, address, and phone number of the appellant and a brief statement of
the grounds for the hearing and appeal from any order of the Building Official
or his or her designee. Requests shall be filed within ten days after the day
the notice and order is served and shall be accompanied by a deposit of fifteen
dollars ($15.00), which deposit shall be non-refundable. On receipt of the
request, the Division of Building Inspection shall promptly notify the Clerk of
the Housing Appeals Board who shall set a time and place for a hearing before
the Board. The hearing shall be held within a reasonable time after a request
has been filed. At the hearing, the appellant shall be given an opportunity to
be heard and to show cause why the notice and order should be modified or
dismissed, or why a variance should be granted. The failure of the appellant or

the Division of Building Inspection to the appellant. The notice shall be sent
by ordinary U.S. mail at least five days prior to the date of the hearing

specific cases where, on appeal, it clearly appears that, by reason of special
conditions, undue hardship would result from a literal application of any
section of this Chapter. Where undue hardship is clearly demonstrated, the
Board may permit a variance from the applicable section if the structure will
vary only a reasonable minimum from the literal provisions of this Chapter but
will comply with the spirit and intent of this Chapter with respect to
sanitation, safety, and rehabilitation.
   (d)   Decisions. On hearing, the Board may affirm, disaffirm, modify, or
dismiss the notice and order, or grant a variance from the notice and order, by
a majority vote of the members of the Board who are present. Failure to secure
a majority vote of the Board members shall be deemed a confirmation of the
decision of the Building Official or his or her designee. The Appellant and the
Building Official shall be notified in writing of the findings.
   (e)   Records. The proceedings at the hearings, including the findings and
decision of the Board and reasons therefor, shall be summarized in writing and
entered as a matter of public record in the Office of the Division of Building.
The record shall also include a copy of every notice and order issued in
connection with the matter. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Board
may seek relief therefrom in any court of competent jurisdiction as provided by

not preclude the Law Director from instituting an appropriate action in a court
of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful repair or maintenance, to
restrain, correct or abate a violation, to prevent the occupancy of a building,
structure or premises, to require compliance with the provisions of this
Chapter or other applicable laws, ordinances, rules or regulations, or the
orders or determinations of the Building Official or his or her designee, or
the Housing Appeals Board.
   (b)   No person shall violate any provision or fail to conform to any

or fail to comply therewith or with any written notice or written order issued
thereunder.

portion thereof is imminently dangerous to the public or to the occupiers or
users of the building, or unfit for human habitation or occupancy, and if it so
finds the building, structure, or portion to be unsafe, or unfit, it shall make
a written finding of fact and decision, and forward the same to City
Commission, along with a resolution, declaring the building, structure, or

members of City Commission indicating a rejection of the resolution of the
Board of Appeals. If the City Commission fails to reject the resolution within
30 days, the same shall be deemed approved.

(Ord. 23-196. Passed 10-9-23.)
   1359.02 PURPOSE.
   The City Commission, being mindful of the proud history of this community
and of the importance of beauty in the everyday lives of our citizens, declares
as a matter of public policy that the preservation, restoration, rehabilitation
and overall aesthetic improvement of our community are matters of public
necessity involving the health, safety, prosperity and welfare of the people.
In the last decade, the importance of assisting private property owners in
creating a cohesive and attractively designed downtown area has been impressed
upon the public sector. The economic health of an area is reflected by the
appearance of the "heart" of that area, its downtown. Therefore, the purpose of
this chapter is to:
   (a)    Maintain and enhance the distinctive character of the Downtown by
safeguarding the architectural integrity of the various period structures
within it, and to prevent intrusions and alterations within this district that
would be incompatible with this established character.    
   (b)    Maintain and enhance the distinctive character of the properties in
the Downtown by safeguarding the architectural integrity of the various period
structures.
   (c)    Provide for a means of design review for other aspects of community
development within the Downtown area that will be of any assistance in
achieving a more pleasing environment for the residents of and visitors to the
City, as well as prospective businesses and developers.
      (Ord. 23-196. Passed 10-9-23.)
   1359.03 DEFINITIONS.    
   Terms herein follow definitions as established in Chapter
1161 as applicable. The following definitions shall apply only to the
provisions of the Downtown Design Review Regulations:
   (a)    "Applicant" means any owner, owners, person, persons, association,
partnership, or corporation, including governmental bodies, who applies for a
Certificate of Appropriateness in order to undertake any change on property
subject to this chapter.
   (b)    "Property" means any place, building, structure, work of art,
fixture, or similar object, but shall not include real property unless
expressly provided
   (c)    "Landscaping" means only such major landscaping work that is to be on
open tracts of land, parking lots, streets, alleys, and other large open areas,
but not including the planting or arrangement of flowers and plants incidental
to the enhancement of single properties.
   (d)    “Owner” means the owner or owners of record.
      (Ord. 23-196. Passed 10-9-23.)
   1359.04 DOWNTOWN DESIGN REVIEW DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.    
   The Downtown Design Review District boundaries are Sandusky Bay on the
north, Hancock Street on the east, Washington Street on the south, and Decatur
Street on the west. All properties within such boundaries and all properties
fronting on the opposite side of Washington, Decatur, and Hancock Streets are
subject to the regulations of this chapter.
(Ord. 23-196. Passed 10-9-23.)
   1359.05 DESIGN GUIDELINES.    
   The Review Process will use the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for
Rehabilitation, Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1208, and
guidelines as recommended for adoption by the Landmark Commission and formally
adopted by the City Commission.
(Ord. 23-196. Passed 10-9-23.)
   1359.06 DUTIES OF THE LANDMARK COMMISSION FOR DOWNTOWN DESIGN REVIEW.
   Downtown Design Review cases, as necessary, shall be reviewed as agenda
items at regularly scheduled Landmark Commission meetings, as determined by the
Community Development Department., The role of the Landmark Commission in these
cases is to act as an advisory committee to the Community Development
Department regarding problems concerning applications for Certificates of
Appropriateness.
(Ord. 23-196. Passed 10-9-23.)
   1359.07 LIMITATIONS ON ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS, SIGN PERMITS, AND
CERTIFICATES OF ZONING COMPLIANCE.
   No permits which require a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be issued
through otherwise established procedures, under the Zoning Code or Building
Code, within the Downtown Design Review District, except in cases coming under
Section
 1359.13, unless the application for such permit is approved by the Community
Development Department through issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness in
the manner prescribed herein.
   No sign permit shall be issued by the Community Development Department or
through otherwise established procedures for any sign to be erected or placed
within the Downtown Design Review District unless a Certificate of
Appropriateness has been issued for that sign in the manner prescribed herein.
(Ord. 23-196. Passed 10-9-23.)
   1359.08 ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS.    
   When the owner of a property within the Downtown Design Review District
desires to make any change to the exterior of the property other than ordinary
maintenance, and those changes involve construction, reconstruction, or
alteration of any property, structure, tree, sign, area, or object within the
District, including the changing of any exterior color or building material,
such owner or his agent shall first secure a Certificate of Appropriateness
from the Community Development Department, unless such property is exempt in
accord with the exclusions permitted in Section
1359.13. Such exemptions shall be determined by the Community Development
Department.
   Applications for Certificates of Appropriateness shall be filed with the
Community Development Department who shall, prior to issuance of any permits,
review the application for compliance with the preservation design guidelines
as established in
1161.07(g). If the application is acceptable, the Director of the Community
Development Department will approve the Certificate of Appropriateness within a
reasonable timeframe of receipt of the application. If the application is not
acceptable, the Community Development Department will work with the owner of
the property to resolve the problem. If resolution of the problem cannot be
achieved, the items will be heard as part of the agenda of the next regularly
scheduled Landmark Commission meeting.
   Any changes agreed to by the Landmark Commission and the owner shall be in
accordance with the guidelines of the Design Review Process and once consensus
is reached, the Director of the Community Development Department will approve
the Certificate of Appropriateness with conditions or changes noted. A record
of the Certificate of Appropriateness will remain on file in the Community
Development Department.
(Ord. 23-196. Passed 10-9-23.)
   1359.09 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING APPLICATIONS FOR CERTIFICATES OF
APPROPRIATENESS.
   (a)    In considering the appropriateness of any changes, including signs
and tree removal, the Community Development Department shall consider the
following standards created by the U.S. Department of the Interior, including:
      (1)    A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in
a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment;
      (2)    The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided;
      (3)    Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from
other buildings, shall not be undertaken;
      (4)    Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved;
      (5)    Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved;
      (6)    Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence;
      (7)    Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible;
      (8)    Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken;
      (9)    New additions, exterior, alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment; and
      (10)    New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (b)     In considering a demolition request the Community Development
Department shall not be charged with the review of the appropriateness of
demolition in lieu of renovation but shall review the site characteristics and
impacts on adjacent buildings as the result of the demolition.
     Attention shall be paid to the facades of the adjacent structures which
may not have been designed to be exterior elements. It shall be the
responsibility of the property owner doing the demolition to make arrangements
with adjacent property owners to repair, renovate, or replace the facade
treatment affected by the demolition in conformance with the requirements of
subsection (a) hereof.
   The Community Development Department shall also review each demolition for
the impacts said act would have on the site and the proposed use of the site
after demolition. The Community Development Department may require landscaping
in conformance with Section
1359.10 or other such elements to ensure the property relates appropriately to
the immediate vicinity. (Ord. 23-196. Passed 10-9-23.)
   1359.10 LIMITATIONS ON LANDSCAPING.  
   No landscaping, as defined in these Design Review Regulations, shall be
performed in the Downtown Design Review District unless a Certificate of
Appropriateness has first been issued. (Ord. 23-196. Passed 10-9-23.)
   1359.11 EXISTING SIGN LIMITATIONS.    
   Although signs which were in place prior to the passage of this chapter are
not subject to review, if any business they relate to closes, the signs shall
be removed within thirty calendar days of the last day of that business. The
property owner is responsible for applying to the Community Development
Department for a Certificate of Appropriateness for any subsequent treatment of
that space unless it meets the exemptions as defined in Section
1359.13.
(Ord. 23-196. Passed 10-9-23.)
   1359.12 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS REQUIRED FOR NEW SIGNS.
      As has been provided under the provisions of this chapter, a Certificate
of Appropriateness shall be obtained for any new sign an applicant wishes to
erect or place within the Downtown Design Review District. The Certificate of
Appropriateness shall be obtained prior to the issuance of any required sign
permit by the Community Development Department.
(Ord. 23-196. Passed 10-9-23.)
   1359.13 EXCLUSIONS.    
   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any property, area, or object within the Downtown
Design Review District or otherwise listed under the provisions of this
chapter, provided such work involves no change in material, design, texture,
color, or outer appearance; nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to
prevent any change, including the construction, reconstruction, or alteration
of any feature which in the view of the Community Development Department acting
lawfully is required for the public safety because of an unsafe or dangerous
condition.
(Ord. 23-196. Passed 10-9-23.)

   Except as otherwise provided in this Code, any on premise sign or billboard
which is located on property which becomes vacant and unoccupied for a period
of six months or more, or any sign which pertains to a time, event or purpose

   1365.04  DANGEROUS OR DEFECTIVE SIGNS OR BILLBOARDS PROHIBITED.
   No person shall maintain or permit to be maintained on any premises owned or

   1365.06  DISPOSAL OF SIGNS; COSTS; ASSESSMENT; PENALTIES.
   Any sign or billboard removed by the Code Enforcement Official pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter shall become the property of the City and may be
disposed of in any manner deemed appropriate by the City. The cost of removal
of any such sign or billboard by the City shall be considered a debt owed to
the City by the owner of the property, and may be recovered in an appropriate
court action by the City or by assessment against the property as hereinafter
provided. The cost of removal shall include any and all incidental expenses
incurred by the City in connection with the sign's removal, and the notice
procedures set forth herein.
   When it is determined by the Code Enforcement Official that any sign or
billboard poses an imminent danger to the public safety, and contact cannot be
made with the owner thereof or of the property, no written notice shall be
required. In any such situation, the Code Enforcement Official may obviate and
remove the danger, with all costs incident to said procedure being assessed as
contained in the following subsections:
(a)   The notice given by the Code Enforcement Official shall state the
remedial action required to be taken, but shall also state that if such action
is not taken within the time limits set forth in this chapter, the cost of
correcting the unlawful feature of the sign shall be assessed against the
property on which the sign is located, together with the additional five
percent (5%) for inspection and incidental costs and an additional ten percent
(10%) penalty for the cost of collection, and collected in the same manner as
real estate taxes against the property.
(b)   In the event the owner of the premises or person entitled to the
possession, or the owner of the sign fails, neglects or refuses to comply with
the notice to repair, rehabilitate or demolish the sign declared to be
unlawful, the owner of the sign, the owner of the premises upon which the sign
is located and the person entitled to possession thereof, if other than the
owner of the premises, or all or any of them, may be prosecuted for violation
of this chapter. The Code Enforcement Official may remove the sign declared to
be unlawful.
(c)   If it is necessary for the Code Enforcement Official to remove a sign
pursuant to the provisions hereof, bids shall be taken when the estimated costs
of demolition exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00). When completed, the Code
Enforcement Official shall certify to the Clerk the legal description of the
property upon which the work was done, together with the name of the owner
thereof, as shown by the tax rolls of the related municipal area, together with
a statement for work performed, the date of performance and the cost thereof.
(d)   Upon receipt of such statement, the Clerk shall mail a notice to the
owner of the premises as shown by the tax rolls, at the address shown upon the
tax rolls, by certified mail, postage prepaid, notifying such owner that the
work has been performed pursuant to this chapter, stating the date of
performance of the work, the nature of the work and demanding payments of the
costs thereof, as certified by the Code Enforcement Official, together with
five percent (5%) for the inspection and the other incidental costs in
connection therewith. Such notice shall state that if such amount is not paid
within thirty days of mailing the notice, it shall become an assessment upon
and a lien against the property of such owner, describing the same, and will be
certified as an assessment against the property of such owner, together with a
ten percent (10%) penalty, for collection in the same manner as the real estate
taxes upon the property.
(e)   If the Clerk does not receive payment within a period of thirty days
following the mailing of such notice, the Clerk shall inform the City
Commission of such fact and the City Commission shall thereupon enact a
resolution assessing the whole cost of such work, including five percent (5%)
for inspection and other incidental costs in connection therewith upon the lots
and tracts of land from which the sign has been removed, together with a ten
percent (10%) penalty for the cost of collection.
(f)   Following passage of such resolution upon third reading, the Clerk shall
certify the same to the County Auditor who shall collect the assessment,
including the ten percent (10%) penalty of cost for collection, in the same
manner as other taxes are collected.
(g)   Each such assessment shall be a lien against each lot or tract of land
assessed until paid and shall have priority over all other liens except general
taxes and prior special assessments.
(h)   For all purposes hereinafter, the owner of the premises shall be presumed
to be the owner of all signs thereon, unless the contrary shall appeal from
facts brought to the attention of the Code Enforcement Official.
      (Ord. 94-082. Passed 6-13-94.)
   1365.07 APPEALS.
   Any person, firm or corporation may appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals
within ten days, regarding the following determinations by the Code Enforcement
Official:
(a)   Denial of granting a sign permit within thirty days of application.

1111 of the Planning and Zoning Code.

incurred by the City for hazard abatement, repair and/or demolition of vacant

costs. Money collected under this section shall be used exclusively for the
administration and enforcement of this Chapter.
   (b)   But for a valid arms-length transaction, the annual registration fee
for a vacant commercial or industrial building shall be based on the duration
of time the building has been vacant regardless of a change in ownership. The
owner of a vacant commercial or industrial building shall pay an annual
registration fee of four hundred dollars ($400) for the first year the building
remains vacant. For every consecutive year that the building remains vacant,
the annual registration fee shall be assessed at double the previous year’s
registration fee amount for a maximum annual registration fee equaling the five
(5) year registration fee of six thousand four hundred dollars ($6,400) which
shall be the registration fee for the fifth and all consecutive, subsequent
years of vacancy.
      (1)   In the event of a valid arms-length transaction, the new purchaser
would start at the $400.00 first year registration fee and proceed as described
above, regardless of the status of the seller.
         A.   A valid “arms-length transaction” is one between a buyer and
seller in which the buyer and seller are independent of each other and have no
relationship (by blood, marriage, friendship, or related or unrelated business
dealings) to each other, ensuring that all parties in the deal are acting in
their own self interest, are not subject to any pressure or duress from the
other parties, and are dealing from equal bargaining positions.
   (c)   Vacant buildings without an approved Development Plan:
   The registration fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any
building permits. The Fire Chief shall refund the vacant commercial or
industrial building registration fee paid if the subject building is brought
into compliance with standards of the Ohio Building Code and reoccupied within
one year of payment of the annual registration fee. The refund shall be for the
amount of the registration fee paid during the year in which the building was
approved for re-occupancy. Registration fees paid in previous years and/or any
arrearages of registration fees which are paid in the same year in which the
building was approved for re-occupancy shall not be refunded.
   (d)   Vacant buildings with an approved Development Plan:
   The registration fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any
building permits. Beginning January 1, 2017, the Fire Chief shall refund the
vacant commercial or vacant building registration fees paid if the subject
building is brought into compliance with standards of the Ohio Building Code
and reoccupied within the time frame specified in the approved Development
Plan. The refund shall be for the full amount of all registration fees (less
any funds used to maintain the safety and security of the subject building)
paid in the time period after the approval of the Development Plan in
accordance with Section
1505.08. Registration fees paid before January 1, 2017 or if the subject
building is not reoccupied within the time frame specified in the approved
Development Plan shall not be refunded.
   (e)   If a registration form is filed late, an additional late fee shall be
paid in addition to the annual registration fee and shall be equal to the
annual registration fee or one thousand dollars ($1,000) whichever is less.
   (f)   All delinquent registration fees shall be paid by the owner prior to
any transfer of an ownership interest in the vacant commercial or industrial
building.
   (g)   If an owner or person in control of a vacant commercial or industrial
building or a purchaser fails, neglects or refuses to pay a registration fee
within the time ordered pursuant to this section then the Fire Chief shall so
notify the Law Director. The Law Director shall collect this debt as if it were
any other debt owed to the City including but not limited to instituting a
civil action, turning the matter over to a collection agency, or conducting any
other legal means of redress. The unpaid amount shall accrue interest at three
percent (3.0%).
(Ord. 16-165. Passed 10-11-16.)
   1505.06  INSPECTION.
   (a)   At the time of registration the owner or person in control may arrange
for an inspection of the property by the Fire Chief in the presence of the
owner, person in control, or authorized agent of the owner having
responsibility for security and maintenance of the property for the purpose of
determining the structural integrity of the building, that it will be safe for

license is issued. The license shall have particularly and definitely described
therein the nature and extent of the work of blasting to be done thereunder.
The City Manager shall grant the license to any person, firm, or corporation
upon the payment of a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) therefor, and upon the
following conditions:
(a)    The license is sought for the purpose of making lawful improvements, and
all reasonable and necessary precautions will be taken by the licensee; and

resulting to any person or property by reason of any default or neglect upon
the part of the licensee or of any employee, agent or contractor employed by
the licensee, in the work of blasting under the license. The bond shall be
given for a period of one year or if the work requires less time than one year,
until the work to be performed under the license shall have been completed. The
bond shall be approved as to the sureties thereon by the City Manager, and

   If, at the time that an application for a permit under Section

the City Manager considers that a larger bond should be given for the
protection of persons and property against damage or loss by reason of the
amount, kind, and character of the dangers attending the blasting proposed to
be done or being done, he may require the applicant for the permit or permittee
to give bond in a sum not exceeding twenty thousand dollars ($20,000). The bond
shall be conditioned upon the permittee paying any and all damages resulting to
any person or property by reason of any fault or neglect upon the part of the
permittee. The bond shall have a bonding company or two freeholders as sureties
thereon. However, the sureties are approved by the City Commission. The bond
shall be in force and effect until the work designated in the permit has been
completed. In the event that any permittee shall, after a permit has been
issued, neglect or refuse to give an additional bond when required to do so,
the City Manager shall revoke the permit. The City Manager may, however, accept
a policy of liability insurance in lieu of the bond required by this section.
