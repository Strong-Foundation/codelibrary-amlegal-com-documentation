   To provide for the purposes of general Village operations, maintenance, new

at the rate of 1% per annum until January 1, 2001, at which time the rate will
be 2%, upon the following:
   (A)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned by
residents of the Village.
   (B)   On all salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned by
nonresidents of the Village for work done or services performed or rendered in

   (C)   Net profits.
      (1)   On the net profits earned of all unincorporated businesses,
professions, or other activities conducted by residents of the Village.
      (2)   On the net profits earned of all unincorporated businesses,
professions, or other activities conducted in the Village by nonresidents.
      (3)   For the purposes of divisions (C)(1) and (2) of this section, an
association shall be taxed as an entity, on the net profits of the association
derived from work done or services performed or rendered and business or other
activities conducted in the Village, whether or not such association has its

accounting periods commencing on or after January 1, 1991.
      (4)   For the purposes of paragraph (C)(1) above, a resident of the

   (E)   The tax upon all of the income specified in paragraphs (A), (B), (C),

January 1, 2001.
§ 33.03 ALLOCATION OF NET PROFITS.
   (A)   In the taxation of income which is subject to the tax, if the books
and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or profession both within and
without the of the Village shall disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion
of its net profit is attributable to that part of the business or profession
conducted within the boundaries of the Village, then only such portion shall be
considered as having a taxable situs in the Village for purposes of the tax. In
the absence of such records, net profit from a business or profession conducted
both within and without the boundaries of the Village shall be considered as
having a taxable situs in the Village for purposes of the tax in the same
proportion as the average ratio of:
      (1)   The average net book value of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village during the taxable period to the average net book value of all of the
real and tangible personal property owned by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.
      (3)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
   (B)   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
by the Clerk-Treasurer so as to produce such result.
   (C)   As used in this section, SALES MADE IN THE VILLAGE means:
      (1)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Village.
      (2)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village regardless of where title passes even though transported from a
point outside the Village if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitations or promotion.
      (3)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village to purchasers outside the Village regardless of where
title passes if the sale is not generated through solicitation or promotion by
an employee of the taxpayer at the place where delivery is made.
§ 33.04 LEVY OF TAX.
   (A)   The income tax at the rate of 1% shall be levied, collected and paid
with respect to the salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned
on or before December 31, 2000 and with respect to the net profits of
businesses, professions or other activities earned on or before December 31,
2000. The income tax at the rate of 2% shall be levied, collected and paid with
respect to the salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned on
and after January 1, 2001, and with respect to the net profits of businesses,
professions or other activities earned on and after January 1, 2001. Where the
fiscal year of the business, profession or other activity differs from the
calendar year, the tax at the rate of 1% shall be applied to that part of the
net profits for the portion of the fiscal year occurring before January 1,
2001. The tax at the rate of 2% shall be applied to that portion of the fiscal
year occurring on and after January 1, 2001.
   (B)   Where the fiscal year of a business, profession or other activity is
other than a calendar year, in computing the tax, the profits of such taxpayer
shall be determined by dividing the annual profits by 12 and multiplying the
quotient by the number of months of the fiscal year before January 1, 2001, and
multiplying the quotient by the number of months of the fiscal year between
January 1, 2001, and thereafter and applying the appropriate tax rate to each.
§ 33.05 RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (A)   Each taxpayer who engages in business, or whose salaries, wages,
commissions and other compensation are subject to the tax imposed by this
chapter shall, whether or not a tax be due thereon, make and file a return on
or before April 15 of each year with the Clerk-Treasurer on a form furnished by
or obtainable from the Clerk-Treasurer, setting forth the aggregate amount of
salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation earned and/or net profits
earned and/or gross income from such business less allowable expenses in the
acquisition of such gross income earned during the preceding year and subject
to the tax, together with such other pertinent information as the Clerk-
Treasurer may require. Provided, however, that when the return is made for a
fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the return shall
be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the close of
said fiscal year or other period.
   (B)   Commencing with taxable years beginning subsequent to December 31,
1981, the net loss from an unincorporated business activity may not be used to
offset salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation. However, if a
taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable business activities to be included
in the same return, the net loss of one unincorporated business activity
(except any portion of a loss separately reportable for municipal tax purposes
to another taxing entity) may be used to offset the profits of another for
purposes of arriving at overall net profits. A husband and wife in any taxable
year may elect to file separate or joint returns.
   (C)   If a net operating loss has been sustained in any taxable year such
losses may not be carried forward or backward to any other taxable year.
   (D)   Affiliated corporations may not deduct a loss from any other
corporation having a taxable profit. Operations of any affiliated corporation
may not be taken into consideration in computing net profits or the business
allocation percentage formula of another.
   (E)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of the filing thereof,
pay to the City Auditor the amount of taxes shown as due thereon; provided,
however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of §
33.07, or where any portion of said tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of §
33.08, or where an income tax has been paid to another municipality, credit for
the amount so paid in accordance with §
33.12 hereof, shall be deducted from the amount shown to be due and only the
balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of filing said return.
   (F)   A taxpayer who has overpaid his income tax in any taxable year may
request a refund provided, however, there is no other tax liability and
provided, further, that no amount of less than $1 will be refunded or
collected.
   (G)   The Clerk-Treasurer shall have the authority to extend the time for
filing of the annual return provided the request of the taxpayer for extension
is made in writing and received on or before the original due date of the
return. The extension period requested may not exceed six months. The Clerk-
Treasurer may require a tentative return, accompanied by payment of the amount
of tax shown to be due thereon on or before the original due date. No penalty
shall be assessed, in those cases in which the return is filed and the final
tax paid within the period as extended.
   (H)   When the last day for filing a return falls upon a Saturday, Sunday or
federal holiday, the taxpayer shall be permitted to file on or before the first
business day following the Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday without penalty.
§ 33.06 AMENDED RETURN AND REFUNDS FOR OVERPAYMENT.
   (A)   Where an amended return must be filed in order to report additional
income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax overpaid,
subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in §
33.05(E), such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Clerk-Treasurer. A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
   (B)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to the Village
tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (C)   No refund shall be allowed unless a written request be presented to
the Clerk-Treasurer within three years of the date the taxes were due.
§ 33.07 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (A)   Each employer within or doing business within the Village shall deduct
at the time of payment of such salaries, wages, commissions or other
compensation, the tax of 1% (until January 1, 2001 at which time the tax shall
be 2%) of the gross salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation due by
the employer to said employee and shall, on or before the last day of the month
following the close of each calendar quarter, make a return showing the amount
of taxes deducted and a record of payments showing that all taxes deducted
during the quarter have been paid to the Village in accordance with the payment
schedule prescribed by divisions (B)(1), (2) and (3) of this section. The
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and
withheld, whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld. Every employer
or officer of a corporation is deemed to be a trustee for this Village in
collecting and holding the tax required under the ordinance to be withheld and
the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds.
   (B)   Employers shall pay to the Village all income taxes withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld on either a semi-monthly, monthly, or
quarterly basis depending on the amount of taxes involved according to the
following payment schedule:
      (1)   Semi-monthly payments of the taxes deducted are to be made by an
employer if the total taxes deducted in the prior calendar year were $12,000 or
more, or the amount of taxes deducted for any month in the preceding quarter
exceeded $1,000. Such payment shall be paid to the Village within five banking
days after the fifteenth and the last day of each month.
      (2)   Monthly payments of taxes withheld shall be made by an employer if
the taxes withheld in the prior calendar year were less than $12,000 but more
than $2,399 or if the taxes withheld during any month for the preceding quarter
exceeded $200. Commencing with taxable years subsequent to December 31, 1998,
monthly payments of taxes withheld shall be made by an employer if the taxes
withheld in the prior calendar year were less than $12,000 but more than $3,599
or if taxes withheld during any month for the preceding quarter exceeded $300.
Such payments shall be paid to the Village within 15 days after the close of
each calendar month. However, those taxes accumulated for the third month of
the calendar quarter by employers making monthly payments pursuant to this
division need not be paid until the last day of the month following such
quarter.
      (3)   All employers not required to make semimonthly or monthly payments
of taxes withheld under (1) and (2) above shall make quarterly payments no
later than the last day of the month following the end of each quarter.
   (C)   Each employer who maintains a place of business in the Village and
another branch within the metropolitan area of the Village shall also withhold
the tax from the employees residing in the Village but working at the
employer's metropolitan area branch, even though the payroll records and place
of payment are outside the Village.
   (D)   The employer shall make and file a return on a form furnished by the
Fiscal Officer, showing the amount of tax deducted by the employer from the
salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation of any employee and paid by
the employer to the Fiscal Officer.
   (E)   Each employer on or before January 31, unless written request for 30
days' extension is made to and granted by the Clerk-Treasurer, following any
calendar year in which such deductions have been made, or should have been made
by such employer, shall file with the Clerk-Treasurer an information return
(Marble Cliff Withholding Statement of Wages Paid, and Marble Cliff Income Tax
Withheld), for each employee from whom income tax has been or should have been
withheld showing the name and address of the employee, the total amount of
salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation paid the employee during
the year, and the amount of Village income tax withheld from each employee.
   (F)   Where a resident of the Village performs service for his employer in
another municipality, which services are subject to withholding in the other
municipality, the employer shall have the authority to reduce the withholding
to the Village to the extent of the tax liability in the other municipality.
   (G)   The officer or the employee having control or supervision of or
charged with the responsibility of filing the report and making payment, is
personally liable for failure to file the report or pay the tax due as required
by this section. The dissolution of a corporation does not discharge an
officer's or employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation to
file returns or pay tax due.

§ 36.03 DEFINITIONS.
   Any term used in this chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter
has the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in laws of the United
States relating to federal income taxation or in Title 57 of the Ohio Revised
Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title 57 of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title 57 of the Ohio Revised
Code. For purposes of this section, the singular shall include the plural, and
the masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral. As used in
this chapter:
   (A)   ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME, for a person required to file as a C
corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
under division (W)(4) of this section, means a C corporation’s federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (A)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code;
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code;
         (b)   Division (A)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income;
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income;
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under R.C. § 4313.02;
      (8)   (a)   Except as limited by divisions (A)(8)(b), (c) and (d) of this
section, deduct any net operating loss incurred by the person in a taxable year
beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The amount of such net operating loss
shall be deducted from net profit that is reduced by exempt income to the
extent necessary to reduce municipal taxable income to zero, with any remaining
unused portion of the net operating loss carried forward to not more than five
consecutive taxable years following the taxable year in which the loss was
incurred, but in no case for more years than necessary for the deduction to be
fully utilized.
         (b)   No person shall use the deduction allowed by division (A)(8)(a)
of this section to offset qualifying wages.
         (c)   1.   For taxable years beginning in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, or
2022, a person may not deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by the
municipal corporation that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, more
than 50% of the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed by division (A)(8)(a)
of this section.
            2.   For taxable years beginning in 2023 or thereafter, a person
may deduct, for purposes of an income tax levied by a municipal corporation
that levies an income tax before January 1, 2016, the full amount allowed by
division (A)(8)(a) of this section.
         (d)   Nothing in division (A)(8)(c)1. of this section precludes a
person from carrying forward, for use with respect to any return filed for a
taxable year beginning after 2018, any amount of net operating loss that was
not fully utilized by operation of division (A)(8)(c)1. of this section. To the
extent that an amount of net operating loss that was not fully utilized in one
or more taxable years by operation of division (A)(8)(c)1. of this section is
carried forward for use with respect to a return filed for a taxable year
beginning in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022, the limitation described in division
(A)(8)(c)1. of this section shall apply to the amount carried forward.
         (e)   Any person utilizing a post-2017 net operating loss carryforward
deduction shall submit with the return reflecting said deduction a schedule
detailing the calculation and application of the net operating loss
carryforward.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer’s federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group’s federal taxable income in accordance with §
36.06(C)(5)(c)2. of this chapter.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer’s federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group’s federal taxable income in accordance with §
36.06(C)(5)(c)2. of this chapter.
      (11)   Add any deduction for pass-through entity not allowed as a
deduction for a C-Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code.
      (12)   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a publicly traded
partnership that has made the election described in division (W)(4) of this
section, and is not an individual, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal
taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation,
except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a
partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former
member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in
consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under

§ 36.05 COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (A)   Collection at source; withholding from qualifying wages.
      (1)   (a)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located
or doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an
amount equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in
the Municipality multiplied by the tax rate of 2% of the gross qualifying
wages, earned or deemed to be received from said employer except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under §
36.05(B) of this chapter or divisions (A)(4) or (A)(6) of this section. An
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the
tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer
directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
         (b)   In the case of employees who are non-resident professional
athletes, the deduction and withholding of personal service compensation shall
attach to the entire amount of wages, salaries and other compensation received
for games that occur in the taxing community. In the case of a non-resident
athlete not paid specifically for the game played in a taxing community, the
following apportionment formula must be used: The wages, salaries and other
compensation earned and subject to tax is the total income earned during the
taxable year, including incentive payments, signing bonuses, reporting bonuses,
incentive bonuses, roster bonuses and other extras, multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of exhibition, regular season, and post-
season games the athlete played (or was available to play for his team, as for
example, with substitutes), or was excused from playing because of injury or
illness, in the taxing community during the taxable year, and the denominator
of which is the total number of exhibition, regular season, and post season
games which the athlete was obligated to play under contract or otherwise
during the taxable year, including games in which the athlete was excused from
playing because of injury or illness. Exhibition games are only those games
played before a paying audience, and played against another professional team
from the same professional league. In the case of non-resident salaried
athletic team employees who are not professional athletes, deduction and
withholding shall attach to wages, salaries and other compensation earned for
personal services performed in the Municipality.
         (c)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division
(A)(1)(a) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
may also deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the
municipal corporation in which the employee is a resident.
      (2)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         (a)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (A)(2)(b) or (A)(2)(c) of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end
of each calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded
$2,399, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200. Payment under division (A)(2)(b) of
this section shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax
Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month.
         (c)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted on behalf of the Municipality in the preceding
calendar year exceeded $11,999, or if the total amount of taxes deducted and
withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the Municipality
in any month of the preceding calendar year exceeded$1,000. The payment under
division (A)(2)(c) of this section shall be made so that they payment is
received by the Tax Administrator not later than one of the following:
            1.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld during the first 15 days of a month, the third banking
day after the fifteenth day of that month;
            2.   If the taxes were deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first
day of the immediately following month, the third banking day after the last
day of that month.
         (d)   An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer’s, agent’s, or other payer’s obligation to file any return as
required under this section. Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return on or before the last day of the month following the close of
each calendar quarter showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted
in accordance with the payment schedule prescribed by division (A)(2) hereof to
the Tax Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer
under this division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return
required of an employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter
is the qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer unless the municipality requires all resident
individuals to file a tax return under §
36.09(A)(1)(b).
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual’s disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation’s
successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from
whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee’s qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section. At no time shall an employer withhold at a rate
greater than that of the Municipality.
      (11)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and
constituting qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities
are under the employer’s control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or
gratuity is under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the
customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the
customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s
qualifying wages subject to division (B)(2)(a)1. of this section among those
two or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair
and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee’s “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            3.   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(B)(2)(b) of this section, except that “location” shall be substituted for
“municipal corporation” wherever “municipal corporation” appears in that
division.
      (2)   (a)   Subject to divisions (B)(3), (B)(5), (B)(6) and (B)(7) of
this section, an employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on

performance of services in the employee’s capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
         (b)   For the purposes of division (B)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a
municipal corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any
other municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the
amount of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent
performing one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have
been spent at the employee’s principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;

            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)
(2)(b)3. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee’s employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee’s final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee’s
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(2)(a) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee’s
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee’s principal place of work is located.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section, the employer shall withhold
and remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
         (b)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (B)(4)(a) of this section may elect to withhold tax
for that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
         (c)   If an employer makes the election described in division (B)(4)
(b) of this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during
those first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee’s
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
      (5)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee’s qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer’s fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in §
36.03 of this chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer’s federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (B)(2)(a) and (B)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of division (A) of this section.
      (7)   In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification
code facility classification of 2911, petroleum refining. Notwithstanding
division (B)(4) of this section, if, during a calendar year, the number of days
an individual performs personal services at a petroleum refinery exceeds 12,
the employer shall withhold tax for the municipal corporation for the first 12
days for which the employer paid qualifying wages to the individual and for all
subsequent days in the calendar year on which the individual performed services
at the refinery.
   (C)   Collection at source; casino and video lottery terminal. 
       (1)   The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
R.C. § 3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video lottery
terminals sales on behalf of the state to withhold and remit municipal income
tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in this
section.
      (2)   If a person’s winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the Internal Revenue Service of the amount is required by section

2% imposed by the municipality in which the casino facility is located.
      (3)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in
trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
         (a)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator

Municipality, providing the name, address, and social security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
         (b)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator
of the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is located,

and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for
that reporting period that information shall be indicated on the annual return.
         (c)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person’s winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division. The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
         (d)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
         (e)   1.   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise
quits the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any
penalties and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor
shall withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
                a.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the
amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been
paid;
               b.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
            2.   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
         (f)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
      (4)   If a person’s prize award from a video lottery terminal is an
amount for which reporting to the Internal Revenue Service is required by
section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales
agent shall deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person’s prize
award at the tax rate of 2% imposed by the municipality in which the video

prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person’s name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
         (b)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery
sales agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of
the Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of
the persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the
amount of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar
month, the amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld,
and any other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return,
the video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax
Administrator all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
         (c)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (C)(5) of this section and shall make those
records available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with R.C. § 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
         (d)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each
video lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically
with the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility
is located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the
preceding calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit
electronically with the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld
and that was not previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security
number of a person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that
person was omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period that
information shall be indicated on the annual return.
         (e)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person’s prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
         (f)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (6)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due. If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the
successor is personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and
withheld and penalties and interest thereon.
      (7)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold
the required amount from a person’s prize award does not relieve that person
from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
      (8)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
         (a)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted
and withheld under this section, a penalty equal to 50% of the tax deducted and
withheld;

36.07 of this chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
      (10)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts
and returns required under this section.

§ 36.06 INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
   (A)   Determining municipal taxable income for taxpayers who are not
individuals. “Municipal Taxable Income” for a taxpayer who is not an individual
for the Municipality is calculated as follows: “Income” reduced by “Exempt
Income” to the extent otherwise included in income, multiplied by apportionment
equals “Municipal Taxable Income”.
      (1)   INCOME for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the “Net
Profit” of the taxpayer.
         (a)   NET PROFIT for a person other than an individual is defined in §
36.03(W) of this chapter.
         (b)   ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME is defined in §
36.03(A) of this chapter.
      (2)   EXEMPT INCOME is defined in §
36.03(K) of this chapter.
      (3)   APPORTIONMENT means the apportionment as determined by §
36.06(B) of this chapter.
   (B)   Net profit; income subject to net profit tax; alternative
apportionment. This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides
in the Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company,
or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under R.C.
Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         (a)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated. As used
in this paragraph, “tangible personal or real property” shall include property
rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall be
determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual’s services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under §
36.05(B) of this chapter;
         (c)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)   If the apportionment factors described in division (B)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by §
36.19(A) of this chapter.
         (c)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(2)(a) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by §
36.19(A) of this chapter.
         (d)   Nothing in division (B)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (B)(1)(b) of this section, “wages, salaries,
and other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation
paid to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         (a)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            1.   The employer;
            2.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in division (B)(3)(a)2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
         (b)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (B)(3)(a) or (B)(3)(b) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
         (a)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
            2.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation
from a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         (b)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
         (c)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
         (d)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
         (e)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal
corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the
municipal corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net
profit resides. A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to
use separate accounting   for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused
under this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is
located. For purposes of the application of any net operating loss realized
from the rental of real estate, said loss is to be applied using separate
accounting as it relates to those properties within a given municipal taxing
jurisdiction. Common or shared expenses relating to rental real estate shall be
allocated equally among all rental properties.
      (6)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(6)(b) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
         (b)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual’s net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual’s annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under §
36.08(A) of this chapter.
      (7)   If, in computing a taxpayer’s adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee’s
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (K)(12) and (FF)(1)(c) of §
36.03 of this chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. This
division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the amount
of a taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to a municipal corporation
under this section.
      (8)   When calculating the ratios described in division (B)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (B)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner’s ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (C)   Consolidated federal income tax return.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         (a)   AFFILIATED GROUP OF CORPORATIONS means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, such incumbent local exchange carrier shall be excluded from the
affiliated group.
         (b)   CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
         (c)   CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. CONSOLIDATED
FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (C)
(1)(a) of this section.
         (d)   INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 4927.01.
         (e)   LOCAL EXCHANGE TELEPHONE SERVICE has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 5727.01.
      (2)   (a)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
            1.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.
            2.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (C)(2)(b) of this section; or
            3.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The
Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         (b)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (C)(2)(a) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
         (c)   An election made under division (C)(2)(a) or (C)(2)(b) of this
section is binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations
subject to a municipal income tax.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
      (4)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (C)(5)(b), (C)(5)
(c), and (C)(5)(d) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated
municipal income tax return shall compute adjusted federal taxable income, as
defined in §
36.03(A) of this chapter, by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income”
for “federal taxable income” wherever “federal taxable income” appears in that
division and by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation’s” for “a C
corporation’s” wherever “a C corporation’s” appears in that division.
         (b)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under §
36.03(A) of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
         (c)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
36.06(B) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
36.06(B) of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to the municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group. The entity shall be subject to
taxation as a separate taxpayer on that portion of the entity’s net profit or
loss not included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated
group and sitused to the municipal corporation.
         (d)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in §
36.06(B) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make the computations required under §
36.06(B) of this chapter by substituting “consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in
that section and by substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for
“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with
this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
   (D)   Tax credit for businesses that foster new jobs in the municipality.
The Municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality. If a credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding fifteen years.
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.
   (E)   Tax credits to foster job retention. The Municipality, by ordinance,
may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit against its tax on income to a
taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job retention in the Municipality. If a
credit is granted under this section, it shall be measured as a percentage of
the income tax revenue the Municipality derives from the retained employees of
the taxpayer, and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years. Before the
Municipality passes an ordinance allowing such a credit, the Municipality and
the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of the
credit.

the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic
funds transfer, the date the payment is submitted. As used in this division,
DATE OF THE POSTMARK means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (c)   A taxpayer having a taxable year of less than 12 months shall
make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (d)   Taxes withheld by a casino operator or by a lottery sales agent

estimated taxes.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of municipal income tax returns under §

month of the first taxable year after the taxpayer becomes subject to tax for
the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes
and withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67.5% of the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, 90% of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator. When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates. The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with §
36.09(A) of this chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to R.C. § 5747.08(G).
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer’s
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest shall be imposed pursuant to §
36.10 of this chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that

         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under §
36.09(A) of this chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.

§ 36.08 CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   (A)   Credit for municipal income tax paid.
      (1)    Resident individual.
         (a)   An individual taxpayer who resides in the municipality, and
earns qualifying wages for work done or services performed or rendered in any
municipal corporation, shall be allowed a credit in the amount of municipal
income tax paid by or on behalf of that individual if it is demonstrated that a
municipal income tax has been so paid. Such credit shall be allowed only to the
extent of the tax assessed by this chapter.
         (b)    A resident individual with income from an ownership interest in
one or more pass-through entities, activities of a sole proprietor, or rental
activities, after the deduction of distributable losses from other pass-through
entities or business activities not utilized as a net operating loss carry-
forward in any municipal taxing jurisdiction after January 1, 2018, shall be
allowed a non-refundable credit for the amount so paid by him or in his behalf
in such other municipal corporation only to the extent of the tax assessed by
this chapter.
         (c)   The credit for tax paid by a resident individual for salaries or
wages earned in a non-resident municipal corporation is limited to the tax that
is paid after all allowable 2106 expenses have been deducted and shall not
exceed the tax established by this chapter.
         (d)   No credit shall be given to a resident individual for any school
district income tax.
      (2)   Non-resident individual.
         (a)   Every individual taxpayer who is a non-resident of the
municipality who earned qualifying wages for work done or services performed or
rendered in the municipality, shall be allowed a credit for the amount so paid
if it is demonstrated that a municipal income tax has been paid by or on behalf
of that individual. Such credit shall be applied only to the extent of the tax
assessed by this chapter.
         (b)   A non-resident individual with ownership interest in one or more
pass-through entities taxed at the entity level shall not report said income or
losses on a non-resident individual annual return and shall not be allowed any
credit for taxes paid on their behalf by the pass-through entity to any
municipal corporation.
         (c)   No credit shall be given to a non-resident individual for any
school district income tax.
   (B)   Refundable credit for qualifying loss.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         (a)   NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   1.   Except as provided in division (B)(1)(b)2. of this section,
QUALIFYING LOSS means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer’s receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
            2.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid
to one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount
of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the QUALIFYING LOSS is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (B)(1)(b)1. of this
section computed without regard to division (B)(1)(b)2. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            3.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   QUALIFYING TAX RATE means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to the municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
QUALIFYING TAX RATE is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
         (b)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section
from each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more
taxable years.
         (c)    If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal
corporation with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation
shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s proportionate
share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         (d)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   (a)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income
tax that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (b)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
         (a)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         (b)   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (C)   Credit for tax beyond statute for obtaining refund.
      (1)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in §
36.09(F) of this chapter.
      (2)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in §
36.09(F), the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality’s tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
      (3)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in §
36.09(F) of this chapter.
(Ord. O-2475-15, passed 12-14-15)

taxable income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by every
taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the tax,
regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
         (b)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
and individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer,

individual’s duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.

section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer’s Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, “Wage and Tax Statements,” including all information
reported on the taxpayer’s federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service
form; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any other
documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments made
in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.
         (c)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include,
with each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for
refund required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
         (d)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual
net profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some
other manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to
the Tax Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is
available, submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business

publish a method of electronically submitting the documents required under this
division through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The
State of Ohio department shall transmit all documents submitted electronically
under this division to the appropriate Tax Administrator.
         (e)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer’s
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (A)(6)
of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic
form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         (f)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
      (7)   (a)   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under R.C. §

Administrator.
            3.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is $10 or less.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers
not otherwise required to file annual returns.
         (c)   With respect to taxpayers to whom division (B) of this section
applies, if any provision in this division conflicts with any provision in
division (B) of this section, the provision in division (B) of this section
prevails.
      (8)   (a)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality
shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
amount due is $10 or less.
         (b)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (A)(8)(a) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (A)(6)(c) and (A)(6)(d)
of this section.
      (9)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
§
36.05(A)(2) of this chapter.
         (a)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
THE DATE OF POSTMARK means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         (b)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to
an account designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments,
except that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, SUBMITTED THE PAYMENT means the date which the taxpayer has designated
for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date as the date
the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
      (10)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in §
36.05(A) of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
      (11)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer’s refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing
a generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality’s Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
      (13)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a paid tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.

meaning as in §
36.05(B) of this chapter.
         (b)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the
person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal
corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this
chapter. The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a
taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation’s
income tax for the taxable year.
         (c)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation’s resolutions, ordinances, or rules.” The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (d)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (A)(14)
(a) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file
any tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of municipal
taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (A)(14) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from
performing an audit of the person.
   (B)   Return and payment of tax; individuals serving in combat zone.
      (1)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member’s or civilian’s
duty service and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be filed on or
before the one hundred eightieth day after the member’s or civilian’s duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant’s active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(2)(c) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract
terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
         (b)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-
first day after the applicant’s active duty or service terminates.
         (c)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division
(B)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes
for the extension period.
      (3)   (a)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section.
         (b)   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension
under the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in
which to file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of
time in which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (B)(3)(b)1. of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this section, QUALIFYING TAXPAYER means a member of the

contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
            2.   Tax, the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (B)(3)(b)1. of this section, is not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (B)(3)(b)1. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (B)(1), (B)(2), or (B)(3)
of this section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2)(b)
and (B)(2)(c) or (B)(3) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of
that taxpayer if the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married
filing jointly for that year.
   (C)   Use of Ohio Business Gateway; types of filings authorized.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer’s net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
      (4)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
      (5)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
   (D)   Extension of time to file.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for
a period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
      (3)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer’s municipal income tax return. If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is
originally due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested
extension.
      (4)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
      (5)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under R.C. § 5747.08(G), a taxpayer shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
same as the extended due date of the state income tax return.
   (E)   Amended returns.
      (1)   (a)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
         (b)   Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is $10 or less.
         (c)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return, following the provisions of §
36.06(C) of this chapter.
      (2)   (a)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is $10 or
less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as provided
under division (E)(2)(b) of this section, the amended return shall not reopen
those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed
return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment
to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return unless the applicable
statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under §
36.19 of this chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
         (b)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
      (3)   (a)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed in §
36.09(F) for filing the amended return even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is $10 or less, no refund need be
paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in division (E)
(3)(b) of this section, a request filed under this division shall claim refund
of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s
federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed within the time
prescribed in §
36.09(F) of this chapter. Except as set forth in division (E)(3)(b) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax return.
         (b)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (F)   Refunds.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund and after audit of such
request, the Tax Administrator of the Municipality, in accordance with this
section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers, other payers, or
taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax levied by the
Municipality:
         (a)   Overpayments of more than $10;
         (b)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds $10.
      (2)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer’s claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
         (b)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (F)
(2)(c) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
         (c)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and provide
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under §
36.18 of this chapter.
      (3)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for
filing specified in division (F)(2) of this section shall be considered to have
been filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
         (a)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
         (b)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only
postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is received within seven days of such last
day.
         (c)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
      (4)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
90 days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest
shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of
interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be
considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the
tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in §
36.10(A)(4) of this chapter.
      (5)   As used in this section, WITHHOLDING TAX has the same meaning as in
§
36.10 of this chapter.

examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Fiscal
Officer believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the purpose
of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was filed, to
ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the Fiscal
Officer or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every employer,
taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to furnish the

person that is subject to, or that a Fiscal Officer believes is subject to, the
provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Fiscal Officer’s inspection
during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six years
following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate,
unless the Fiscal Officer, in writing, consents to their destruction within
that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Fiscal Officer
may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records
as the Fiscal Officer determines necessary to show whether or not that person
is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by the
Municipality or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Fiscal Officer may examine under oath any person that the
Fiscal Officer reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Fiscal Officer may, for this purpose, compel any such person
to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records,
and federal and state income tax returns in such person’s possession or
control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant,
bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This
division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an
attorney.’

Administrator’s findings, and, if the Tax Administrator finds that there has
been an overpayment, approve and issue a refund payable to the taxpayer, the

pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator’s own
motion, review, redetermine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax
Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the
Municipality:
         (a)   Compromise a claim;
         (b)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim
by agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator’s rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
      (4)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
      (5)   (a)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
         (b)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
      (6)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide

      (1)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may

person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   (a)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to §
36.10 of this chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in §
36.99 of this chapter.
         (b)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide

information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to §
36.10 of this chapter.

§ 36.16 OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)   An OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR means an opinion issued under this
section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It does not
include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer’s request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts relevant to a determination of the taxability of the income, source of
income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or transaction, all
parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly identified by name,
location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator’s response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (C)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator’s opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer’s date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality’s
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality’s income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer’s material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of §
36.15 of this chapter.
   (E)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. O-2475-15, passed 12-14-15)
§ 36.17 ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
R.C. § 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in R.C. § 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. O-2475-15, passed 12-14-15)
§ 36.18 LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
         (a)   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment.
         (b)   One member shall be appointed by the Mayor. This member may be
an employee of the Municipality, but may not be the Director of Finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the Mayor.
      (4)   Members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by the
legislative authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth
in R.C. § 718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. Any
member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member’s predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member’s
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for services on the Board.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative. The Board may allow a hearing to be
continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case, the hearing must
be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (E)   The Board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator’s
assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the Board’s final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board’s
final determination as provided in R.C. § 5717.011.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under R.C. § 149.43. For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to R.C. § 121.22. For this reason, such hearings shall
not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be present
during the hearing.
(Ord. O-2475-15, passed 12-14-15)
§ 36.19 ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in §
36.18 of this chapter. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under this chapter
imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after the
commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to file
a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be reported,
prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission of the
offense.
   (C)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in §
36.09(F) of this chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under §
36.18 of this chapter, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant’s
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by §
36.09(F) of this chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of that section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. O-2475-15, passed 12-14-15)
§ 36.20 ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to R.C. § 718.30, the legislative authority of the
Municipality has the authority, by ordinance or resolution, to adopt rules to
administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted per
Code.
(Ord. O-2475-15, passed 12-14-15)
§ 36.21 CONTRACT PROVISIONS.
   No contract on behalf of the Municipality for works or improvements for or
to the Municipality shall be binding or valid unless such contract contains the
following provisions:
      Said…hereby further agrees to withhold and remit all Municipal income
taxes due or payable under the provisions of Chapter 36, Village of Marble
Cliff Code, for qualifying wages, earned or deemed to be received by its
employees and further agrees that any of its subcontractors shall be required
to agree to withhold and remit any such Municipal income taxes due under said
chapter for services performed under this contract.

CHAPTER.
   (A)   A taxpayer may elect to be subject to §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code in lieu of the provisions set forth in the remainder of this
chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon the
taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)   The State Tax Commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator of
the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in §
36.24(C) is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)   The Commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to §§ 718.80 to
718.95 of the Revised Code, §§

36.38 of this code, and any applicable provision of Chapter 5703 of the Revised

   (B)   (1)   A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the Tax Commissioner and the village, on a form prescribed by the

taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the Tax Commissioner and the village of its
termination of the election.
         (b)   A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)   Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code, and is instead subject to the provisions set forth in the
remainder of this chapter.
   (C)   The Tax Commissioner shall enforce and administer §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code. In addition to any other powers conferred upon the Tax

      (1)   Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)   Adopt such rules as the Tax Commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)   Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out the
duties imposed upon the Tax Commissioner by those sections.
   (D)   The Tax Commissioner shall not be considered a Tax Administrator, as

36.03 of this code.
(Ord. O-2561-18, passed 3-19-18)
§ 36.24 DEFINITIONS; §§ 36.23 THROUGH 36.38.
   If a term used in §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a
comparable context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the use is not consistent,
then the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal
income tax shall have control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the
Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code,
in which case the definition in that chapter shall control. Any reference in
this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes other laws of the United
States related to federal income taxes. If a term is defined in both this
section and §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code, the definition in this section shall control for all uses
of that term in §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code.
   As used in §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code only:
   (A)   MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under § 36.25 of this code, as applicable, reduced by any
pre-2017 net operating loss carryforward available to the person for the
municipal corporation.
   (B)   ADJUSTED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME for a person required to file as a C
corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation as
described in division (D)(5) of § 718.01 of the Revised Code and §
36.03 of this code, means a C corporation's federal taxable income before net
operating losses and special deductions as determined under the Internal
Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)   Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)   Add an amount equal to 5% of intangible income deducted under
division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in § 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal
taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other
disposition of an asset described in § 1221 or § 1231 of the Internal Revenue
Code.
      (4)   (a)   Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in § 1221 or § 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)   Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in § 1245 or § 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)   Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)   In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)   Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under § 4313.02 of the
Revised Code.
      (8)   Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)   Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of
section §
36.29 of this code.
      (10)   Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with division (E)(3)(b) of section
§
36.29 of this code.
      If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that
has made the election described in division (I) of §
36.03 of this code, and is not a publicly traded partnership that has made the
election described in division (W)(4) of §
36.03 of this code, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted federal taxable income
under this section as if the taxpayer were a C corporation, except guaranteed
payments and other similar amounts paid or accrued to a partner, former
partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be
allowed as a deductible expense unless such payments are in consideration for
the use of capital and treated as payment of interest under § 469 of the
Internal Revenue Code or United States Treasury regulations. Amounts paid or
accrued to a qualified self-employed retirement plan with respect to a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member of
the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued to or for health insurance for a partner,
former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member, and
amounts paid or accrued to or for life insurance for a partner, former partner,
shareholder, former shareholder, member, or former member shall not be allowed
as a deduction.
      Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing
the taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed
as allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes
of federal self-employment tax.
   (C)   TAXPAYER has the same meaning as in §
36.03(SS) of this code, except that TAXPAYER does not include natural persons
or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745 of the Revised Code.
TAXPAYER may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in bankruptcy when such
persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)   TAX RETURN or RETURN means the notifications and reports required to
be filed pursuant to §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code for the purpose of reporting municipal income taxes, and
includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)   TAXABLE YEAR means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code is changed accordingly but may consist of an aggregation of
more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The Tax
Commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable year
for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal income tax
purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years for federal
income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for a new
taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)   ASSESSMENT means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to §
36.33 of this code.
(Ord. O-2561-18, passed 3-19-18)
§ 36.25 APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the village and that has made the election under §
36.23 of this code.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the village shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)   (a)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
         (b)   As used in the preceding division (1)(a), tangible personal or
real property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the
value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental
thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under § 36.05(B) of this code;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the village to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the village, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Commissioner may require,
that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)   Separate accounting;
         (b)   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)   A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of §
36.33 of this code.
      (3)   The Tax Commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of §
36.33 of this code.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)   The employer;
         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the village
as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the village only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the village from
a stock of goods located within the village.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the village from a location
outside the village, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
   (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
village to the extent that such services are performed in the village.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the village shall be sitused to the village.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the village shall be sitused to the
village.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the village based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the village.
   (E)   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the village in
which the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent
or broker shall be allocated to the village based upon the ratio of the
commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of
real estate located in the village to the commissions received from the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)   (1)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income,
the taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (K)(12) and (A)(3) of §
36.03 of this code by the village or substantially similar provision of the
codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the taxpayer shall add
the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to the village. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to the village any amount other than the
amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were the amount
related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
      (2)   This division applies solely for the purpose of making an
adjustment to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the
village under this section.
   (G)   When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.

§ 718.84(E) of the Revised Code, provide tax returns and other information it
receives in the performance of its administration of the municipal net profits
tax for taxpayers making the election provided in §
36.23 of this code. The Tax Administrator shall review these returns and
information, as well as the information received pursuant to divisions (B) and
(C) of this section, and has discretion to refer any taxpayer for audit by the
Tax Commissioner. Such referral shall be made on a form prescribed by the
Commissioner and shall include any information that forms the basis for the
referral.
      (2)   If the Tax Commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by

         (b)   A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically

extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the Commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the Commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
Commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)   An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax

   (E)   Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section shall
include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the Tax Commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the Commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
Commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the

§ 36.29 CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   AFFILIATED GROUP OF CORPORATIONS means an affiliated group as
defined in § 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a group
includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily

state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN  means a consolidated return
filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to § 1501 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (3)   CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME means the consolidated taxable
income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the purposes of
filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before consideration of net
operating losses or special deductions. CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME
does not include income or loss of an incumbent local exchange carrier that is
excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)(1) of this section.
      (4)   INCUMBENT LOCAL EXCHANGE CARRIER has the same meaning as in §
4927.01 of the Revised Code.

at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Commissioner. The Tax
Commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under §
36.23 of this code, a valid election made by the taxpayer under division (W)(4)
(c) or (W)(4)(d) of §
36.03 of this code is binding upon the Tax Commissioner for the remainder of
the five-year period.
      (5)   When an election made under §
36.23 of this code is terminated, a valid election made under this section is
binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-year period.
   (C)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the Tax Commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States Department of Treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of

   (E)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in §
36.24 of this code, by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income" for
"federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that
division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C
corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of §
36.24 of this code to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following with
respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
36.25 of this code, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in §
36.25 of this code, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly or
indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall exclude
the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the
computations required in § 36.25 of this code, exclude the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the
affiliated group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code on the basis of the entity's net profits that would
otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group.
   (F)   Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under §
36.25 of this code by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)   Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code or Chapter 5703 of the Revised Code to the corporation, an
affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any portion of the
taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.

§ 36.30 FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under §
36.23 of this code fails to pay any tax as required under §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code, or any portion of that tax, on or before the date
prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and paid, in
the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per annum
prescribed by § 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date prescribed for its
payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is issued under §
36.33 of this code, whichever occurs first.
(Ord. O-2561-18, passed 3-19-18)
§ 36.31 DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:
      (1)   COMBINED TAX LIABILITY means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)   ESTIMATED TAXES means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least $200.
      (2)   Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than 12 months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the Commissioner.
      (3)   The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   The Tax Commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)   Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the Tax Commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the Treasurer of State.
      (1)   The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 22½% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 45% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, 67½% of the combined tax liability for the
taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, 90% of the combined tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)   Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)   Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the Commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the Treasurer of
State. The Treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of § 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
§ 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22½% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67½% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently due.
      (3)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in accordance with § 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)   An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the combined tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a municipal income tax return for
that year.

         (a)   For each of the first two failures, 5% of the amount required to
be reported on the return;
         (b)   For the third and any subsequent failure, 10% of the amount
required to be reported on the return.
      (3)   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under § 36.23 of
this code fails to timely pay an amount of tax required to be paid under this
chapter, the Commissioner may impose a penalty equal to 15% of the amount not
timely paid.
      (4)   If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code that does not contain information upon which the substantial
correctness of the return may be judged or contains information that on its
face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the filing of
the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a desire
that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration of §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code, a penalty of up to $500 may be imposed.
      (5)   If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
$1,000 or 100% of the tax required to be shown on the return.
      (6)   If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
§
36.34 of this code, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the greater of
$1,000 or 100% of the claim. Any penalty imposed under this division, any
refund issued on the claim, and interest on any refund from the date of the
refund, may be assessed under §
36.33 of this code without regard to any time limitation for the assessment
imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)   For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)   Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the Tax Commissioner. The Commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)   All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code and shall be credited and distributed to municipal
corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability is required
to be distributed to such municipal corporations under § 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
(Ord. O-2561-18, passed 3-19-18)
§ 36.33 ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)   (1)   If any taxpayer required to file a return under §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code fails to file the return within the time prescribed, files
an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the tax due for the
period covered by the return, the Tax Commissioner may make an assessment
against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the return or
tax is due, based upon any information in the Commissioner's possession.
      (2)   The Tax Commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against
a taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the Commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in §
36.34 of this code for the same period of time. There shall be no bar or limit
to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return subject to
assessment as required by §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code, or that files a fraudulent return. The Commissioner shall
give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment as provided in §
5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the Commissioner shall provide
instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing on the
petition.
   (B)   Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the Tax Commissioner within 60
days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the Treasurer of State. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the Commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the Commissioner shall proceed under §
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)   (1)   After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the
assessment remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the
Tax Commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office
of the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas in the county in which the taxpayer
has an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin County.
      (2)   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the Clerk shall enter a
judgment against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The
judgment may be filed by the Clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special
judgments for municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other
judgments. Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the Tax
Commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
      (3)   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within 60 days after
the day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of
tax due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by § 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the Commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the Attorney General for
collection under § 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If the
unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the Attorney General for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by § 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date of
certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall be paid
in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an assessment
under this section.
   (D)   All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)   If the Tax Commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the Commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the Commissioner shall file an entry with the Clerk of the
Court of Common Pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in § 5703.37 of the
Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the Clerk. The
total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the Commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the Commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is
pending, the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the
subject of the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the Treasurer of State
does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the
petition.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Commissioner, upon petition so filed or
pursuant to a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals or any court to which the
determination or decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the
taxpayer under the corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there
shall be issued to the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund
in the amount of the overpayment as provided by §
36.34 of this code, with interest on that amount as provided by that section.
(Ord. O-2561-18, passed 3-19-18)
§ 36.34 REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)   An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on any
illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code, including assessments, shall be filed with the Tax
Commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal, erroneous, or
excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period allowed by
division (A) of §
36.33 of this code. The application shall be filed in the form prescribed by
the Tax Commissioner.
   (B)   (1)   On the filing of a refund application, the Tax Commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than $10 and not less than that claimed,
the Commissioner shall certify that amount to the Director of Budget and
Management and the Treasurer of State for payment from the tax refund fund
created in § 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than $10
but less than that claimed, the Commissioner shall proceed in accordance with §
5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)   Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the Commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under § 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (C)   Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within 90 days after such determination shall bear interest
at the rate per annum prescribed by § 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
ninety-first day after such determination until the day the refund is paid or
credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest shall be paid at that
rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous assessment until the
day the refund is paid or credited.
(Ord. O-2561-18, passed 3-19-18)
§ 36.35 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in
an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under §
36.23 of this code and used to determine the tax due under §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code must be altered as the result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by the taxpayer or the
Internal Revenue Service, and such alteration affects the taxpayer's tax
liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with
the Tax Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner requires. The amended
return shall be filed not later than 60 days after the adjustment is agreed
upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or after any federal
income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting
therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first. If a taxpayer
intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax return, or to
amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated return, based
on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the taxpayer shall
notify the Commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under §
36.33 of this code for the purpose of assessing any additional tax due under
this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest. The amended
return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from
a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that are not
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal tax return.
   (C)   In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the 60-day period prescribed for filing the amended
return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in §
36.34 of this code, if the application otherwise conforms to the requirements
of that section. An application filed under this division shall claim refund of
overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return that are
affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's
federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the time prescribed in
§
36.34 of this code. The application shall not reopen those facts, figures,
computations, or attachments that are not affected, either directly or
indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return.
(Ord. O-2561-18, passed 3-19-18)
§ 36.36 EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)   The Tax Commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof, may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any taxpayer or other person that is subject to §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made
or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as required under those
sections. Upon written request by the Commissioner or a duly authorized agent
or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Commissioner, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to §§
36.23 to
36.38 of this code shall be open to the Tax Commissioner's inspection during
business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six years following the
end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate, unless the
Commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction within that period, or
by order requires that they be kept longer. The Commissioner may require any
person, by notice served on that person, to keep such records as the
Commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not that person is liable,
and the extent of such liability, for the income tax levied by a municipal
corporation.
   (C)   The Tax Commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
Commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to comply.

36.06(D) or

36.23 of this code, against the municipal corporation's tax on income. A
municipal corporation shall submit the following information to the Tax
Commissioner on or before the later of January 31, 2018, or the thirty-first

credit for which the taxpayer is eligible, and the tax year to which the credit
is to be applied.
      (2)   Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the
Tax Commissioner.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Tax
Commissioner to enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to grant a credit, to
determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the village and taxpayer under §
36.06(D) or
36.06(E) of this code, or to modify the terms or conditions of any such
existing agreement.

§ 52.01 PURPOSE; INTENT.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for the continued operation and
maintenance of stormwater drainage systems in order to ensure the health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the Village. This chapter seeks
to meet that purpose through the following objectives:
      (1)   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation and streambank erosion and maintain the
integrity of stream channels.
      (2)   Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by
stormwater runoff from development that would otherwise degrade local water
quality.
      (3)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff that flows
from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-
development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable.
      (4)   Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained
and pose no threat to public safety.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   This chapter shall be applicable to any construction activity
disturbing 15,000 or more square feet of land. The chapter also applies to land
development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria
if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though
multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at
different times on different schedules.
      (2)   When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a
redevelopment project as defined in
§ 52.02, decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be
as directed by the Village. Stormwater sizing criteria will be dependent on the
amount of impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water
quality.
(Ord. O-1974-04, passed 2-23-04)
§ 52.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.

preventing or reducing point source or nonpoint source pollution inputs to
stormwater runoff and water bodies.
   WATERCOURSE. A permanent or intermittent stream or other body of water,
either natural or man-made, which gathers or carries surface water.
(Ord. O-1974-04, passed 2-23-04)
§ 52.03 DESIGN.
   (A)   Minimum control requirements.
      (1)   All stormwater best management practices (BMPs) shall be designed
in a manner to minimize the need for maintenance, and reduce the chances of
failure. In addition, all stormwater management facilities shall be designed so
that the specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g., recharge, water
quality, channel protection, 10 year, 100 year), as requested by the Village,
are met. The only exception would be if the Village grants the applicant a
waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements.
      (2)   If hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control
than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the Village reserves
the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to
control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
   (B)   Site design feasibility.
      (1)   Stormwater management practices for a site shall be chosen based on
the physical conditions of the site. Among the factors that should be
considered:
         (a)   Topography;
         (b)   Maximum drainage area;
         (c)   Depth to water table;
         (d)   Soils;
         (e)   Slopes ;
         (f)   Terrain;
         (g)   Head; or
         (h)   Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features or
ultra-urban areas.
      (2)   Applicants shall consult the most recent version of the Rainwater
and Land Development Manual from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources for
guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a
stormwater management practice.
   (C)   Conveyance issues.
      (1)   All stormwater management practices shall be designed to convey
stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow
velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to:
         (a)   Maximizing of flowpaths from inflow points to outflow points;
         (b)   Protection of inlet and outfall structures;
         (c)   Elimination of erosive flow velocities; or
         (d)   Providing of underdrain systems, where applicable.
      (2)   The Erosion and Sediment Control Plan, required by the Village’s
Erosion and Sediment Control/Grading Ordinance, shall provide detailed
information on the requirements for conveyance for each of the approved
stormwater management practices.
   (D)   Pretreatment requirements. Every stormwater treatment facility shall
have an acceptable form of water quality pretreatment, in accordance with the
practices listed in the most recent version of the Rainwater and Land
Development Manual from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Certain
stormwater treatment practices are prohibited even with pretreatment in the
following circumstances:
      (1)   Stormwater is generated from highly contaminated source areas known
as "hotspots";
      (2)   Stormwater is carried in a conveyance system that also carries
contaminated, non-stormwater discharges;
      (3)   Stormwater is being managed in a designated groundwater recharge
area; and
      (4)   Certain geologic conditions exist (e.g., karst) that prohibit the
proper pretreatment of stormwater.
   (E)   Non-structural stormwater practices. The use of non-structural
stormwater treatment practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance
on structural practices. Credit in the form of reductions in the amount of
stormwater that must be managed can be earned through the use of non-structural
practices that reduce the generation of stormwater from the site. Applicants
wishing to obtain credit for use of non-structural practices must ensure that
these practices are documented and remain unaltered by subsequent property
owners.
(Ord. O-1974-04, passed 2-23-04)
§ 52.04 MAINTENANCE EASEMENTS AND COVENANTS.
   (A)   Prior to the issuance of any permit that requires a stormwater
management facility, the applicant or owner of the site must execute a
maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners
of land served by the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall
provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection
by the Village, or their contractor or agent, and for regular or special
assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in
proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions
established by this chapter.
   (B)   Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be ensured
through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by
the Village and recorded into the land record prior to final plan approval. As
part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often
maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management
facility. The covenant shall also include plans for periodic inspections to
ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled cleanouts.
   (C)   Easements and covenants shall be recorded with the Franklin County
Recorder.
   (D)   If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of
the maintenance covenant, the Village, after reasonable notice, may correct a
violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all
necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event
that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety or
public health, the Village shall notify the party responsible for maintenance
of the stormwater management facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice,
the responsible person shall have 30 days to effect maintenance and repair of
the facility in an approved manner. After proper notice, the Village may assess
the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and
the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or prorated against the
beneficial users of the property, and may be placed on the tax bill and
collected as ordinary taxes.
(Ord. O-1974-04, passed 2-23-04)
§ 52.05 ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   All stormwater BMPs shall be maintained according to the measures
outlined in the most recent version of the Rainwater and Land Development
Manual from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, and as approved in the
permit.
   (B)   The person(s) or organization(s) responsible for continued maintenance
of the stormwater facilities shall be designated in the original Erosion and
Sediment Control Plan for the site. Options include:
      (1)   Property owner.
      (2)   Homeowner's association, provided that provisions for financing
necessary maintenance are included in deed restrictions or other contractual
agreements.
   (C)   Maintenance agreements shall specify responsibilities for financing
maintenance.
(Ord. O-1974-04, passed 2-23-04)
§ 52.06 NON-ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.
   (A)   Non-routine maintenance includes maintenance activities that are
expensive but infrequent, such as pond dredging or major repairs to stormwater
structures.
   (B)   Non-routine maintenance shall be performed on an as-needed basis based
on information gathered during regular inspections.
   (C)   If non-routine maintenance activities are not completed in a timely
manner, or as specified in the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan, the Village
may complete the necessary maintenance at the owner's/ operator's expense.
(Ord. O-1974-04, passed 2-23-04)
§ 52.07 INSPECTIONS.
   (A)   All stormwater management facilities must undergo, at minimum, an
annual inspection by the owner to document maintenance and repair needs and
ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter and accomplishment of
its purposes. These may include:
      (1)   Removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins,
inlets and drainage pipes;

activity.
   (B)   Access to facilities.
      (1)   Representatives of the Village shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the Village.
      (2)   Facility operators shall allow representatives of the Village ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an
NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional
duties as defined by state and federal law.
      (3)   Representatives of the Village shall have the right to set up on
any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
Village to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's storm water
discharge.
      (4)   The Village has the right to require the discharger to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Village and shall not be

access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit
and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES
permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an
offense if the person denies representatives of the Village reasonable access
to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized
or required by this chapter.
      (7)   If the Village has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he or she is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the Village may seek issuance of a search
warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-
hazardous materials, said person shall notify the Village in person or by phone
or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by
phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the Village
within three business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited
materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or
operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of
the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records
shall be retained for at least three years.

   (A)   Administration. The Mayor shall be the principal Village official
responsible for the administration of
Chapter 95, except as otherwise provided herein. The Mayor may delegate any or
all of the duties hereunder to the Village Engineer or other designee.
   (B)   Rights of way occupancy. Each person who occupies, uses or seeks to
occupy or use the rights of way to operate a system located in the rights of
way, or who has, or seeks to have, a system located in any rights of way, shall
apply for and obtain a certificate of registration pursuant to
Chapter 95. Any person owning, operating or maintaining a system in the rights
of way without a certificate of registration, including persons operating under
a permit, license or franchise issued by the Village prior to the effective
date of
Chapter 95 shall apply for and obtain a certificate of registration from the
Village, unless exempted by §
95.02(D). Application will consist of providing the information set forth in §
95.03 and as reasonably required by the Mayor.
   (C)   No construction without a certificate of registration. Following the
effective date of
Chapter 95, no person shall construct or perform any work on or in, or use any
system or any part thereof located on or in any rights of way without first
obtaining a certificate of registration. Whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree as provided for in §
95.99.
   (D)   Exceptions.
      (1)   The following entities are not obligated to obtain a certificate of
registration: the Village and resellers of services or persons that do not own
any system or facilities in the rights of way.
      (2)   The following entities are required to participate in the
certificate of registration process, but shall be exempt from the financial
obligations of the application fee required by §
95.03(a) and the registration maintenance fee required by §
95.05(A): the County, the City of Columbus and cable operators for the purpose
of providing only cable service and operating pursuant to a valid cable
franchise and video service provider for the purpose of providing only video
service and operating pursuant to a valid video service authorization issued in
accordance with R.C. § 1332.24, the City of Columbus, and the County. In
addition, cable operators shall be exempt from any requirement of the
certificate of registration process that is in direct conflict with the
requirements of, and/or specifically exempted by, a valid current and valid
cable franchise with the Village.
   (E)   Systems in place without a certificate of registration. Any system or
part of a system found in a right of way for which a certificate of
registration has not been obtained shall be deemed to be a nuisance and an
unauthorized use of the rights of way. The Village may exercise any remedies or
rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the
nuisance; taking possession of the facilities and/or non-complying portion of
such system; and/or prosecuting the violator.
   (F)   Future uses. In allowing providers and permittees to place facilities
in the rights of way, the village shall not be liable for any damages caused
thereby to any provider's facilities that are already in place or that shall be
placed in the rights of way unless those damages arise out of the sole
negligence, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud of the Village. No
provider is entitled to rely on the provisions of this chapter as creating a
special duty to any provider.
   (G)   Discontinuance of operations, abandoned and unused facilities.
      (1)   A provider who has discontinued or is discontinuing its operations
of any system in the Village shall:
         (a)   Provide information satisfactory to the Village that the
provider's obligations for its system in the rights of way under this section
and any other sections in the Code of Ordinances have been lawfully assumed by
another applicant and/or provider; or
         (b)   Submit a written proposal to re-use its facilities in a manner
that promotes the Village's goals of providing innovative and economic
solutions to efficiently and economically utilize limited rights of way
capacity. Such proposal must be approved by the Village Engineer; or
         (c)   Submit a written proposal for abandonment of facilities in place
indicating why good engineering practice would support this type of solution.
The Village Engineer must approve said proposal; or
         (d)   Completely remove all specifically identified portion(s) of its
system in a manner acceptable to the Village within a reasonable amount of time
if the Village believes that there exists a reasonable justification for such
removal; or
         (e)   Submit to the Village within a reasonable amount of time and in
accordance with R.C. §§ 4905.20 and 4905.21, a proposal for transferring
ownership of its facilities to the Village. If a provider proceeds under this
clause, the Village may, at its option where lawful:
            1.   Purchase the facilities; or
            2.   Unless a valid removal bond has already been posted pursuant
to §
95.17(B), require the provider to post a bond in an amount sufficient to
reimburse the Village for reasonably anticipated costs to be incurred in
removing the facilities.
      (2)   Facilities of a provider who fail to comply with this section and
which remain unused facilities shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned
facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The Village may exercise any remedies
or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Abating the nuisance;
         (b)   Taking possession of the facilities and restoring them to a
useable condition subject to a finding of the PUCO pursuant to the requirements
of R.C. §§ 4905.20 and 4905.21; or
         (c)   Requiring removal of the facilities by the provider or by the
provider's surety.
      (3)   If the Village requires a provider to remove unused facilities in
any rights of way, the Village shall use reasonable efforts to direct that this
removal occur in conjunction with other scheduled excavations of the rights of
way. If the Village abates the nuisance it may take all action necessary to
recover its costs and to abate said nuisance, including but not limited to,
those methods set forth in R.C. § 715.261.
   (H)   Nature of issuance. A certificate of registration shall not convey
equitable or legal title in the rights of way. A certificate of registration is
only the nonexclusive, limited right to occupy rights of way in the Village,
for the limited purposes and for the limited period stated in the certificate
of registration and in accordance with
Chapter 95 of the Code. The rights to occupy the right of way may not be
subdivided or subleased; provided, however, that two or more providers may
collocate facilities in the same area of the rights of way so long as each such
provider complies with the provisions of
Chapter 95. Collocating providers may file a joint application for a
construction permit. A certificate of registration does not excuse a provider
from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before
collocating its facilities on facilities of others, including the Village’s
facilities. A certificate of registration does not prevent a provider from
leasing space in or on the provider's system, so long as the sharing of
facilities does not cause a violation of law, including the provisions of
Chapter 95. A certificate of registration does not excuse a provider from
complying with any provisions of the code or other applicable law.
   (I)   Other approvals, permits, and agreements. In addition to a certificate
of registration, providers shall obtain any and all regulatory approvals,
permits, authorizations, or licenses necessary for the offering or provision of
such services from the appropriate federal, state and local authorities and
upon the Village's reasonable request, shall provide copies of such documents
to the Village. Further, a certificate of registration issued pursuant to
Chapter 95 shall not entitle a provider to use, alter, convert to, or interfere
with, the facilities, easements, poles, conduits, lines, pipelines, wires,
fiber, cable or any other real or personal property of any kind whatsoever
under the management or control of the Village.

the existing utility pole, and the restoration of the rights of way within 30
days weather permitting after the replacement utility pole is installed. Upon
request, the Village Engineer may grant the provider additional time for good
cause.
   (F)   Establishment of utility corridors.
      (1)   The Village Council may assign specific corridors within the rights
of way, or any particular segment thereof as may be necessary, for each type of
facilities that are, or that the Village Engineer expects may someday be,
located within the rights of way.
      (2)   Any provider whose facilities are in the rights of way and are in a
position at variance with utility corridors established by the Village Council
shall at the time of the next construction of the area, excluding normal
maintenance activities, move such facilities to their assigned position within
the rights of way. Existing underground facilities located within a designated
utility corridor shall not be required to relocate into adjacent or alternative
portions of the rights of way unless they are in conflict with an actual or
proposed public improvement project. The above requirements may be waived by
the Mayor for good cause shown including, but not limited to, consideration of
such factors as: the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety,
customer service needs, law precluding such undergrounding of facilities, and
hardship to the provider. If a provider is denied a requested waiver from the
above requirements, the provider may appeal the denial of the Mayor.
      (3)   The Village Engineer shall make every good faith attempt to
accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights of way as set forth
in this chapter.
      (4)   Providers may enter into written agreements to use existing poles
and conduits with the owners of same and shall use best efforts to install
their facilities within the rights of way.
      (5)   No facility placed in any rights of way shall be placed in such a
manner that interferes with normal travel on such rights of way.
      (6)   Unless otherwise stated in a certificate of registration, permit,
or §
95.03(F)(6)(c) all facilities within the rights of way shall be constructed and
located in accordance with the code and with the following provision:
         (a)   Whenever all existing facilities that have been traditionally
located overhead are located underground in a certain area within the Village,
a provider who desires to place its facilities in the same area must also
locate its facilities underground.
          (b)   Whenever a provider is required to locate or re-locate
facilities underground within a certain area of the Village, every provider
with facilities within the same area of the Village shall concurrently re-
locate their facilities underground.
         (c)   The above requirements may be waived by the Village for good
cause shown including, but not limited to, consideration of such factors as:
the remaining economic life of the facilities, public safety, customer service
needs, law precluding such undergrounding of the facilities, and hardship to
the provider. If a provider is denied a requested waiver from the above
requirements, the provider may appeal the denial of the Village Engineer to the
Mayor.
(Ord. O-2204-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 95.04 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Construction and major maintenance plan. Each provider shall, at the
time of initial application and by January 1 of each following year, file a
construction and major maintenance plan with the Village Fiscal Officer. Such
construction and major maintenance plan shall be provided for all geographical
areas requested by the Village Engineer, up to and including the entire
geographical area of the Village. It shall be submitted using a format(s)
mutually agreeable to the provider and the Village and shall contain the
information determined by the Village Engineer to be necessary to facilitate
the coordination and reduction in the frequency of construction in the rights
of way. The construction and major maintenance plan shall include, but not be
limited to, all currently scheduled and/or anticipated construction projects
for the next calendar year, if none are scheduled or anticipated then the plan
shall so state. The provider shall use its best efforts in supplying this
information and shall update the construction and major maintenance plan on
file with the Village Fiscal Officer whenever there is a material change in
scheduled and/or anticipated construction projects. In an effort to assist
providers with the completion of their annual construction and major
maintenance plan, the Village Engineer, as soon as possible, will send each
provider's system representative a descriptive narrative (and any mapping
information reasonably available) for all the planned right of way improvements
and/or scheduled maintenance that the Village then currently intends to
undertake during the calendar year.
   (B)   Mapping data. With the filing of its application for a certificate of
registration, a provider shall be required to accurately inform the Village of
the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right of way the
provider's system then currently occupies and begin submitting to the Village
all information that currently exists and which can be provided regarding the
location of its facilities in the right of way in hard copy or in the most
advanced format (including, but not limited to, electronic and/or digital
format) then currently being used by the provider that is then currently
capable of technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form)
by the Village. Unless otherwise required by §
95.13(B), a provider shall have up to one year from the date of the provider's
initial filing of an application for a certificate of registration to
completely submit all the mapping data for a provider's system in the entire
geographical area of the Village which it owns or over which it has control
that are located in any rights of way of the Village in the most advanced
format (including, but not be limited to electronic and/or digital format) then
currently being used by the provider that is then currently capable of
technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form) by the
Village. The mapping data is only required to be at the “atlas” level of detail
necessary for the Village to reasonably determine the location of the
provider's facilities in the rights of way. The provider shall supply the
mapping data on paper if the Village Engineer determines that the format
currently being used by the provider is not capable of being read by the
Village. Anytime after the issuance of a certificate of registration, and upon
the reasonable request of the Village Engineer, a provider shall be required to
provide to the Village any additional location information for any facilities
which it owns or over which it has control that are located in any rights of
way of the Village required by the Village. Any and all actual direct,
incidental and indirect costs incurred by the Village during the process of
reviewing, inputting and/or converting a provider's mapping information to
comport with the Village's then current standard format (whether electronic or
otherwise) shall be directly billed to, and must be timely remitted by, the
provider. Failure to pay such mapping costs within 60 days of receipt of an
invoice shall subject an applicant or provider to revocation of its certificate
of registration and the penalties of §
95.99. Further, each provider that has been issued a certificate of
registration shall accurately inform the Village on or before each subsequent
January 1 of the number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right of
way the provider's system then occupied as of the immediately previous December
1. The Village Engineer may, in the future, adopt additional specifications and
further define or modify the mapping data requirements under this section for
reasons including, but not limited to, changes in technology or the law
regarding public disclosure of a provider's mapping information. When the
Village modifies and/or amends the mapping data requirements, the Village shall
use best efforts to avoid unreasonably increasing the burden to the providers
that may be associated with satisfying the amended mapping requirements. When
the mapping requirements of §
95.04(B) are amended, each provider shall be served with a copy of the new
specifications or modifications by regular U.S. mail to the system
representative identified in each certificate of registration and in accordance
with §
95.19(B); provided, however, that any failure of any provider to actually
receive such notice shall not in any way affect the validity or enforceability
of said specifications or modifications.
   (C)   Exemption from disclosure. A provider shall notify the Village if the
provider believes that any specific document or portion of a document being
submitted to the Village is exempt from the public records disclosure
requirements of R.C. § 149.43. The notification shall be in writing and
indicate the specific document or portion of a document that the provider
believes is exempt from disclosure. The notification shall include the legal
basis for the claimed exemption, including the applicable statutory reference
and any additional information necessary to make a determination of exemption
for each specific document or portion of a document. If a public records
request is made for documents submitted by a provider, the Village will
consider the written notification in making its own independent determination
of whether a specific document or a portion of a document is exempt from the
disclosure requirements of R.C. § 149.43. To the extent permitted by law, the
village will endeavor to use reasonable best efforts to notify the provider of
the request prior to making the document available for inspection or copying.
(Ord. O-2204-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 95.05 COMPENSATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Compensation. As compensation for the Village's costs to administer
Chapter 95, manage, administer and control the rights of way and maintain each
certificate of registration issued, every provider or any person operating a
system shall pay to the Village registration maintenance fees beginning January
1, 2009. The registration maintenance fee shall be determined and assessed to
providers and other persons operating a system or otherwise using and occupying
the rights of way in accordance with the following process and formula:
      (1)   The Village by January 31 of each year shall calculate all actual
and incurred costs associated with rights of way management, administration and
control for the previous calendar year that the Village was not able to
reasonably recover through construction permit fees or other recovery
mechanisms provided for in
Chapter 95.
      (2)   Providers and applicants, as required in §
95.04(B), shall accurately inform the Village upon application for a
certificate of registration and on or before each subsequent January 1 of the
number of miles (rounded up to the nearest mile) of right of way the provider's
system then occupied as of the immediately previous December 1.
      (3)   The Village shall total the entire number of miles of right of way
reported as being used or occupied by all providers.
      (4)   The village shall divide the calculated costs referenced in §
95.05(A)(1) by the total number of miles of right of way reported as being used
or occupied by all providers as referenced in §
95.05(A)(3) to arrive at a per-mile cost number.
      (5)   The Village shall then multiply each provider's mileage calculation
as referenced in §
95.05(A)(2) by the per-mile cost calculation referenced in §
95.05(A)(4). The product shall be a provider's then current annual registration
maintenance fee.
      (6)   The Village shall perform its annual calculation of registration
maintenance fees following receipt of the providers required January 1 mileage
report. Registration maintenance fees shall be invoiced to providers on or
about February 1 of each calendar year and shall be due 30 days following
receipt.
      (7)   Cable companies operating under non-exclusive cable franchises for
the purposes of providing cable service, video services provider operating
under a VSA for the purpose of providing video services, and providers of open
video system services, which compensate the Village under other mechanisms in
an amount equal to or greater than the annual registration maintenance fee that
would normally be required for their right of way use in the Village, shall
have the mileage of the right of way they use and/or occupy included in the
calculations described in §
95.05, but shall not be required to contribute to the recovery of rights of way
costs as defined by
Chapter 95 with the exception of permit costs.
      (8)   The Village may by separate legislation enacted by Council on or
about January 31 of each year, in accordance with the results of §
95.05(A)(4), enact an initial and thereafter a new annual registration
maintenance fee (per mile) by appropriately increasing or decreasing the
previous years registration maintenance fee (per mile). Revised registration
maintenance fees shall be effective upon passage.
   (B)   Timing. Registration maintenance fees shall be paid in advance by
January 1 of each calendar year. Registration maintenance fees shall be paid in
full for the first year of the registration as a condition of the certificate
of registration becoming effective. Fees may be prorated from the effective
date of the certificate of registration to the end of the calendar year if less
than one full year.
   (C)   Taxes and assessments. To the extent taxes or other assessments are
imposed by taxing authorities on the use of village property as a result of a
provider's use or occupation of the rights of way, the provider shall be
responsible for payment of such taxes. Such payments shall be in addition to
any other fees payable pursuant to
Chapter 95 and shall not be considered an offset to, or in lieu of, the fees
and charges listed in
Chapter 95. The registration maintenance fee is not in lieu of any tax, fee, or
other assessment except as specifically provided in
Chapter 95, or as required by applicable law.
   (D)   Interest on late payments. In the event that any registration
maintenance fee is not paid to the Village by January 31, the provider shall
pay a monthly late charge of 1% of the unpaid balance for each month or any
portion thereof for which payment is not made.
   (E)   No accord and satisfaction. No acceptance by the Village of any
registration maintenance fee shall be construed as an accord that the amount
paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of such
registration maintenance fee payment be construed as a release of any claim the
Village may have for additional sums payable.
(Ord. O-2204-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 95.06 OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION.
   (A)   Reports. Upon reasonable request of the Mayor, a provider shall
provide the Village with a list of any and all material communications, public
reports, petitions, or other filings, either received from or submitted to any
municipal, county, state or federal agency or official (and any response
thereto submitted by or received by a provider), and any other information or
report reasonably related to a provider's obligations under
Chapter 95 which in any way materially effects the operation of the system or a
provider's representations and warranties set forth herein, but not including
tax returns or other filings which are confidential. Upon request, a provider
shall promptly, but in no case later than 30 business days following the
request, deliver to the Village a complete copy of any item on said list. Upon
the request of the Village, a provider shall promptly submit to the Village any
information or report reasonably related to a provider's obligations under
Chapter 95, its business and operations with respect to the system or its
operation, in such form and containing such information as the Village shall
specify. Such information or report shall be accurate and complete and supplied
within 30 days.
   (B)   Confidentiality. All information submitted to the Village that is
considered confidential/proprietary information must be clearly marked as such
when submitted. A provider, at any time after submitting information without
confidential/proprietary information markings, may request and shall be
provided the opportunity to, subsequently mark any provided information as
confidential/proprietary information. The Village shall exercise all reasonable
legal protections so as not to publicly disclose to any third party such
information unless required by law. The Village shall, following receipt of a
request for public disclosure of clearly marked trade secret and/or proprietary
information submitted by a provider, endeavor to use reasonable best efforts to
timely place the provider's system representative on notice that such a request
for public disclosure has been made.
   (C)   Provider's expense. All reports and records required under
Chapter 95 shall be furnished at the sole expense of a provider.
   (D)   Right of inspection and audit. The Village's designated
representatives shall have the right to inspect, examine, or audit during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to a provider under the
circumstances; documents, records, or other information which pertain to a
provider's operation of a system within the Village that are related to its
obligations under
Chapter 95. All such documents shall be made available within the Village or in
such other place that the Village may agree upon in writing in order to
facilitate said inspection, examination, or audit.
   (E)   Rules and regulations. The Village Engineer may propose, and Village
Council may adopt (and from time to time amend) the rules and regulations
regarding
Chapter 95, construction standards and occupancy requirements of the right of
way. Such rules and regulations shall not materially increase the obligation of
any provider hereunder, provided however that none of the following shall in
any way be considered a material increase in obligation; the adoption of rules
and regulations increasing fees; the requiring of the placement of facilities
in designated portions of the rights of way (underground or otherwise); the
overbuilding of facilities; or the requiring of joint-builds. Prior to the
adoption or amendment of the rules and regulations, the Village shall provide
written notice and a copy of the proposed language of such adoption or
amendment, via United States regular mail, to each provider who holds a then
current certificate of registration. Each provider shall then have 30 days
following the date of the Village's mailing to provide written comment
regarding the proposed language to the Village. At least 45 days, but not more
than 60 days following the date of the Village's mailing, the Village shall
schedule and hold a meeting, to make available a forum at which all then
current providers may address any questions, concerns and make reasonable
suggestions regarding the proposed new rules and regulations to the Village.
The Village Engineer shall, following said meeting and the review of the
providers' comments and suggestions, adopt or amend the rules and regulations
in a manner that best serves the Village, for approval by Village Council.
(Ord. O-2204-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 95.07 REGISTRATION TERM.
   The term of each certificate of registration granted under
Chapter 95 shall be valid from the date of issuance until such time as it is
revoked, terminated, has lapsed or is properly amended.
(Ord. O-2204-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 95.08 INDEMNITY.
   Indemnity required. Each certificate of registration issued pursuant to
Chapter 95 shall contain provisions whereby providers agree to defend,
indemnify and hold the Village and its agents, officers, elected officials,
employees, volunteers, and subcontractors harmless from and against all
damages, costs, losses or expenses:
   (A)   For the repair, replacement, or restoration of Village property,
equipment, materials, structures and facilities which are damaged, destroyed or
found to be defective as a result of such provider's acts or omissions; and
   (B)   From and against any and all claims, demands, suits, causes of action,
and judgments:
      (1)   For damage to or loss of the property of any person, and/or the
death, bodily injury, illness, disease, worker's compensation, loss of
services, or loss of income or wages to any person;
      (2)   Arising out of, incident to, concerning or resulting from the act
or omissions of such provider, its agents, employees, and/or subcontractors, in
the performance of activities pursuant to such certificate of registration, no
matter how, or to whom, such loss may occur.
   (C)   In any event, all persons using or occupying the rights of way agree
to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Village as set forth above as a
condition of their use and occupancy of the rights of way, but such requirement
to defend, indemnify and hold harmless shall not extend to the negligence of
the Village or its agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers
and subcontractors, to the extent that the existence of such negligence shall
be proven to exist.
(Ord. O-2204-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 95.09 CIVIL FORFEITURES.
   In addition to any other penalties set forth in this
Chapter 95 and the remedy of specific performance, which may be enforced in a
court of competent jurisdiction, the Mayor may assess an additional penalty of
civil forfeiture for failure to comply with any provision of
Chapter 95. Such penalty shall be a monetary sum, payable to the Village, in
the amount of $500 per 24-hour day of violation and any subsequent portion of a
day less than 24 hours in length. Prior to assessing said penalty, the Village
will provide written notice to the provider detailing the failure to comply
with a specific provision of
Chapter 95. Such notice shall also indicate that said penalty shall be assessed
in 15 calendar days subsequent to the date of receipt if compliance is not
achieved. If a provider desires to challenge such penalty, provider must
request a public hearing before the Village Council within ten days of service
of the notice. Such public hearing shall be held within 30 days of the
provider's request. If provider requests such hearing before the Village
Council, such penalty shall be temporarily suspended. However, if, after the
public hearing, the Village Council determines that provider failed to comply
with the specific provision(s) of
Chapter 95 referenced in the notice, such penalty shall be assessed starting
with the 15 calendar days after receipt of the notice referenced in this
section and continuing each day thereafter until compliance is achieved. The
determination of the Village Council shall be final. The provider may file an
administrative appeal pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506. The penalty shall continue
to accrue during the appeal unless the provider obtains a stay and posts a
supersedeas bond pursuant to R.C. § 2505.09 or the provider comes into full
compliance with
Chapter 95.
(Ord. O-2204-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 95.10 TERMINATION OF CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION.
   (A)   Default notice provided. The Village through its Mayor shall give
written notice of default to a provider if the Village, in its sole discretion,
determines that a provider has:
      (1)   Violated any material provision or requirement of the issuance or
acceptance of a certificate of registration or any law and failed to cure as
may be required; or
      (2)   Attempted to evade any provision of the issuance of a certificate
of registration or the acceptance of it; or
      (3)   Practiced any fraud or deceit upon Village; or
      (4)   Made a material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
certificate of registration.
   (B)   Cure required. If a provider fails to cure a default within 30
calendar days after such notice is served by the Village then such default
shall be a material default and Village may exercise any remedies or rights it
has at law or in equity to terminate the certificate of registration. If the
Mayor decides there is cause or reason to terminate, the following procedure
shall be followed:
      (1)   Village shall serve a provider with a written notice of the reason
or cause for proposed termination and shall allow a provider a minimum of 15
calendar days to cure its breach.
      (2)   If the provider fails to cure within 15 calendar days, the Village
Engineer may declare the certificate of registration terminated.
      (3)   The provider shall have ten calendar days to appeal the termination
to the Village Council. All such appeals shall be in writing. If the Village
Council determines there was not a breach, then the Village Council shall
overturn the decision of the Mayor. Otherwise, the Village Council shall affirm
the decision of the Mayor to terminate. The determination of the Village
Council shall be final.
(Ord. O-2204-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 95.11 UNAUTHORIZED USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS OF WAY.
   (A)   No use without authorization. No person shall use the rights of way to
operate a system that has not been authorized by the Village in accordance with
the terms of
Chapter 95 and been issued a certificate of registration.
   (B)   No use without certificate of registration. No person shall place or
have placed any facilities in, on, above, within, over, below, under, or
through the rights of way, unless allowed under
Chapter 95 or having been issued a certificate of registration.
   (C)   Unauthorized use a violation. Each and every unauthorized use shall be
deemed to be a violation and a distinct and separate offense. Each and every
day any violation of
Chapter 95 continues shall constitute a distinct and separate offense.
   (D)   Distinct and separate offense. No person shall fail to comply with the
provisions of
Chapter 95. Each and every failure to comply shall be deemed a distinct and
separate offense. Each and every day any violation of
Chapter 95 continues shall constitute a distinct and separate offense.
   (E)   Penalty assessed. The violation of any provision of
Chapter 95 shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor offense. The penalty for any
violation of
Chapter 95 shall be as provided in §
95.99.

§ 95.12 ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP AND RENEWAL.
   (A)   Assignment or transfer approval required. A certificate of
registration shall not be assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part,
other than to an affiliate, without the prior written consent of the Village,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any assignment or transfer of
certificate of registration, including an assignment or transfer by means of a
fundamental corporate change, requires the written approval of the Village.
   (B)   Procedure to request assignment or transfer approval. The parties to
the assignment or transfer of certificate of registration shall make a written
request to the Village for its consent in the form of the certificate of
registration application. The Village shall reply in writing within 60 days of
actual receipt of the request and shall indicate its approval of the request or
its determination that a public hearing is necessary. Village may conduct a
public hearing on the request within 30 days of such determination if it
determines that a sale or transfer of the certificate of registration adversely
affects the Village.
   (C)   Notice and hearing. Notice of a hearing shall be given 14 days prior
to the hearing by publishing notice thereof once in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Village. The notice shall contain the date, time and place
of the hearing and shall briefly state the substance of the action to be
considered by Village.
   (D)   Review by Village. The Village will review the qualifications
(including, but not limited to legal, technical and financial where
appropriate) of the proposed assignee or transferee and terms of the existing
certificate of registration. Village will make its decision in writing setting
forth any conditions for assignment or transfer. Within 120 days of actual
receipt of the request for assignment or transfer, the Village shall approve or
deny such assignment or transfer request in writing.
   (E)   Fundamental corporate change. For purposes of this section,
fundamental corporate change means the sale or transfer of a controlling
interest in the stock of a corporation or the sale or transfer of all or a
majority of a corporation's assets, merger (including a parent and its
subsidiary corporation), consolidation or creation of a subsidiary corporation.
For the purposes of this section, fundamental partnership change means the sale

partner in a limited partnership, change from a limited to a general
partnership, incorporation of a partnership, or change in the control of a
partnership.
   (F)   Certificate of registration and assignee/transferee replacement
issuance required.  In no event shall a transfer or assignment of ownership or
control be ultimately acceptable to the Village without transferee or assignee
requesting and being issued a replacement certificate of registration within 90
days of transfer or assignment.
   (G)   Not a transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no such
consent or approval shall be required for a transfer or assignment to any
person controlling, controlled by or under the same common control of the
original holder of the certificate of registration.
(Ord. O-2204-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 95.13 CONSTRUCTION PERMITS.
   (A)   Construction permit requirement. Except as otherwise provided in the
code, no person may construct in any rights of way without first having
obtained a construction permit as set forth below. This requirement shall be in
addition to any requirement set forth in
Chapter 92 of the code.
      (1)   A construction permit allows the permittee to construct in that
part of the rights of way described in such construction permit and to obstruct
travel over the specified portion of the rights of way by placing facilities
described therein, to the extent and for the duration specified therein.
      (2)   A construction permit is valid only for the dates and the area of
rights of way specified in the construction permit.
      (3)   No permittee may construct in the rights of way beyond the date or
dates specified in the construction permit unless such permittee:
            (a)   Submits a supplementary application for another construction
permit before the expiration of the initial construction permit; and
            (b)   Is granted a new construction permit or construction permit
extension.
      (4)   Original construction permits issued pursuant to §
95.13 shall, when possible, be conspicuously displayed at all times at the
indicated work site and shall be available for inspection by inspectors and
authorized Village personnel. If the original construction permit involves work
conducted simultaneously at multiple locations, each location shall display a
photocopy of the original construction permit. If the original construction
permit is not conspicuously displayed at the indicated work site, then upon
request, the original construction permit must be produced within 12 hours or
the first earliest business hour, whichever is later. For purposes of this
section, business hour shall mean the hours between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
during a business day.
   (B)   Construction permit applications.
      (1)   Application for a construction permit shall be made to the Village
Fiscal Officer.
      (2)   All construction permit applications shall contain, and will be
considered complete only upon compliance with the requirements of the following
provisions:
         (a)   Credible evidence that the applicant (where required) has been
issued a certificate of registration or proof that the applicant has written
authority to apply for a construction permit on behalf of a party that has been
issued a certificate of registration; and
         (b)   Submission of a completed construction permit application in the
form required by the Village, including, but not limited to, all required
attachments, and dated drawings showing the location and area of the proposed
project, number and location of street cuts, and the location of all then known
existing and proposed facilities of the applicant or provider within the
proposed project area. All drawings, plans and specifications submitted with
the application shall comply with applicable technical codes, rules and
regulations and be certified as to being in such compliance by trained
technical personnel acceptable to the Village Engineer. The mapping data is
only required to be at the “atlas” level of detail necessary for the Village to
reasonably determine the location of the provider's facilities in the rights of
way. The Village reserves the right, in circumstances that the Village Engineer
considers unique, complex or unusual, to request that certain submitted
drawings, plans and specifications be accompanied by the certification of a
registered licensed professional engineer; and
         (c)   A Village approved traffic control plan demonstrating the
protective measures and devices that will be employed, consistent with the
OMUTCD, to prevent injury or damage to persons or property and to minimize
disruptions to efficient pedestrian and vehicular traffic; and
         (d)   If the applicant wants to install new facilities, if
specifically requested by the Village Engineer, evidence that there is no
surplus space and evidence that the applicant has received an appropriate
permit and is adhering to the Village's rules and regulations; and
         (e)   If applicant is proposing an above ground installation on
existing poles within the rights of way, the applicant shall provide credible
information satisfactory to the Village to sufficiently detail and identify:
              1.   The size and height of the existing poles; and

         (g)   If applicant is proposing an underground installation in
existing ducts or conduits within the rights of way, the applicant shall
provide credible information satisfactory to the Village to sufficiently detail
and identify:
            1.   Based on the existing facilities, the excess capacity for like
or similar facilities currently available in such ducts or conduits before
installation of applicant's facilities; and
            2.   Based on existing facilities, the excess capacity for like or
similar facilities that will exist in such ducts or conduits after installation
of applicant's facilities.
         (h)   If applicant is proposing an underground installation within new
ducts or conduits to be constructed within the rights of way, the applicant
must provide a utility engineering study that satisfies the requirements of §
95.14 and meets any additional plan submittal requirements of the Village
Engineer and also credible information satisfactory to the Village to
sufficiently detail and identify:
            1.   The location, depth, size, and quantity of proposed new ducts
or conduits; and
            2.   The excess capacity for like or similar equipment that will

         (k)   When a construction permit is requested for purposes of
installing additional systems or any part of a system, the posting of a
construction bond and removal bond, acceptable to the Village and subject to
Chapter 95, for the additional systems or any part of a system is required.
         (l)   Upon request, the Village Engineer may modify or waive the
information requirements if they are not necessary in evaluating the
construction permit application. The Village Engineer may request applicable
and pertinent additional information if it is necessary in evaluating the
construction permit application.
   (C)   Issuance of permit; conditions.
      (1)   If the Village determines that the applicant has satisfied the
requirements of
Chapter 95 and the construction permit process, the Village shall issue a
construction permit subject to the provisions of §
95.13(C)(2).
       (2)   The Village may impose reasonable conditions upon the issuance of
the construction permit and the performance of the permittee thereunder in
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to insure the
structural integrity of the rights of way, to protect the property and safety
of other users of the rights of way, and to minimize the disruption and
inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (D)   Construction permit fees.
      (1)   The Village shall annually calculate construction permit fees and
appropriately revise any prior year's construction permit fees based upon the
formula and calculations described in §
95.13(D). Construction permit fees shall remain in effect until the Village's
next annual modification of the construction permit fees.
      (2)   The Village, on or about January 1 of each year, shall calculate
all the actual and incurred construction permit issuance, inspection,
oversight, enforcement and regulation costs for the previous calendar year
including the value of the degradation and reduction in the useful life of the
rights of way that will result from construction that takes place therein.
“Degradation and the reduction in the useful life” for the purpose of this
section means the accelerated depreciation of the rights of way caused by
construction in or disturbance of the rights of way, resulting in the need to
reconstruct or repair such rights of way earlier than would be required if the
construction did not occur.
      (3)   The Village, on or about January 1 of each year, shall total all
the construction permit fee receipts received in accordance with the scheduled
fees required by the prior year's construction permit fees for the previous
calendar year.
      (4)   The Village shall divide the calculated costs referenced in §
95.13(D)(2) by the total construction permit fees received as referenced in §
95.13(D)(3) to arrive at a numerical factor representing the previous years
cost versus receipts analysis.
      (5)   The Village shall multiply the then currently codified construction
permit fees by the numerical factor as referenced in §
95.13(D)(4) to calculate revised permit fees for the new calendar year.
      (6)   The Village shall act, on or about January 31 of each year, in
accordance with the results of §
95.13(D)(5), to codify new annual permit fees by separate legislation enacted
by Council by appropriately increasing or decreasing the previous years permit
fees. Revised permit fees shall be effective upon passage. Any permit requests
pending on the date of any annual permit fee modification shall be subject to
all new permit fees as modified.
      (7)   Except as provided in subsection §
95.13(D)(8), no construction permit shall be issued without payment of
construction permit fees except to the Village which shall be exempt.
Construction permit fees that were paid for a permit that the Village has
revoked due to breach and in accordance with the terms of §
95.10 or §
95.16(E) are not refundable.
      (8)   The Village Fiscal Officer may permit a provider to make quarterly
payments of construction permit fees based upon the provider's financial
condition and past payment history. The quarterly payment shall be due and
payable within 30 days after the end of the quarter. The Village Fiscal Officer
may revoke this permission due to a change in financial condition, late
payment, or other just cause.
   (E)   Joint applications. Applicants are encouraged to submit joint
applications for construction permits to work in the rights of way at the same
place and time. Joint applicants shall have the ability to divide amongst
themselves, in proportions the parties find appropriate, any applicable
construction permit fees.
(Ord. O-2204-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 95.14 CONSTRUCTION, RELOCATION AND RESTORATION.
   (A)   Utility engineering study required.
      (1)   Prior to commencement of any initial construction, extension, or
relocation of facilities in the rights of way, except for repair, maintenance
or replacement with like facilities or relocations requested or caused by a
third party (excluding the Village) or another permittee, a permittee shall
conduct a utility engineering study on the proposed route of construction
expansion or relocation if requested by the Village Engineer. Where such
construction and/or relocation is requested or caused by a third party, every
permittee located within the rights of way at issue or involved with the work
shall use all best efforts to cooperate and assist any other permittee or
person who is directed by the Village to perform the required utility
engineering study. A utility engineering study consists of, at minimum,
completion of the following tasks:
         (a)   Secure all available “as-built” plans, plats and other location
data indicating the existence and approximate location of all facilities along
the proposed construction route.
         (b)   Visibly survey and record the location and dimensions of any
facilities along the proposed construction route, including, but not limited
to, manholes, valve boxes, utility boxes, posts and visible street cut repairs.
         (c)   Determine and record the presence and precise location of all
underground facilities the applicant or person on whose behalf the permit was
applied for owns or controls in the rights of way along the proposed system
route. Upon request of the Village Engineer, a permittee shall also record and
identify the general location of all other facilities in the rights of way
along the proposed system route. For the purposes of this section, general
location shall mean the alignment of other facilities in the rights of way, but
shall not necessarily mean the depth of other facilities in the rights of way.
         (d)   Plot and incorporate the data obtained from completion of the
tasks described in §
95.14(A)(1)(a) through (A)(1)(c) on the construction permittee's proposed
system route maps and construction plans, along with the locations of the
proposed facilities and all other topographic and cadastral information.
         (e)   Where the proposed location of facilities and the location of
existing underground facilities appear to conflict on the plans drafted in
accordance with §
95.14(A)(1)(d), permittee has the option of either utilizing non-destructive
digging methods, such as vacuum excavation, at the critical points identified
to determine as precisely as possible, the horizontal, vertical and spatial
position, composition, size and other specifications of the conflicting
underground facilities, or re-designing the construction plans to eliminate the
apparent conflict. Unless waived by the Village Engineer, a permittee shall not
excavate more than a 12 inch hole in the rights of way to complete this task
for each apparent conflict. Any surfaces damaged shall be immediately repaired
by the permittee. A minimum of two working days notice shall be provided to the
Village prior to performing these investigations.
         (f)   Based on all of the data collected upon completion of the tasks
described in this section, adjust the proposed system design to avoid the need
to relocate other underground facilities.
      (2)   The Village Engineer may modify the scope of the utility
engineering study as necessary depending on the proposed construction plans.
   (B)   Copy to Village. Upon completion of the tasks described in §
95.14(A), the construction permittee shall submit, if necessary labeled in
accordance with the requirements of §
95.06(b), the proposed system route maps and construction plans, with the
results of the utility engineering study, in the most advanced format
(including, but not be limited to electronic and/or digital format) then
currently being used by the provider that is then currently capable of
technologically being read (or readily converted to a readable form) by the
Village. The mapping data is only required to be at the “atlas” level of detail
necessary for the Village to reasonably determine the location of the
provider's facilities in the rights of way. The provider shall supply the
mapping data on paper if the Village Engineer determines that the format
currently being used by the provider is not capable of being read by the
Village.
   (C)   Qualified firm. All utility engineering studies conducted pursuant to
this section shall be performed by the permittee if in the discretion of the
Village Engineer the construction permittee is qualified to complete the
project itself, alternatively utility engineering studies shall be performed by
a firm specializing in utility engineering.
   (D)   Cost of study. The permittee shall bear the cost of compliance with §
95.14(A) through (C).
   (E)   Construction schedule. Unless otherwise provided for in
Chapter 95 or in the rules and regulations, or unless the Village Engineer
waives any of the requirements of this section due to unique or unusual
circumstances, a permittee shall be required to submit a written construction
schedule to the Village not less than five working days before commencing any
work in or about the rights of way, and shall further notify the Village not
less than two working days in advance of any excavation in the rights of way.
This section shall apply to all situations with the exception of circumstances
under §
95.16(D)(1) (emergency situations) and §
95.15 (minor maintenance).
   (F)   Location of facilities
      (1)   The placement of new facilities and replacement of old facilities,
either above ground or underground, shall be completed in conformity with
applicable laws and the Village's rules and regulations. Detailed plans and
applicable specifications shall be submitted to the Village for review and
approval prior to construction of any facilities except those that are
categorized as “minor maintenance” issues as per §
95.15 herein.
      (2)   The Village shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement
of new or additional facilities within the rights of way if the right of way is
full. In making such decisions, the Village shall strive to the extent possible
to accommodate all existing and potential users of the rights of way, but shall
be guided primarily by considerations of the public health, safety and welfare,
the condition of the rights of way, the time of year with respect to essential
utilities, the protection of existing facilities in the rights of way, future
Village and County plans for public improvements, development projects which
have been determined to be in the public interest and nondiscriminatory and
competitively neutral treatment among providers.
   (G)   Least disruptive technology. All construction or maintenance of
facilities shall be accomplished in the manner resulting in the least amount of
damage and disruption of the rights of way. Specifically, every permittee when
performing underground construction, if technically and/or technologically
feasible and not economically unreasonable, shall utilize trenchless
technology, including, but not limited to, horizontal drilling, directional
boring, or microtunneling of pavement, driveways, and other sensitive
topographic areas. In addition, all cable, wire or fiber optic cable installed
in the subsurface rights of way pursuant to
Chapter 95 may be required to be installed in conduit, and if so required, no
cable, wire or fiber optic cable may be installed pursuant to
Chapter 95 using “direct bury” techniques.
   (H)   Special exceptions. The Village may grant a special exception to the
requirements of §
95.14(F) and §
95.14(G) if a permittee, upon application, demonstrates with written evidence
that:
      (1)   The exception will not create any threat to the public health,
safety or welfare.
      (2)   Permittee demonstrates that the increased economic burden and the
potential adverse impact on the permittee's construction schedule resulting
from the strict enforcement of the requirement actually or effectively inhibits
the ability of the permittee to provide services in the Village.
      (3)   The permittee demonstrates that the requirement unreasonably
discriminates against the permittee in favor of another person.
      (4)   The requirements requested by the Village herein create an
unreasonable economic burden for the permittee that outweighs any potential
benefit to the Village.
   (I)   Relocation of facilities.
      (1)   A provider shall as promptly as reasonably possible and at its own
expense, permanently remove and relocate its facilities in the rights of way
whenever the Village finds it necessary to request such removal and relocation.
In instances where the Village requests removal and/or relocation, the Village
shall waive all applicable construction permit fees. Upon removal and/or
relocation, the provider shall restore the rights of way to the same or better
condition it was in prior to said removal or relocation. If existing poles are
required to be removed and/or relocated, then the existing poles will be
replaced with poles of the same or similar size. In accordance with law, the
Village may request relocation and/or removal in order to prevent unreasonable
interference by the provider's facilities with:
         (a)   A public improvement undertaken or approved by the Village.
         (b)   When the public health, safety, and welfare requires it, or when
necessary to prevent interference with the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel over the rights of way.
         (c)   The sale, conveyance, vacation, or narrowing of all or any part
of a right of way.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider who has facilities in the
rights of way subject to a vacation or narrowing that is not required for the
purposes of the Village, shall have a permanent easement in such vacated
portion or excess portion in conformity with R.C. § 723.041.
      (3)   If, in the reasonable judgment of the Village, a provider fails to
commence removal and/or relocation of its facilities as designated by the
Village, within 30 days after the Village's removal order, or if a provider
fails to substantially complete such removal, including all associated repair
of the rights of way of the Village, within 12 months thereafter, then, to the
extent not inconsistent with applicable law, the Village shall have the right
to:
         (a)   Declare that all rights, title and interest to the facilities
belong to the Village with all rights of ownership, including, but not limited
to, the right to connect and use the facilities or to effect a transfer of all
right, title and interest in the facilities to another person for operation; or
         (b)   Authorize removal of the facilities installed by the provider
in, on, over or under the rights of way of the Village at provider's cost and
expense, by another person; however, the Village shall have no liability for
any damage caused by such action and the provider shall be liable to the
Village for all reasonable costs incurred by the Village in such action; and
         (c)   To the extent consistent with applicable law, any portion of the
provider's facilities in, on, over or under the rights of way of the Village
designated by the Village for removal and not timely removed by the provider
shall belong to and become the property of the Village without payment to the
provider, and the provider shall execute and deliver such documents, as the
Village shall request, in form and substance acceptable to the Village, to
evidence such ownership by the Village.
   (J)   Pre-excavation facilities location.
      (1)   Before the start date of any rights of way excavation, each
provider who has facilities located in the area to be excavated shall, to the
best of its ability, mark the horizontal and approximate vertical placement of
all its facilities.
      (2)   All providers shall notify and work closely with the excavation
contractor in an effort to establish the exact location of its facilities and
the best procedure for excavation.
   (K)   Rights of way restoration.
      (1)   The work to be done under the permit, and the restoration of the
rights of way as required herein, weather permitting, must be completed within
the dates specified in the permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee
must restore the general area of the work, and the surrounding areas, including
trench backfill, paving and its foundations in accordance with the code and
rules and regulations. If a permittee is unable to timely complete the
restoration of rights of way due to unreasonable inclement weather conditions,
the permittee shall provide interim surface restoration as directed by the
engineer, and complete the restoration of the rights of way as soon as weather
conditions make it possible to do so and upon said completion notify the
Village.
      (2)   In approving an application for a construction permit, the Village
may choose either to have the permittee restore the rights of way or
alternatively to restore the rights of way itself if the permittee has in the
past not abided by requirements of
Chapter 95.
      (3)   If the Village allows a permittee to restore the rights of way, the
permittee may at the time of application for a construction permit be required
to post a construction bond in an amount submitted by the permittee with a
detailed cost breakdown to the Village Engineer for approval that is sufficient
to cover the cost of restoring the rights of way to its approximate pre-
excavation condition. If, 12 months after completion of the restoration of the
rights of way, the Village determines that the rights of way have been properly
restored, the surety on the construction bond shall be released.
      (4)   The permittee shall perform the work according to the standards and
with the materials specified by the Village. The Village shall have the
authority to prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration, and may do so
in written procedures of general application or on a case-by-case basis. The
Village in exercising this authority shall be guided by the following standards
and considerations: the number, size, depth and duration of the excavations,
disruptions or damage to the rights of way; the traffic volume carried by the
rights of way; the character of the neighborhood surrounding the rights of way;
the pre-excavation condition of the rights of way; the remaining life-
expectancy of the rights of way affected by the excavation; whether the
relative cost of the method of restoration to the permittee is in reasonable
balance with the prevention of an accelerated depreciation of the rights of way
that would otherwise result from the excavation, disturbance or damage to the
rights of way; and the likelihood that the particular method of restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the rights of way that would
otherwise take place. Methods of restoration may include, but are not limited
to, patching the affected area, replacement of the rights of way base at the
affected area, and in the most severe cases; milling, overlay and/or street
reconstruction of the entire area of the rights of way affected by the work.
      (5)   By restoring the rights of way itself, the permittee guarantees its
work and shall maintain it for 12 months following its completion. During this
12 month period, it shall, upon notification from the Mayor, correct all
restoration work to the extent necessary using the method required by the
Village Engineer. Weather permitting, said work shall be completed within five
calendar days of the receipt of the notice from the Mayor, unless otherwise
extended by the Mayor.
      (6)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights of way in the manner
and to the condition required by the Village, or fails to satisfactorily and
timely complete all repairs required by the Village, the Village, at its
option, may do such work. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the
Village, within 30 days of billing, the restoration cost of restoring the
rights of way and any other costs incurred by the Village. Upon failure to pay,
the Village may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted by permittee and/
or pursue any and all legal and equitable remedies.
      (7)   If the work to be done under the permit is being done at the same
location and the same period of time as work by the Village and/ or another
permitee(s), then the Mayor may reasonably apportion the restoration
responsibility among the Village, providers and/or other persons.
   (L)   Damage to other facilities.
       (1)   In the case of an emergency, and if possible after reasonable
efforts to contact the provider seeking a timely response, when the Village
performs work in the rights of way and finds it necessary, as may be allowed by
law, to maintain, support, or move a provider's facilities to protect those
facilities, the costs associated therewith will be billed to that provider and
shall be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Upon failure to pay, the
Village may pursue all legal and equitable remedies in the event a provider
does not pay or the Village may call upon any bond or letter of credit posted
by the permittee and pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies. Each
provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the
facilities of another provider caused during the Village's response to an
emergency occasioned by that provider's facilities.
      (2)   Each provider shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any
Village-owned facilities in the rights of way which the provider or its
facilities damage.
   (M)   Rights of way vacation. If the Village sells or otherwise transfers a
rights of way which contains the facilities of a provider, such sale or
transfer shall be subject to any existing easements of record and any easements
required pursuant to R.C. § 723.041.
   (N)   Installation requirements. The excavation, backfilling, restoration,
and all other work performed in the rights of way shall be performed in
conformance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, other standards as
may be promulgated by the Village Engineer.
   (O)   Inspection. When the construction under any permit hereunder is
completed, the permittee shall notify the Village.
      (1)   The permittee shall make the construction site available to the
inspector and to all others as authorized by law for inspection at all
reasonable times during the execution and upon completion of the construction.
      (2)   At the time of inspection, the inspector may order the immediate
cessation of any work which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety
or well-being of the public, violates any law or which violates the term and
conditions of the permit and/or
Chapter 95.
      (3)   The inspector may issue an order to the permittee for any work
which does not conform to the permit and/or applicable standards, conditions or
codes. The order shall state that failure to correct the violation will be
cause for revocation of the permit. The order may be served on the permittee as
provided in §
95.19(B). An order may be appealed to the Mayor. The decision of the Mayor may
be appealed to the Village Council whose decision shall be final. If not
appealed, within ten days after issuance of the order, the provider shall
present proof to the Mayor that the violation has been corrected. If such proof
has not been presented within the required time, the Mayor may revoke the
permit pursuant to §
95.16(E).
   (P)   Other obligations.
      (1)   Obtaining a construction permit does not relieve permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to pay
all fees required by any other laws.
      (2)   Permittee shall comply with all requirements of all laws, including
the Ohio Utility Protection Service.
      (3)   Permittee shall perform all work in conformance with all applicable
laws and standards, and is responsible for all work done in the rights of way
pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work.
      (4)   No rights of way obstruction or excavation may be performed when
seasonally prohibited or when conditions are unreasonable for such work, except
in the case of an emergency as outlined in §
95.16(D)(1).
      (5)   Permittee shall not obstruct a rights of way so that the natural
free and clear passage of water through the gutters or other waterways shall be
interfered with. The Village Engineer may waive this requirement if it is
technically or economically unreasonable in the circumstances.
      (6)   Private vehicles other than necessary construction vehicles may not
be parked within or adjacent to a permit area. The loading or unloading of
trucks adjacent to a permit area is prohibited unless specifically authorized
by the permit.
   (Q)   Undergrounding required. Any owner of property abutting upon a street
or alley where service facilities are now located underground and where the
service connection is at the property line, shall install or cause others to
install underground any service delivery infrastructure from the property line
to the buildings or other structures on such property to which such service is
supplied. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground by
Chapter 95, a provider shall locate facilities underground at the request of an
adjacent property owner, provided that such placement of facilities underground
is consistent with the provider's normal construction and operating standards
and that the additional costs of such undergrounding over the normal aerial or
above ground placement costs of identical facilities are borne directly by the
property owner making the request. A provider, under any circumstance shall,
upon the reasonable request of the Village, always use best efforts to place
facilities underground. Where technically possible and not economically
unreasonable or unsafe (based upon the technology employed and facilities
installed), all facilities to be installed by a provider under the right of way
shall be installed in conduit.
(Ord. O-2204-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 95.15 MINOR MAINTENANCE PERMIT.
   (A)   Right of way minor maintenance permit requirement. No person shall
perform minor maintenance of facilities in the rights of way without first
having obtained a right of way minor maintenance permit as set forth in this
chapter. Minor maintenance means: (i) the routine repair or replacement of
facilities with like facilities not involving construction and not requiring
traffic control for more than two hours at any one location; (ii) or the
routine repair or replacement of facilities with like facilities not involving
construction and taking place on thoroughfares and arteries between the hours
of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.; (iii) or the routine repair or replacement of
facilities with like facilities not involving construction on all rights of
ways, other than thoroughfares and arterials, that does not impede traffic and
is for a period of less than eight contiguous hours; (iv) or construction other
than on thoroughfares and arterials that takes less than eight contiguous hours
to complete, does not impede traffic and does not involve a pavement cut; or
(v) minor and/or non-material vegetation management/tree pruning. The Village
Engineer may adopt rules and regulations pursuant to §
95.06(E) that clarify the definition of minor maintenance and/or provide a
process for a provider to determine whether particular activity constitutes
minor maintenance.
      (1)   A right of way minor maintenance permit allows the right of way
minor maintenance permittee to perform all minor maintenance in any part of the
rights of way as required.
      (2)   A right of way minor maintenance permit is valid from the date of
issuance until revoked by the Village Engineer.
      (3)   A right of way minor maintenance permit must be displayed or upon
request produced within 12 business hours.
      (4)   A right of way minor maintenance permit by itself shall under no
circumstances provide a permittee with the ability to cut pavement without
seeking additional authority from the Village Engineer.
   (B)   Right of way minor maintenance permit applications. Application for a
right of way minor maintenance permit shall be made to the Village Fiscal
Officer. In addition to any information required by the Village, all right of
way minor maintenance permit applications shall contain, and will only be
considered complete upon compliance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Credible evidence that the applicant has obtained a certificate of
registration or proof that the applicant has written authority to apply for a
right of way minor maintenance permit on behalf of a party that has been issued
a certificate of registration.
      (2)   Submission of a completed right of way minor maintenance permit
application in the form required by the Village.
      (3)   A statement that the applicant will employ protective measures and
devices that, consistent with the OMUTCD, will prevent injury or damage to
persons or property and to minimize disruptions to the efficient movement of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
   (C)   Issuance of right of way minor maintenance permits; conditions.
      (1)   If the Village Engineer determines that the applicant has satisfied
the requirements of this chapter and the right of way minor maintenance permit
process, the Village Engineer shall issue a right of way minor maintenance
permit subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      (2)   The Village may impose reasonable conditions, in addition to the
rules and regulations enacted by the Village Engineer, upon the issuance of the
right of way minor maintenance permit and the performance of the right of way
minor maintenance permittee thereunder in order to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, to insure the structural integrity of the rights of way,
to protect the property and safety of other users of the rights of way, and to
minimize the disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public.
   (D)   Right of way minor maintenance permit fees. The Village shall not
charge a fee for the issuance of the right of way minor maintenance permit but

§ 95.16 ENFORCEMENT OF PERMIT OBLIGATION.
   (A)   Mandatory denial of permit. Except in the case of an emergency, no
permit will be granted:
      (1)   To any person who has not yet made an application; or
      (2)   To any person who has outstanding debt owed to the Village unless
payment in full has been placed in an escrow account approved by the Village
Fiscal Officer and the Village Solicitor; or
      (3)   To any person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of
a permit; or
      (4)   If, in the discretion of the Village Engineer, the issuance of a
permit for the particular date and/or time would cause a conflict or interfere
with an exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. The Village
Engineer, in exercising this discretion, shall be guided by the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel of the public over the rights of way, and by
considerations relating to the public health, safety and welfare.
   (B)   Permissive denial of permit. The Village Engineer may deny a permit in
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare, to prevent interference
with the safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the rights of way, or
when necessary to protect the rights of way and its users.
      (1)   The Village Engineer, in his or her discretion, may consider one or
more of the following factors:
         (a)   The extent to which rights of way space where the permit is
sought is available; and/or
         (b)   The competing demands for the particular space in the rights of
way; and/or
         (c)   The availability of other locations in the rights of way or in
other rights of way for the proposed facilities; and/or
         (d)   The applicability of
Chapter 95 or other regulations of the rights of way that affect location of
facilities in the rights of way; and/or
         (e)   The degree of compliance of the provider with the terms and
conditions of its certificate of registration,
Chapter 95, and other applicable ordinances and regulations; and/or
         (f)   The degree of disruption to surrounding communities and
businesses that will result from the use of that part of the rights of way;
and/or
         (g)   The condition and age of the rights of way, and whether and when
it is scheduled for total or partial re-construction; and/or
          (h)   The balancing of the costs of disruption to the public and
damage to the rights of way, against the benefits to that part of the public
served by the expansion into additional parts of the rights of way; and/or
         (i)   Whether such applicant or its agent has failed within the past
three years to comply, or is presently not in full compliance with, the
requirements of
Chapter 95 or, if applicable, any other law.
      (2)   Under no circumstances will open cutting take place on a newly
constructed street within 24 months after construction completion or a newly
reconstructed street within 24 months of reconstruction completion, except
where:
         (a)   An emergency situation requires that an open cut is necessary;
and/or
         (b)   Vital services to resident(s) or business(es) are needed or have
been cut off and there is no reasonable alternative (such as jacking or boring)
in supplying or restoring such services; and/or
         (c)   The Village Engineer determines it is in the best interests of
the Village that such an open cut take place.
   (C)   Discretionary issuance of permit. 
      (1)   Notwithstanding the provisions of §
95.16(A)(1) and §
95.16(A)(2), the Village Engineer may issue a permit in any case where the
permit is necessary;
         (a)   To prevent substantial economic hardship to a customer of the
permit applicant, if established by credible evidence satisfactory to the
Village; or
         (b)   To allow such customer to materially improve its service; or
         (c)   To allow a new economic development project to be granted a
permit under this section.
      (2)   To be granted a permit under this section, the permit applicant
must not have had knowledge of the hardship, the plans for improvement of
service, or the development project when it was required to submit its list of
next year projects.
   (D)   Work done without a permit in emergency situations.
      (1)   Each provider shall, as soon as is practicable, immediately notify
the Village Fiscal Officer of any event regarding its facilities which it
considers to be an emergency. The provider may proceed to take whatever actions
are necessary in order to respond to the emergency. Within five business days,
unless otherwise extended by the Village Engineer, after the occurrence or
discovery of the emergency (whichever is later), the provider shall apply for
the necessary permits, pay the fees associated therewith and fulfill the rest
of the requirements necessary to bring itself into compliance with
Chapter 95 for any and all actions taken in response to the emergency. In the
event that the Village becomes aware of an emergency regarding a provider's
facilities, the Village shall use best efforts to contact the provider or the
system representative of each provider affected, or potentially affected, by
the emergency. In any event, the Village may take whatever action it deems
necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which shall be
borne by the provider whose facilities caused the emergency.
      (2)   Except in the case of an emergency, any provider who constructs in,
on, above, within, over, below or through a rights of way without a valid
permit must subsequently obtain a permit, pay double the normal fee for said
permit, pay double all the other fees required by the code, deposit with the
Village the fees necessary to correct any damage to the rights of way and
comply with all of the requirements of
Chapter 95.
   (E)   Revocation of permits.
      (1)   Permittees hold permits issued pursuant to the code as a privilege
and not as a right. The Village reserves its right, as provided herein, to
revoke any permit, without refunding any fees, in the event of a substantial
breach of the terms and conditions of any law, or any provision or condition of
the permit. A substantial breach by permittee shall include, but shall not be
limited to, the following:
         (a)   The violation of any provision or condition of the permit; or
         (b)   An evasion or attempt to evade any provision or condition of the
permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud or deceit upon
the Village or its citizens; or
         (c)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the application for a
permit; or
         (d)   The failure to maintain the required construction or removal
bonds and/or insurance; or
         (e)   The failure to obtain and/or maintain, when required, a
certificate of registration; or
         (f)   The failure to complete the construction in a timely manner; or
         (g)   The failure to correct a condition of an order issued pursuant
to §
95.14(O)(3).
      (2)   If the Village Engineer determines that the permittee has committed
a substantial breach of a term or condition of any law or any condition of the
permit, the Village Engineer shall serve a written demand upon the permittee to
remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued violations may be
cause for revocation of the permit. Upon a substantial breach, as stated above,
the Village Engineer may place additional or revised conditions on the permit.
      (3)   By the close of the second business day following receipt of
notification of the breach, permittee shall contact the Village Engineer with a
plan, acceptable to the Village Engineer, for its correction. Permittee's
failure to so contact the Village Engineer, or the permittee's failure to
submit an acceptable plan, or permittee's failure to reasonably implement the
approved plan, shall be cause for immediate revocation of the permit.
      (4)   If a permittee commits a second substantial default as outlined
above, permittee's permit will automatically be revoked and the permittee will
not be allowed further permits for up to and including one full year, except
for emergency repairs.
      (5)   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall also reimburse the
Village for the Village's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the
costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with
such revocation.
(Ord. O-2204-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 95.17 CONSTRUCTION AND REMOVAL BONDS.
   (A)   Construction bond. Prior to the commencement of any construction, a
construction permittee, excluding the City of Columbus and the County, shall
deposit with the Village an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit and/or
surety bond in an amount determined by the Mayor to be appropriate based upon
fair and reasonable criteria. Unless a construction default, problem or
deficiency involves an emergency or endangers the safety of the general public,
the Village shall serve written notice to the construction permittee detailing
the construction default, problem or deficiency. If the Village determines that
correction or repair of the construction default, problem or deficiency has not
occurred or has not been substantially initiated within ten calendar days after
the date following service and notification and detailing the construction
default, problem or deficiency, then the Village may attach the letter of
credit or surety bond. Upon attachment, written notice shall be served on the
construction permittee by the Village.
   (B)   Removal bond. Upon issuance of a certificate of registration and
continuously thereafter, and until 120 days after a provider's facilities have
been removed from the rights of way, (unless the Village notifies the provider
that a reasonably longer period shall apply), a provider shall deposit with the
Village and maintain an irrevocable, unconditional letter of credit or surety
bond in an amount equal to or greater than $100,000, the Village shall make all
reasonable efforts to allow provider a period of five calendar days after
serving notification in writing to correct or repair any default, problem or
deficiency prior to the Village attachment of the letter of credit or surety
bond regarding the removal of facilities. Upon attachment, written notice shall
be provided to the provider by the Village.
   (C)   Blanket bond. In lieu of the construction bond required by §
95.17(A) and the removal bond required by §
95.17(B), provider may deposit with the Village an irrevocable, unconditional
letter of credit and/or surety bond in the amount of $5,000,000. Unless a
construction default, problem or deficiency involves an emergency or endangers
the safety of the general public, the Village shall make all reasonable effort
to allow permittee a period of five calendar days after sending notification in
writing to correct or repair any default, problem or deficiency prior to
Village's attachment of the letter of credit or surety bond.
   (D)   Self bonding. In lieu of the construction bond required by §
95.17(A), the removal bond required by §
95.17(B) and the blanket bond required by §
95.17(C), those providers maintaining a book value in excess of $50,000,000 may
submit a statement to the Village requesting to self-bond. If approval to self-
bond is granted, a provider shall assure the Village that such self-bonding
shall provide the Village with no less protection and security than would have
been afforded to the Village by a third party surety providing provider with
the types and amounts of bonds detailed in the above named sections. This
statement shall include:
      (1)   Audited financial statements for the previous year; and
      (2)   A description of the applicant's self-bonding program.
      (3)   Other applicable and pertinent information as reasonably requested
by the Village.
   (E)   Purposes. The bonds required by this section, and any self bonding to
the extent it has been permitted, shall serve as security for:
      (1)   The faithful performance by the permittee or provider of all terms,
conditions and obligations of
Chapter 95; and
      (2)   Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned
by the permittee or provider's violation of
Chapter 95 or its failure to comply with all rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to
Chapter 95; and
      (3)   The payment of all compensation due to the Village, including
permit fees; and
      (4)   The payment of premiums (if any) for the liability insurance
required pursuant to
Chapter 95; and
      (5)   The removal of facilities from the rights of way pursuant to
Chapter 95; and
      (6)   The payment to the Village of any amounts for which the permittee
or provider is liable that are not paid by its insurance or other surety; and
      (7)   The payment of any other amounts which become due to the Village
pursuant to
Chapter 95 or the law.
   (F)   Form. The bond documents required by this section and any replacement
bond documents shall contain the following endorsement: “it is hereby
understood and agreed that this bond may not be canceled or not renewed by the
surety nor the intention to cancel or not to renew be stated by the surety
until 90 days after completion of construction of the facilities and,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall in no case be canceled or not renewed by
the surety until at least 90 days' written notice to Village of surety's
intention to cancel or not renew this bond.
(Ord. O-2204-09, passed 10-19-09)
§ 95.18 INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY.
   (A)   Village does not accept liability. By reason of the acceptance of an
application, the grant of a permit or the issuance of a certificate of
registration, the Village does not assume any liability:
      (1)   For injuries to persons, damage to property, or loss of service
claims; or
      (2)   For claims or penalties of any sort resulting from the
installation, presence, maintenance or operation of facilities.
   (B)   Indemnification.
      (1)   (a)   By applying for and being issued a certificate of
registration with the Village a provider is required, or by accepting a permit
a permittee is required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Village's
agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors
from all costs, liabilities, claims, and suits for damages of any kind arising
out of the construction, presence, installation, maintenance, repair or
operation of its facilities, or out of any activity undertaken in or near a
rights of way, whether any act or omission complained of is authorized,
allowed, or prohibited by a permit. Such requirement to defend, indemnify and
hold harmless shall not extend to the negligence of the Village or its agents,
elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers and subcontractors, to the
extent that the existence of such negligence shall be proven to exist. A
provider or permittee shall not bring, nor cause to be brought, any action,
suit or other proceeding claiming damages, or seeking any other relief against
the Village's agents, elected officials, officers, employees, volunteers, and
subcontractors for any claim nor for any award arising out of the presence,
installation, maintenance or operation of its facilities, or any activity
undertaken in or near a rights of way, whether the act or omission complained
of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by a permit. This section is not, as to
third parties, a waiver of any defense or immunity otherwise available to the
provider, permittee or to the Village; and the provider or permittee, in
defending any action on behalf of the Village, shall be entitled to assert in
any action every defense or immunity that the Village could assert in its own
behalf. Any and all exercise of the above shall be consistent with, but not
limited to, the following:
         (b)   To the fullest extent permitted by law, all providers and
permittees shall, at their sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Village, its elected officials, agents, officers, employees,
volunteers and subcontractors from and against any and all lawsuits, claims
(including without limitation worker's compensation claims against the Village
or others), causes of actions, actions, liability, and judgments for injury or
damages (including, but not limited to, expenses for reasonable legal fees,
costs and expenses assumed by the Village in connection therewith); and
            1.   Persons or property, in any way arising out of or through the
acts or omissions of provider or permittee, its subcontractors, agents or
employees attributable to the occupation by the provider or permittee of the
rights of way, to which provider's or permittee's negligence shall in any way
contribute, and regardless of whether the Village's negligence or the
negligence of any other party shall have contributed to such claim, cause of
action, judgment, injury or damage; and
            2.   Arising out of any claim for invasion of the right of privacy,
for defamation of person, firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement
of any copyright, trademark, trade name, service mark or patent or any other
right of any person, firm and corporation by the provider, but excluding claims
arising out of or related to the Village's actions; and
            3.   Arising out of provider or permittee's failure to comply with
the provisions of law applicable to provider or permittee in its business
hereunder.
      (2)   The foregoing indemnification is conditioned upon the Village:
         (a)   Giving provider or permittee prompt notice of any claim or the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is
sought; and
         (b)   Affording the provider or permittee the opportunity to jointly
participate in any compromise, settlement, or other resolution or disposition
of any claim or proceeding subject to indemnification; and
         (c)   Cooperate in the defense of such claim and making available to
the provider or permittee all pertinent information under the Village's
control.
      (3)   The Village shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
such action or proceeding and to participate in the investigation and defense
thereof, and the provider or permittee shall pay all reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel if employed.

notice may be sent by regular, preposted, first-class U.S. mail; or
        (6)   If the notice is attempted to be served by regular, first class
U.S. mail, postage prepaid, and the letter is then returned showing that the

the Mayor within 14 calendar days thereof and the provider and/or permittee's
certificate of registration or permit (as applicable) shall be deemed void and
of no further force and effect.
      (2)   The Village shall have the right to revoke, pursuant to the
provisions of the code, any certificate of registration or permit granted

bankruptcy code, 120 days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to
take over and conduct the business of the provider and/or permittee, whether in
receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless
such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of said 120 days or unless:
         (a)   Within 120 days after election or appointment, such receiver or
trustee shall have fully complied with all the provisions of the relevant
certificate of registration, any outstanding permit,
Chapter 95, and remedied all defaults thereunder; and
         (b)   Said receiver or trustee, within said 120 days, shall have
executed an agreement, duly approved by a court having jurisdiction over the
facilities, whereby such receiver or trustee assumes and agrees to be bound by
each and every provision of the relevant certificate of registration, permit
and
Chapter 95.
   (E)   Choice of law and forum. This
Chapter 95 and the terms and conditions of any certificate of registration or
permit shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the substantive laws
of the Village, State of Ohio and United States, in that order. As a condition
of the grant of any permit or issuance of any certificate of registration,
unless otherwise required by law, all disputes shall be resolved in a court of
competent jurisdiction in Franklin County, Ohio.
   (F)   Force majeure. In the event any person's performance of any of the
terms, conditions or obligations required by
Chapter 95 is prevented by a cause or event not within such person's control,
such inability to perform shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions
shall be imposed as a result thereof. For the purpose of this section, causes
or events not within the control of a provider shall include, without

permittee continues to operate all or any part of the facilities after the
termination, lapse, or revocation of a certificate of registration, such
provider or permittee shall continue to comply with all applicable provisions
of this chapter and other laws throughout the period of such continued
operation, provided that any such continued operation shall in no way be
construed as a renewal or other extension of the certificate of registration,
nor as a limitation on the remedies, if any, available to the Village as a
result of such continued operation after the term, including, but not limited
to, damages and restitution. Any conflict between the issuance of a certificate
of registration or of a permit and any other present or future lawful exercise
of the Village's regulatory or police powers shall be resolved in favor of the
latter.

to the Village required by this chapter shall be in writing and sent via
certified U.S. mail to the Mayor or Village Engineer as specified in this
Chapter 95.
   (J)   Village facilities. As part of Village required standards wherever
rights of way are under construction, if deemed advisable and practicable by

right-of-way.
      (1)   No person shall occupy or use the right-of-way except in accordance
with law.
      (2)   In occupying or using the right-of-way, no person shall
unreasonably compromise the public health, safety, and welfare.
      (3)   No person shall occupy or use the right-of-way without first
obtaining any requisite consent of the village. Before placing small cell
facilities or wireless support structures in the right-of-way, an operator must
apply for and receive a general right-of-way permit under this section. This
provision shall not be construed to waive application fees or any other
construction or work permit necessary for work in the village.
      (4)   The foregoing provisions shall not be construed to permit the
construction and operation of wireline backhaul facilities.
   (B)   Pre-application conference.
      (1)   Purpose. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the village
and request a pre-application conference. This meeting will provide an
opportunity for early coordination regarding proposed small cell facilities and
wireless support structure locations and design, and the application submittal
and review process, to avoid any potential delays in the processing of an
application and deployment of small cell facilities and wireless support
structures in the village.

   (D)   Required application materials. Unless otherwise required by state or
federal law, all applicants shall submit to the village materials and
information associated with each application as outlined in the design
guidelines in order for the application to be considered complete.
(Ord. O-2591-19, passed 2-18-19)
§ 96.03 APPLICATION REVIEW TIMEFRAMES AND PROCESS.
   (A)   Permit application review timeframes.
      (1)   Collocation of small cell facilities on existing wireless support
structures. The village shall grant or deny its consent for requests to
collocate, or to replace or modify a small cell facility on, or associated
with, an existing wireless support structure not later than 60 days after the
date of filing by an entity of a completed application.
      (2)   New wireless support structures and associated small cell
facilities. The village shall grant or deny its consent for requests to
construct, modify, or replace a wireless support structure associated with a
small cell facility within the right-of-way not later than 90 days after the

      (3)   Wireless support structure and/or small cell facilities removal.
The village shall grant or deny its consent for requests to remove wireless
support structures associated with small cell facilities from the right-of-way
typical to the review timeframes for the general right-of-way permit required
for this activity.
      (4)   Eligible facilities request. The village shall approve eligible
facilities requests in accordance with Ohio Revised Code Chapter 4939, 47
C.F.R. 1.40001, and this chapter not later than 60 days after the date of
filing by an entity of a submitted application.
   (B)   Failure to grant or deny within prescribed timeframes. If the village
fails to approve or deny a request for consent under this section or a request
for a relevant work permit within the timeframes required under application
review timeframes and process §
96.03(A) above, provided the time period is not tolled under application review
timeframes and process §
96.03(D) below, or extended with the written consent of the applicant and the
Mayor, the request shall be deemed granted upon the requesting entity providing
notice to the village that the time period for acting on the request has
lapsed.
   (C)   Application denials.
      (1)   The village shall not unreasonably withhold or deny consent for
small cell facilities and wireless support structures within the right-of-way.
      (2)   If a request for consent is denied, the village shall provide in
writing its reasons for denying the request, supported by substantial,
competent evidence, and such information as the applicant may reasonably
request to obtain consent. The denial of consent shall not unreasonably
discriminate against the entity requesting the consent.
      (3)   Except in the case of a public utility subject to the jurisdiction
and recognized on the rolls of the public utilities commission or of a cable
operator possessing a valid franchise awarded pursuant to the "Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984," 98 Stat. 2779, 47 U.S.C.A. 541, the
village, for good cause shown, may withhold, deny, or delay its consent to any
person based upon the person's failure to possess the financial, technical, and
managerial resources necessary to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
   (D)   Tolling of required timeframes.
      (1)   The time periods required in application review timeframes and
process §
96.03(A) above may be tolled only:
         (a)   By mutual agreement between the entity requesting consent and
the village;
         (b)   In cases where the village determines that the application is
incomplete; or
         (c)   If the number of requests for consent for small cell facilities
or wireless support structures received is likely to result in difficulty
processing applications within the time limits set forth in application review
timeframes and process §
96.03(A) due to the lack of resources of the village, then the village may toll
the time limits as follows:
            1.   The time period may be tolled for up to 21 days for the first
15 small cell facility or wireless support structure requests received by the
village once more than 15 applications are received by the village within any
consecutive 30 day period.
            2.   Further, for every additional 15 requests that the village
receives above the thresholds provided above, the village may toll the time
period for those requests for up to 15 days in addition to the time period
provided in division (D)(1)(c)1. of this section.
            3.   In no instance shall the village toll the time period for any
small cell facility or wireless support structure request by more than 90
consecutive days. Upon request, the village shall provide an operator written
notice of the time limit for a small cell facility or wireless support
structure request.
            4.   The tolling provisions herein are set forth due to the
corresponding number of applications causing legitimate overload of the
village's resources to review applications.
      (2)   To toll the time period for incompleteness, the village shall
provide written notice to the person requesting consent to collocate a small-
cell facility not later than ten days after receiving the request, clearly and
specifically delineating all missing documents or information. To toll the time
period for incompleteness in an application to site a new wireless support
structure, the village shall provide written notice of incompleteness, clearly
and specifically delineating all missing documents or information, not later
than 30 days of receiving the request. The missing documents or information
shall be reasonably related to determining whether the request meets the
requirements of applicable federal and state law. Any notice of incompleteness
requiring other information or documentation, including information of the type
described in § 4939.0313 of the Ohio Revised Code or documentation intended to
illustrate the need for the request or to justify the business decision for the
request, in accordance with state and federal law, does not toll the time
period for incompleteness.
      (3)   For applications to construct a new wireless support structure, the
time period for granting or denying consent resumes when the entity makes a
supplemental submission in response to the village's notice of incompleteness.
For applications to collocate a small-cell facility, the time period for
granting or denying consent restarts when the entity makes a supplemental
submission in response to the village's notice of incompleteness.
      (4)   If a supplemental submission is inadequate, the village shall
notify the entity not later than ten days after receiving the supplemental
submission that the supplemental submission did not provide the information
identified in the original notice that delineated missing documents or
information. The time period may be tolled in the case of second or subsequent
notices under the procedures identified in divisions (1) to (3) of this
section. Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing
documents or information that was not delineated in the original notice of
incompleteness.
   (E)   Consolidated application for multiple small cell facilities and/or
wireless support structures.
      (1)   Applicants seeking to construct, modify, collocate, or replace more
than one small cell facility or more than one wireless support structure may
file, at the applicant's discretion, a consolidated application for up to 30
small cell facility requests or up to 30 wireless support structure requests in
a single application and receive a single permit for the construction,
modification, collocation, or replacement of the small cell facilities or
wireless support structures subject to the following:
         (a)   This single application may be filed for multiple small cell
facilities or multiple wireless support structures only if they are of
substantially the same type.
         (b)   The village may separately address small cell facility
collocations or wireless support structures for which incomplete information
has been received or which are denied.
      (2)   In the case of a consolidated application, the fees provided for in
§ 4939.0316 of the Ohio Revised Code and village fee requirement may be
cumulative. However, the village, at its discretion may opt to reduce such fees
in order to encourage consolidated application submittals.
      (3)   In the case of a consolidated application, each small cell facility
or wireless support structure proposed to be constructed, modified, collocated
on, or replaced shall constitute a separate request for consent for purposes of
tolling the response deadline as authorized under § 4939.036 of the Ohio
Revised Code and tolling of required timeframes (§
96.03(D)) herein. A request by a single operator for a new or replacement
wireless support structure and associated small cell facility constitutes one
request.
   (F)   Timeframe for completion of work authorized by permit.
      (1)   Collocations of small cell facilities on existing wireless support
structures and the construction of new wireless support structures and/or
associated small cell facilities for which permits have been granted shall be
completed by the operator or its agent within 180 days after issuance of the
permit, unless:
         (a)   The village and the operator agree to extend this period; or
         (b)   A delay is caused by make-ready work for a village-owned
wireless support structure or decorative pole or by the lack of commercial
power or backhaul availability at the site, provided that:
            1.   The operator has made a timely request within 60 days after
the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services; and
            2.   The additional time to complete installation does not exceed
360 days after issuance of the permit.
      (2)   If divisions (1)(a) and (b) of this section cannot be met, the
permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in writing to the
operator.
   (G)   Small cell facility and wireless support structure activities not
requiring consent.
      (1)   Village consent shall not be required for either of the following
activities conducted in the right-of-way:
         (a)   Routine maintenance of wireless facilities;
         (b)   The replacement of wireless facilities with wireless facilities
that are consistent with the village's current design requirements and
guidelines and that are either:
            1.   Substantially similar to the existing wireless facilities; or
            2.   The same size or smaller than the existing wireless
facilities.
(Ord. O-2591-19, passed 2-18-19)

§ 96.08 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of the above sections of this chapter are severable. If any
provision or subsection, or the application of any provision or subsection to
any person or circumstances is held invalid, the remaining provisions,

CONDITIONS OF SYSTEM
§ 110.010 SIGNAL TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION METHODS.
   The transmission and distribution of electronic signals may be made at the
option of the operator as follows, and in addition to being as authorized by
the FCC shall, if applicable, be in accordance with rules, regulations and
tariffs of the Ohio Public Utilities Commission:
   (A)   Through coaxial or fiber-optic cable and/or other electrical

apparatus used or designed for use in any cable television system shall be
erected or installed above the surface of the ground, except as herein
specifically permitted.
      (1)   Notwithstanding the authorization for the use by the operator of
electric or telephone utility poles, the operator shall discontinue the use of
the poles at such time as they are no longer being used by both the electric
and telephone company, it being the intent hereof that if the utility companies

their overhead lines, the operator shall provide underground conduits or make
other arrangement for such portions of its lines, in order that the poles and
attached conductors may be removed.
      (2)   The operator shall grant to the Village, free of expense, joint use
of all its owned underground conduit for any proper municipal purposes, insofar
as it may be done without interfering with the operator's own use thereof and

operator, the Village shall hold the operator harmless from any and all
actions, causes of action, or damages caused by the Village's use thereof.
      (4)   Any construction and utilization by the Village, as regards conduit
of the operator, shall conform to the same requirements set forth for the
operator in the general areas of safety, quality, maintenance and RF (radio
frequency) interference.
      (5)   Subject to applicable provisions of federal law or applicable
Village ordinances, the right of construction, including easements, is not
implied, except in locations where the Village has the authority to grant such
rights and easements. In such locations, the Mayor may authorize such
construction if it will not materially conflict with other public uses thereof.
All other rights of construction, including easements, shall be the
responsibility of the operator.
      (6)   No construction either on poles or of underground conduit shall
begin without prior written approval of the Mayor.
      (7)   All trimming of trees necessitated by the operator's installations,
whether on public or private property, shall be accomplished by personnel
trained in such work.

(other than an easement obtained by the operator directly from the property
owner), the operator shall give written notice to the owner of such property as
to the proposed construction and/or installations to be made in such area. Such
notice shall be given at least seven days before commencement of any
construction or installation, and shall contain reference to any improvement on
such property which may be damaged or displaced. The operator shall replace or
restore any such improvement or any shrubbery, trees, sod or other thing unless
otherwise agreed to by the property owner.
   (B)   Through the common carrier facilities, including coaxial cable and/or
other electrical conductors and/or radio wave transmission, owned by any other
provider of telephony services.
   (C)   Through the common carrier facilities of any provider of telephony
services for main and lateral cable service, with the operator installing and
maintaining its own service, through coaxial cable and/or other electrical
conductors, between terminating units of any other provider of telephony
services and the dwellings and business establishments of subscribers.
   (D)   Through the air by means of radio wave transmission facilities of the
operator, either totally or in part in combination with (A), (B) and (C) of
this section.

interfere with the travel and use of public places; and during construction,
repair and removal thereof, shall not obstruct or impede traffic or
unnecessarily interfere with the use or enjoyment of public or private property
adjacent thereto. The operator shall obtain advance written approval by the

by the operator, the operator shall remove all of its equipment and
installations over and under village streets, at the request of Council; over
and under private property at the request of the property owners; and from the
homes or business establishments of subscribers, at their request. The operator
may also, upon approval of the Mayor, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, abandon equipment and facilities located underground. All equipment
and installations to be removed pursuant to this section shall be removed in a
reasonable time.
(Ord. 0-1621-97, § 709.03, passed 7-21-97)
§ 110.043 BONDS.
   (A)   The operator shall post bond in the sum of $20,000 guaranteeing the
removal of all its equipment and installations, if its operation ceases,
whatever the cause or reason, if requested to do so by the Council, individual
private property owners or subscribers.
   (B)   The bonding as called for in division (A) of this section shall be
subject to these requirements:
      (1)   Such bond shall be executed by the operator and one or more
sureties reasonably approved by the Village Solicitor.
      (2)   Either the bond (or bonds) or certified copies must be on file with
the Mayor.
      (3)   The bond (or bonds) must provide by enforcement that it cannot be
cancelled or amended by the bonding company prior to ten days notice to the
Mayor.
      (4)   The bond (or bonds) must be effective before the operator commences

   (C)   Within 30 days from the effective date of the granting of a permit by
ordinance, the operator shall furnish a bond to the Village in the amount of
$25,000 guaranteeing the faithful performance of the obligations of the
operator under the terms of this ordinance, the bond being in addition to that
required under division (A) of this section, and subject to these requirements:
      (1)   The bond shall be executed by the operator and one or more sureties
reasonably approved by the Village Solicitor.
      (2)   Either the bond (or bonds) or certified copies must be on file with
the Mayor.
      (3)   The bond (or bonds) must provide by endorsement that it cannot be
cancelled or amended by the bonding company prior to ten days notice to the
Mayor.
   (D)   It is not the intention of the Council to require either unnecessary
or excessive bonding, or double bonding, nor unnecessary or excessive
insurance, or double insurance; therefore the Council may waive the
requirements for bonds and insurance, excluding the performance bond called for
by division (C) above, or reduce the amounts thereof, for good cause shown. An
additional consideration for reduction or waiver will be the extent of radio
wave transmission versus the use of cable and/or other electrical conductors.

   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (B)(2) of this section,
if the period of limitation provided in division (A)(1) or (A)(3) of this

the offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved person's legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (A)(1) or (A)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of R.C. § 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a

         (b)   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this division:
         OFFENSE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE OF A PUBLIC
SERVANT. The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of R.C. §
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A) or
(B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense involving
misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any municipal
ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code sections listed
in this division (C)(2).
         PUBLIC SERVANT. Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (D)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 of the Revised
Code is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable
person and if the time of the determination is within 25 years after the
offense is committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section
may be commenced within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed
or five years after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, DNA RECORD has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.57.
   (E)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (F)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (G)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (H)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this
Village or conceals the accused's identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused's purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (I)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this state, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (J)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Title or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (K)   As used in this section, PEACE OFFICER has the same meaning as in R.C.
§ 2935.01.
   (L)   The amendments to divisions (A) and (D) of this section apply to a
violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015,
and apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July
16, 2015, if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section
as it existed on July 15, 2015.
(R.C. § 2901.13) (Ord. 886, § 1103.05, passed 3-18-74)
§ 130.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (B) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (B)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (C)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (C)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (D)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (E)   As used in this section:
   CULPABILITY. Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as defined in
R.C. § 2901.22.
   INTOXICATION. Includes but is not limited to intoxication resulting from the
ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
   INVOLUNTARY ACTS. Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
   POSSESSION. A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured or received
the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the thing
possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(R.C. § 2901.21) (Ord. 886, § 1103.06, passed 3-18-74)
§ 130.08 CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (A)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (B)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (C)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (D)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (E)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22) (Ord. 886, § 1103.07, passed 3-18-74)
§ 130.09 ORGANIZATIONAL LIABILITY.
   (A)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or
employment.
   (B)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (C)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (D)   As used in this section, ORGANIZATION means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity. ORGANIZATION does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(R.C. § 2901.23) (Ord. 886, § 1103.08, passed 3-18-74)
§ 130.10 PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (A)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in R.C.
§ 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if
he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the
offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (B)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(R.C. § 2901.24) (Ord. 886, § 1103.09, passed 3-18-74)
§ 130.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Considerations in misdemeanor sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (A)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (A)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (A)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (A)(1) and (A)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (A)(1) through (A)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(R.C. §2929.21) (Ord. 886, §1103.10, passed 3-18-74)
   (B)   Misdemeanor jail terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in R.C. §§ 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (B)(5)
or (B)(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized
pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender
for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   (a)   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (B) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (D)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         (b)   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (B)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has
established a county jail industry program pursuant to R.C. § 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender’s term in the
county jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (B) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to R.C. §
2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which
the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to R.C. §§
307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or
2947.19 and R.C. § 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         (a)   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
R.C. § 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is required
to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(B)(4)(a)1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
R.C. § 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         (b)   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (C)(4)(a)2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, also
is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type described
in R.C. § 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the offender for
the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender an additional
definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional jail term shall
not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Revised Code. The offender
shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and prior to the jail
term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to any other
mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   (a)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (B)(6)(a)2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of R.C. § 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1421 regarding one or more
of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         (b)   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (B)(6)(a) of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (B)(6)(a) of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of R.C. § 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (D) of this
section or R.C. § 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (C) or
this section or R.C. § 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(B), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (D) or (E) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(R.C. § 2929.24)
   (C)   Misdemeanor community control sanctions.
      (1)   (a)   Except as provided in R.C. §§ 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a
jail term is required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor,
other than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the
following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (D), (E), or (F) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (B) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (D), (E), or (F) of this section.
         (b)   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         (c)   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (C)
(1)(a)1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender’s community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (C)(1)(b) of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (D), (E), or (F) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (B) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (C)(1)(a)1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   (a)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (D), (E), or (F) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         (b)   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender’s probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender’s good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender’s compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   (a)   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (D), (E), or (F) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         (b)   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (C)(1)(b) of this
section:
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction:
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         (c)   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (C)(4)(b) of this section.
         (d)   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (C)(4)(b) of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (C)(4)(b) of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (D), (E), or (F) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (F) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.25)
   (D)   Community residential sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (D). Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         (b)   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (D)
(1)(b) of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (D) may do either or both of the following:
         (a)   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         (b)   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for
the duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and
for travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (D)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (F) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (D)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (D)(1)(a) of this section.
(R.C. § 2929.26)
   (E)   Nonresidential sanction where jail term is not mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division. Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   A term of day reporting;
         (b)   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous
alcohol monitoring or both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring, a term of electronic monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring
without house arrest, or a term of house arrest without electronic monitoring
or continuous alcohol monitoring;
         (c)   A term of community service of up to 500 hours for misdemeanor
of the first degree or 200 hours for a misdemeanor of the second, third, or
fourth degree;
         (d)   A term in a drug treatment program with a level of security for
the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         (e)   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         (f)   A term of basic probation supervision;
         (g)   A term of monitored time;
         (h)   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         (i)   A curfew term;
         (j)   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         (k)   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         (l)   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         (m)   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender’s privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender’s motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator’s license, or any other related sanction;
         (n)   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of R.C. § 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of R.C. § 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (E)(1)(c) of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (E)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
(R.C. § 2929.27)
   (F)   Financial sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to R.C. § 2947.23, the
court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this division (F). If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
         (a)   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on
restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of
restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender. No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         (b)   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (F)(1)(b)1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than
$1,000;
               B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $750;
               C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $500;
               D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $250;
               E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $150.
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in R.C. § 2949.111.
         (c)   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               A.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under R.C. § 2951.021;
               B.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               C.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under R.C. § 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (F)(1)(c)1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
R.C. § 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in R.C. § 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   (a)   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (F) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         (b)   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (E)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (E)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (F) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (E)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   (a)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (F)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (D), (E),
or (F) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (D) of this section to the county
treasurer. The county treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county’s general fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (D), (E), or (F) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (D) of this
section.
         (b)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (F)(1)(c) of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (D), (E),
or (F) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (D) of this section to the
treasurer of the municipal corporation. The treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation’s general fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (D), (E), or (F) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (D) of this
section.
         (c)   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (F)(1)(c) of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (D), (E), or (F) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (G), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
$70 nor more than $500, which shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to
be credited to the address confidentiality program fund created by R.C. §
111.48.
      (5)   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this division (F)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (F)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (F)(1)(c)1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (F)(1)(c)1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (F)(1)(a) of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (F)(5)(b)1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (F)(5)(b)2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (F)(5)(b)3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         (b)   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order
under this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political
subdivision may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in R.C. §
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under R.C. § 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (F)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (F) may designate the clerk of the court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         (a)   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (F), a court shall
comply with R.C. §§ 307.86 to 307.92.
         (b)   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the board of county commissioners of the county pursuant to R.C. §
301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the clerk
may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of public
money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         (c)   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (F) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(R.C. § 2929.28)
   (G)   Organizational penalties.
      (1)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in this section, an
organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
         (a)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than $5,000;
         (b)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than $4,000;
         (c)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than $3,000;
         (d)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than $2,000;
         (e)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than $1,000;
         (f)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
$2,000;
         (g)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more
than $1,000.
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
      (3)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
      (4)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to §
130.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.

this section, no person giving aid to a sick or injured person shall

   (C)   No person who discovers the body or acquires the first knowledge of
the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is
obtained. For purposes of this division, “advanced practice registered nurse”
does not include a certified registered nurse anesthetist.
   (D)   No person shall fail to provide upon request of the person to whom a
report required by division (C) of this section was made, or to any law
enforcement officer who has reasonable cause to assert the authority to
investigate the circumstances surrounding the death, any facts within his or

      (2)   No physician, nurse, physician assistant, or limited practitioner
who, outside a hospital, sanitarium, or other medical facility, attends or

this section or anyone participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from
the reports is immune from any civil or criminal liability that otherwise might
be incurred or imposed as a result of such actions. Notwithstanding R.C. §
4731.22, the physician- patient relationship or advanced practice registered
nurse-patient relationship is not a ground for excluding evidence regarding a
person’s burn injury or the cause of the burn injury in any judicial proceeding
resulting from a report submitted under division (E) of this section.

§ 3113.31, shall note that knowledge or belief and the basis for it in the
patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding R.C. § 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege or
advanced practice registered nurse-patient privilege shall not be a ground for
excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under division (F)(1) of this section, and the information may be

relay service call.
      (2)   The information would tend to incriminate a member of the actor's
immediate family.
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under R.C. § 2739.04 or 2739.12.

member of the ordained clergy of an organized religious body of a confidential

seeking his or her aid or counsel.
      (5)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the

of treatment or services for drug dependent persons or persons in danger of
drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a hospital,
clinic, person, agency, or community addiction services provider whose alcohol
and drug addiction services are certified pursuant to R.C. § 5119.36.
      (6)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of his or her duties in connection with a bona fide program
for providing counseling services to victims of crimes that are violations of
R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.05, or to victims of felonious sexual penetration in
violation of former R.C. § 2907.12. As used in this division, COUNSELING
SERVICES include services provided in an informal setting by a person who, by
education or experience, is competent to provide such services.
   (H)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to
any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.
   (I)   Whoever violates division (A) or (B) of this section is guilty of
failure to report a crime. Violation of division (A)(1) of this section is a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Violation of division (A)(2) or (B) of this
section is a misdemeanor of the second degree.

failure to report knowledge of a death, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

regardless of whether the person or child aided ultimately is apprehended for,
is charged with, is convicted of, pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated a

or a mentally or physically disabled child under 21 years of age, shall create
a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a duty of
care, protection, or support. It is not a violation of a duty of care,

§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village
Council does ordain this chapter as follows.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the Village are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (G)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)
§ 152.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and,
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)

however, include:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure"; or
      (3)   Any improvement to a structure which is considered new
construction.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the standards of this ordinance consistent
with the variance conditions herein.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)
§ 152.06 LANDS TO WHICH PROVISIONS APPLY.
   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the Village as identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, including any additional flood hazard areas annexed by the Village that
are not identified on the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)
§ 152.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   The areas of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled
Flood Insurance Study for Franklin County, Ohio, and Incorporated Areas. This
study dated March 16, 2004, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and
any revisions thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part
of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study is on file at the Village of Marble
Cliff Municipal Building and at the office of the Village Engineer.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)
§ 152.08 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected, constructed,
repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full compliance with
the terms of this chapter and all other applicable regulations which apply to
uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter, unless specifically exempted from
filing for a development permit as stated in §
152.40, Exemption from Filing a Development Permit.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)
§ 152.09 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing
easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)
§ 152.10 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be:
   (A)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (B)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (C)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of this chapter may be in conflict with a
state law, such state law shall take precedence over the ordinance.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)
§ 152.11 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the Village, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)

§ 152.27 AREAS WITHIN FLOODWAYS.
   The Flood Insurance Study referenced in §
152.07 identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as a
floodway. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in §
152.41(B). The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential.
The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
   (A)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practices demonstrates that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of §
152.26, Specific Standards.
   (C)   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an increase
in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by the
Village Engineer to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and must meet the
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.

ADMINISTRATION
§ 152.40 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT; EXEMPTION.
   (A)   Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be
obtained from the Village Engineer before construction or development begins
within any area of special flood hazard established in §
152.07, Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. Application
for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the Village
Engineer and may include, but not be limited to: site specific topographic
plans drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations
of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of
materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. The
following information is required:
      (1)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor,
including basement, of all proposed structures located in special flood hazard
areas where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (2)   Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any proposed
structure will be floodproofed in accordance with §
152.26(B)(1) where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (3)   Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in §
152.26(B)(1) where base flood elevation data are utilized;
      (4)   Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of the proposed development and certification by a
registered professional engineer that the flood carrying capacity of the
watercourse will not be diminished.
      (5)   Certification by a registered professional engineer, architect, or
surveyor of the structure’s as-built lowest floor or flood proofed elevation.
   (B)   Exemption from filing a development permit. An application for a
development permit shall not be required for maintenance work such as roofing,
painting, and basement sealing, or for small nonstructural development
activities (except for filling and grading) valued at less than $1,000. Any
proposed action exempt from filing for a development permit is also exempt from
the standards of this chapter.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)
§ 152.41 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF VILLAGE ENGINEER.
   The Village Engineer is hereby appointed to administer and implement this
chapter by granting or denying development permit applications in accordance
with its provisions. The duties and responsibilities of the Village Engineer
shall include but are not limited to:
   (A)   Permit review.
      (1)   Review all development permits to determine that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
      (2)   Review all development permits to assure that all necessary permits
have been received from those federal, state or local governmental agencies
from which prior approval is required. The applicant shall be responsible for
obtaining such permits as required including permits issued by the Department
of the Army under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 USC 1 et seq.
and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 USC 1344.
      (3)   Review all development permits to determine if the proposed
development is located within a designated floodway. Floodways are delineated
in the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map or the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the
Flood Insurance Study. Floodways may also be delineated in other sources of
flood information. If the proposed development is located within a designated
floodway, assure that the encroachment provision of §
152.27(A) is met.
      (4)   Inspect all development projects before, during, and after
construction to ensure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure
compliance with all provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Use of other base flood elevation and floodway data. Areas of special
flood hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency in accordance with §
152.07 Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard, are designated
as Zone A on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map. Within these areas, the
Village Engineer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source,
including data obtained under §
152.26(F), Subdivisions and Large Developments, in order to administer §
152.26(A), Specific Standards, Residential Construction; §
152.26(B), Specific Standards, Nonresidential Construction; and §
152.27, Areas Within Floodways.
   (C)   Information to be obtained and maintained. Where base flood elevation
data are utilized within area of special flood hazard on a community's Flood
Insurance Rate Map, regardless of the source of such data, the following
provisions apply:
      (1)   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor, including basement, of all new or substantially
improved structures, and record whether or not such structures contain an
enclosure below the lowest floor;
      (2)   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential
structures:
         (a)   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and,
         (b)   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in §
152.40(A)(3).
      (3)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Alteration of watercourses.
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities and the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Division of Water, prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. A watercourse is considered to be altered if any change
occurs within its banks.
      (2)   Maintain engineering documentation required in §
152.40(A)(4) that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse will not be diminished.
      (3)   Require that necessary maintenance will be provided for the altered
or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity
will not be diminished.
   (E)   Interpretation of flood boundaries. Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special
flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a
mapped boundary and actual field conditions). Where a map boundary and field
elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in the flood elevation profile
shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
152.42, Variance Procedure.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)
§ 152.42 VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Appeal Board.
      (1)   The Village Council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter.
      (2)   The Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there
is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Village
Engineer in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
      (3)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Council or any taxpayer, may
appeal such decision to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, as provided
in R.C. Chapter 2506.
      (4)   In passing upon such applications, the Council shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (e)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         (f)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors of division (4) above of this
section and the purposes of this chapter, the Council may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this chapter.
      (6)   The Village Engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
upon request.
   (B)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (3)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items (a) through (k) in division (A)(4)
above have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (4)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and,
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
division (A)(4) above, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. O-1999-04, passed 3-15-04)
§ 152.99 PENALTY.
   Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of
its requirements shall constitute a misdemeanor of the third degree. Any person
who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements
(including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection
with conditions) shall upon conviction thereof be fined or imprisoned as
provided by the laws of the Village. Each day such violation continues shall be
considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
Village from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or
remedy any violation. The Village shall prosecute any violation of this chapter
in accordance with the penalties stated herein.

STANDARDS OF DESIGN
§ 153.30 RELATION TO EXISTING STREET SYSTEM.
   (A)   New subdivision streets shall conform to the principal existing
streets in the adjacent area (or center line projection made when adjoining
land is not subdivided), when deemed necessary by the Council, together with
the continuation of all existing utility mains in adjoining areas. Off-set
streets should be avoided.

Penalty, see § 153.99
§ 153.31 STREETS IN RELATION TO MAIN THOROUGHFARES.
   When a proposed subdivision adjoins or contains, for a considerable
distance, a main thoroughfare, expressway or railroad, a street should be
dedicated approximately parallel to the side of such right-of-way. In
determining the distance of such parallel street from the right-of-way of the
main thoroughfare, expressway or railroad, consideration should be given to the
distance required for approach grades and interchanges to future grade
separations.

§ 153.32 STREET WIDTHS.
   (A)   The widths for major streets shall conform to the widths of existing
major streets.
   (B)   The minimum dedicated width for minor streets shall be 50 feet.
   (C)   Where it is desirable to subdivide a tract of land which, because of
its size or location, does not permit a layout directly related to a normal
street arrangement, there may be established one or more "places". Such "place"
may be in the form of a court, a cul-de-sac or other arrangement, provided that
proper access shall be given to all lots from same. A cul-de-sac shall
terminate in an open circular space having a minimum radius of 50 feet. Except
in unusual cases, no such cul-de-sac shall exceed 600 feet in length. Four
hundred feet shall be considered the normal or average length.
   (D)   Utility easements of not less than five feet in width shall be
provided on each side of all rear lot lines to provide access for the
installation and maintenance of all utility lines, overhead or underground.
Wider easements may be required along or across lots for main storm or sanitary
sewers or other utilities, or where a combination of main lines is indicated.
   (E)   Off-street parking provisions shall be made in all subdivisions. The
subdivider of commercial property shall provide twice as much area for parking
as is to be devoted to the total floor area of each commercial building, as
required in the zoning ordinance. Parking shall also be provided in all other
areas as required in the zoning ordinance.

   (A)   No residential block shall be longer than 900 feet between street
lines, except all blocks fronting on main and secondary thoroughfares shall be
not less than 1500 feet between street lines unless existing conditions dictate
otherwise. Residential blocks in self contained neighborhood units shall be no
longer than 1500 feet between street lines.
   (B)   The Council may require a public crosswalk near the center of blocks
which are over 900 feet in length. The right-of-way of such crosswalks shall be
not less than ten feet in width.
   (C)   In plotting normal residential lots, the area of which shall be from
10,000 to 20,000 square feet, the recommended depth of blocks should not exceed
300 feet.

§ 153.34 LOTS.
   (A)   All side lot lines shall be at right angles or as near 90 degrees as
possible to straight street lines, or radial to curved street lines, unless a
variation of this rule will give a better street and lot plan. Lots with double
frontage shall be avoided.

or land, or upon the height of buildings, or requires larger open spaces or
greater lot area per family, than are required by or imposed by such easements,
covenants or agreements between parties, or by such ordinances, rules,
regulations, or permits, the provisions of this chapter shall control.
(Ord. 0-1847-01, passed 12-17-01)
§ 154.005 AMENDMENT TO ZONING PROVISIONS.
   Whenever the public necessity, convenience, general welfare or good zoning

(Ord. 0-1847-01, passed 12-17-01)
§ 154.006 PROCEDURE FOR CHANGE IN ZONING DISTRICT; APPLICATION FEES.
   (A)   Procedure.
      (1)   Procedure for change in zoning districts. Applications for any
change of district boundaries or classifications of property as shown on the
zoning map shall be submitted to the Village Council, at its public office upon
required forms, and be accompanied by data and information as may be prescribed
for that purpose by the Village Council, so as to assure the fullest
practicable presentation of facts for the permanent record. Each such
application shall be verified by at least one of the owners or lessees of
property within the area proposed to be reclassified, attesting to the truth
and correctness of all facts and information presented with the applications.
Applications for amendments initiated by the Village Council shall be
accompanied by its motion pertaining to such proposed amendment.
      (2)   Names and addresses of adjacent property owners. Any person or
persons desiring a change in the zoning classification of property shall file,
with the application for such change, a statement giving the names and
addresses of the owners of all properties lying (a) within 100 feet of; (b)
contiguous to; (c) directly across the street or alley from any part of the
property the zoning classification of which is proposed to be changed.
      (3)   Public hearing by Village Council. The Village Council shall hold
at least one public hearing thereon, notice of which shall be in accordance
with the notice standards in the Ohio Revised Code.
      (4)   Notice to property owners. In addition to the published notice as
hereinbefore specified, the Village Council shall give notice of time, place
and purpose of public hearings to be held by it on proposed amendments or
supplements, to owners of all properties lying (a) within 100 feet of; (b)
contiguous to; (c) directly across the street or alley from any part of the
property the zoning classification of which is proposed to be changed. The
failure to notify, as provided in this section, shall not invalidate any
recommendations adopted hereunder; it being the intention of this section to
provide, so far as may be possible, due notice to the persons substantially
interested in the proposed change that an application is pending before the
Council, proposing to make a change in the zoning district map or the
regulations set forth in this chapter.
   (B)   Application fees. At the time that an application for a change of
zoning districts is filed with the Village Council, as provided herein, the
applicant shall deposit with the Clerk-Treasurer a fee to cover investigation,
legal notices and other expenses incidental to the determination of such
matter, such fee to be for one lot or part of one lot. The applicant shall
deposit with the Clerk-Treasurer an additional fee for each additional lot or
part of an additional lot which may be included in the request, such additional
lot or part of a lot to be adjacent to each other. Such sums so deposited shall
be credited by the Clerk-Treasurer to the general fund. The amount of these
fees, as determined by Council, are available and posted in a fee schedule
available through the Village Clerk.

      (1)   Any lawful uses of buildings or land existing at the effective date
of this chapter may be continued, even though such use does not conform to the
provisions of this chapter. The nonconforming use of a building may be extended
throughout those existing parts of the building which were arranged or designed
for such use. No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved, extended,
enlarged or altered and no nonconforming use of land shall be expanded, except
when authorized by the Village Council.
      (2)   Whenever the use of a building or land becomes nonconforming
through a change in the amended zoning chapter or in the district boundaries,
such use may be continued.
      (3)   A nonconforming use which is discontinued shall not again be used
except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is
located.
      (4)   Any building arranged, intended or designed for a nonconforming use
the construction of which has been started at the time of the passage of this
chapter, but not completed, may be completed and put into such non-conforming
use, provided it is done within one year after this chapter takes effect.
      (5)   Zoning certificate. A zoning certificate shall be required for all
lawful nonconforming uses of land and building created by adoption of this
chapter.
      (6)   A nonconforming use which has been damaged by fire, explosion, act
of God or the public enemy to the extent of 51% or more of its reproduction
value at the time of damage shall not be restored except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located. When damaged by less than
51% of its reproduction value, a non-conforming use may be repaired or
reconstructed, and used as before the time of damage, provided such repairs or
reconstruction are started within one year of the date of such damage.

   The regulations set forth by this chapter within each district shall be
minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of
structure or land except as hereinafter provided:

no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered unless in conformity
with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is
located.
   (B)   No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered
in the following manner or in any other manner contrary to the provisions of
this chapter:
      (1)   To exceed the height requirements set forth herein;
      (2)   To accommodate or house a greater number of families;

other open spaces;
   (C)   No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this chapter shall

provided in the state building code and as set forth herein:
      (1)   An application for a permit shall be obtained from the village or
its authorized representative and submitted in such form as the village may

§ 154.062 DEMOLITION PERMIT.
   (A)   Background. The village is fully developed with little vacant land and
covers a compact geographic area. Residential property values have been
maintained in significant part due to the village's unique physical attributes
such as high quality homes built primarily between 1895 and 1950, and plentiful
mature trees and landscaping on both public and private property. The
demolition of existing buildings which frequently also results in the
destruction and removal of mature trees and significant landscaping features
may constitute an irreparable loss to the quality and character of the village,
and the health, safety, comfort and general welfare of its residents.
   (B)   Demolition or removal of existing structures.  No primary building or
structure, or significant accessory structure such as a carriage house
(hereinafter collectively referred to as "buildings") shall be demolished,
partially demolished or removed (hereinafter collectively referred to as
"demolition" or "demolished") until an application for a demolition permit has
been submitted in a form acceptable to the village, and approved by Village
Council, except when demolition is determined by the Village Engineer or the
Building Official to be required to abate a nuisance or eliminate an unsafe
building as defined in
Chapter 151 of this code or the applicable Building Code; or, in the case of a
partial demolition, the permit is approved by the Mayor or the Mayor's designee
based upon the criteria set forth herein.
   (C)   Contents of demolition permit application. A demolition permit
application shall include the following in addition to a completed wrecking or
demolition permit form and any other information the village may reasonably
request:
      (1)   A statement and explanation as to whether or not such building is,
historically, architecturally, culturally or otherwise worthy of preservation,
together with supporting information;
      (2)   The reasons for the proposed demolition;
      (3)   A site plan detailing the proposed reuse of the site, a complete
restoration and landscape plan, including a plan for the preservation (and
replacement in the case of damage or destruction) of existing trees and other
significant landscape features, together with any reasons for not building a
replacement structure;
      (4)   When a replacement building is proposed, an accurate and detailed
rendering of the proposed replacement structure, and a detailed time schedule
for the replacement project; and
      (5)   An assessment of the effect of the demolition and proposed
replacement project (if applicable) on the subject property and the surrounding
area.
   (D)   Council action.  Village Council shall approve a demolition permit if
it finds that two of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   The building is not historically, architecturally or culturally
significant or otherwise worthy of preservation;
      (2)    There exists no reasonable economic use for the building as it
exists or as it might be restored and that there exists no feasible or prudent
alternative to demolition;
      (3)   That deterioration has progressed to a point where it is not
economically feasible to restore the building; or
   (E)   Council review criteria.  
      (1)   The following criteria may be used by Village Council in
determining whether a building is historically, architecturally or culturally
significant or otherwise worthy of preservation:
         (a)   The age and condition of the building;
         (b)   The quality of the building's architectural design, detail, use
of materials or construction;
         (c)   The importance of the building to the character and quality of
the neighborhood;
         (d)   The identification of the building as the work of an architect,
artisan, engineer, landscape architect, builder or developer whose work is
significant to the village, central Ohio, the state or nation;
         (e)   The identification of the building with a public or private
figure who significantly contributed to the Village, central Ohio, the state or
nation;
         (f)   The significance of the design or style of the building to the
historical, architectural or cultural development of the village, central Ohio,
the state or nation; or
         (g)   The impact of restoration on the village's real property or
income tax base versus replacement and/or removal.
      (2)   The following criteria may be used by Village Council to determine
whether there exists no reasonable economic use for the building as it exists
or as it might be restored, and that there exists no feasible or prudent
alternative to demolition:
         (a)   The denial of a demolition permit will result in the
continuation of a substantial economic burden because the building cannot be
reasonably maintained in its current form; or
         (b)   The denial of a demolition permit will result in a substantial
economic burden because the cost of preserving or restoring the building will
impose an unreasonable financial burden.
      (3)   The following criteria may be used by Village Council in
determining whether deterioration of the building has progressed to a point
where restoration is not economically feasible:
         (a)   Preservation or restoration of the building is not structurally
feasible; or
         (b)   Deterioration has progressed to a point where restoration is not
practicable.
   (F)   Additional evidence. In addition to considering reports from the
Village Engineer or other such consultants as Village Council may direct,
Village Council may request that the applicant provide a report or reports
concerning the proposed demolition and/or the existing structure from a
registered architect, historical conservator, or other person with appropriate
preservation experience.
   (G)   Additional standards and guidelines.  Village Council may, from time
to time, adopt by resolution additional standards or guidelines.

(Ord. 0-1847-01, passed 12-17-01)
PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
§ 154.094 PURPOSE AND APPLICATION.
   (A)   Purpose. The Planned Development District (PDD) regulations are based
on the premise that the ultimate quality of a built environment or development
proposal is determined not only by the type, character and allocation of land
uses but also by the way in which such land uses are executed. In many cases,
the subdivision regulations and standard zoning district regulations and
procedures do not adequately regulate the design of buildings or enable the
range of uses in a single zoning district that are appropriate in the village.
      (1)   The purposes of the PDD regulations are to:
         (a)   Provide an opportunity for a mix of land uses otherwise not
permitted within the standard municipal zoning district classifications.
         (b)   Allow the creation of development standards that respect the
unique characteristics, natural quality and beauty of the site and the
immediate vicinity and protect the community's natural resources by avoiding
development on, and destruction of, sensitive environmental areas.
         (c)   Enable greater review of design characteristics to ensure that
the development project is properly integrated into its surroundings and is
compatible with adjacent development.
         (d)   Assure compatibility between proposed land uses within and
around the PDD through appropriate development controls.
         (e)   Pursue the housing and economic development goals of the
village.
         (f)   Promote economical and efficient use of land and reduce
infrastructure costs through unified development.
         (g)   Provide for supporting community facilities.
         (h)   Establish objective criteria for development plan review that
ensure conformity to community and district standards and allow for consistent
treatment throughout.
      (2)   The procedures established for PDDs are designed to encourage:
         (a)   Unified development projects that exhibit creative planning and
design in ways that cannot be achieved through a standard zoning district or
subdivision regulation, yet are consistent with any applicable plans, including
but not limited to, the infrastructure system, contiguous land uses, and the
intent of the Zoning Code and subdivision regulations.
         (b)   Imaginative architectural design.
         (c)   Flexibility in building styles and types.
         (d)   Proper relationships between buildings, between developments and
between structures and the land.
         (e)   The development of the land in an orderly, coordinated and
comprehensive manner consistent with accepted land planning, landscape
architecture practices and engineering principles according to approved
development plans.
   (B)   Application. The PDD regulations assist in accomplishing these
purposes by establishing review steps that combine the request for a zoning
with the development plan review process, and when applicable, the subdivision
process. Subsequent plan review following the zoning amendment also requires
simultaneous review of subdivision plats.
      (1)   Each PDD shall be considered a separate and unique zoning district
wherein a Preliminary Development Plan, including associated text depicting the
specific development standards, is adopted simultaneously with the amendment of
the zoning map to apply the PDD designation. The Preliminary Development Plan
shall apply only to the property within that particular PDD.
      (2)   PDDs adopted and established in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter and the requirements contained herein shall take precedence over
any conflicting regulations contained in the Zoning Code and Subdivision
Regulations.
   (C)   Ownership.  The PDD shall be an integrated, unified development
project wherein the entire project area shall be in joint ownership or control
at the time the application is made for the PDD designation so that all
property owners are applicants. Any transfer of land within the development
resulting in ownership within the development by two or more parties after an
application has been filed shall not alter the applicability of the regulations
contained herein. A Planned Residential Development approved in accordance with
previous regulations shall be binding upon the owners, their successors and
assigns and shall limit and control the issuance and validity of all zoning
certificates.
(Ord. O-2132-06, passed 1-22-06)
§ 154.095 ESTABLISHMENT OF PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.
   (A)   PDDs adopted after the effective date of these regulations. A PDD
shall be established according to the following:

be adopted at the time of rezoning.
      (4)   Detailed Final Development Plans shall be reviewed and acted upon
by Council according to §
154.096.
      (5)   A preliminary subdivision plat may be reviewed simultaneously with
a Preliminary Development Plan. A final subdivision plat shall be reviewed
simultaneously with a Final Development Plan, unless a final plat has already
been approved or is not required for completion of the project. All subdivision
plats shall be reviewed and approved by Council according to
Chapter 153, Subdivision Regulations, except as otherwise addressed in §§
154.094 through
154.099.
   (B)   General development criteria.  A PDD shall be designed and depicted on
the Preliminary Development Plan and Final Development Plan in accordance with
the following general development criteria:
      (1)   Plan design. The proposed PDD shall be designed in accordance with
accepted planning principles, including the planning and development principles
included in this section, to ensure that the use of land, buildings and other
structures; the building location, bulk, layout, arrangement, design, and
height; the percentages of lot areas that may be occupied; the setback of
buildings; the sizes of yards and other spaces; and the density of population
are in compliance with the purposes and objectives of the PDD regulations as
set forth in §
154.094(A).
      (2)   Permitted and conditional uses. A PDD may include any combination
of uses when such use(s) are found to be compatible with one another and in
keeping with the intent of these general development criteria, provided the
proposed location of the uses will not adversely affect adjacent property and/
or the public health, safety and general welfare.
         (a)   The list of specific uses to be included in the proposed PDD
shall be clearly delineated in the Preliminary Development Plan and its
supporting documentation.

            3.   Street alignments should be designed to conserve natural
features and minimize the need for cut and fill practices.
            4.   The function of adjacent thoroughfares shall be maintained by
limiting access points to the minimum needed, relating them to existing access
points, the street patterns on surrounding development and the intensity of
proposed uses.
            5.   Private streets as a common easement may be used to provide
access to clustered lots and/or structures.

§ 154.142 CO-LOCATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Public property first.
      (1)   In order to encourage the location of wireless telecommunications
facilities on publicly-owned property, the Village shall undertake an
identification of publicly-owned properties that the Village determines are
suitable for such use. The Village shall regularly update such identification
and make the results of such identification available to the public.
      (2)   Persons locating wireless telecommunications facilities upon such
identified publicly-owned properties shall be exempted from the requirements
herein regarding the presentation of proof that co-location of facilities on
towers or structures owned by other persons or in other locations is not
available. However, persons locating wireless telecommunications facilities on
public-owned properties shall continue to be subject to the requirements
contained in division (B) below.
      (3)   In addition, persons locating wireless telecommunications
facilities on publicly-owned properties identified by the Village to be
suitable for such purposes shall be exempt from the requirements of
§§ 154.140(C)(4) and
154.141(A)(2).
   (B)   No new tower shall be constructed in the Village unless such tower is
capable of accommodating at least one additional wireless telecommunications
facility owned by other persons.
   (C)   A conditional use permit shall be issued only if there is not
technically suitable space reasonably available on an existing tower or
structure within the geographic area to be served. With the permit application,
the applicant shall list the location of every tower, building, or structure
within the search area that could support the proposed antenna. The applicant
must demonstrate that a technically suitable location is not reasonably
available on an existing tower, building or structure. If another communication
tower is technically suitable, applicant must show that it has offered to allow
the owner to co-locate an antenna on another tower within the Village owned by
applicant on reciprocal terms, and the offer was not accepted, or the other
tower is presumed to be reasonably available.
(Ord. 0-1711-99, passed 9-20-99)
§ 154.143 ABANDONMENT OF TOWER.
   (A)   All providers utilizing towers shall present a report to the Building
Official notifying him of any tower facility located in the Village whose use
will be discontinued and the date this use will cease. If at any time the use
of the facility is discontinued for 180 days, the Building Official may declare
the facility abandoned. (This excludes any dormancy period between construction
and the initial use of the facility). The facility's owner/operator will
receive written notice from the Building Official and be instructed to either
reactivate the facility's use within 180 days, or dismantle and remove the
facility. If reactivation or dismantling does not occur, the Village will
remove or will contract to have removed the facility and assess the owner/
operator the costs.
   (B)   The Village must provide the tower owner three months notice and an
opportunity to be heard before the Council before initiating such action. After
such notice has been provided, the Village shall have the authority to initiate
proceedings to either acquire the tower and any appurtenances attached thereto
at the then fair market value, or in the alternative, order the demolition of
the tower and all appurtenances.
   (C)   The Village shall provide the tower owner with the right to a public
hearing before Council, which public hearing shall follow the three month
notice. All interested parties shall be allowed an opportunity to be heard at
the public hearing.
   (D)   After a public hearing is held pursuant to
§ 154.143(C), the Council may order the acquisition or demolition of the tower.
The Village may require permittee and/or landowner to pay for all expenses
necessary to acquire or demolish the tower.

Zoning Code.
(Ord. 0-1711-99, passed 9-20-99)
§ 154.145 MISCELLANEOUS.
   (A)   Non-waiver. Nothing in this subchapter shall preclude the Village from
exercising any right or remedy it may have in law or equity to enforce the
terms and conditions of this subchapter.
   (B)   Severability. If any provision of this subchapter or the application
of any provision of this subchapter to any person is, to any extent, held
invalid or unenforceable by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction, the remainder
of this subchapter and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such holding. In case of such an event,
this subchapter and all of its remaining provisions shall, in all other
respects, continue to be effective. In the event the law invalidating such a
subchapter provision is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or is
otherwise changed so that the provision which had previously been held invalid
or unenforceable, no longer conflicts with the laws, rules or regulations then
in effect, the previously invalid or unenforceable provision shall return to
full force and effect.
   (C)   Performance bond.
      (1)   All tower owners shall purchase and maintain for the benefit of the
Village a performance bond to assure that the terms and conditions of this
subchapter are complied with, including repair and removal. The performance
bond shall be in a form approved by the Village Attorney and shall be in an
amount no less than 25% of the construction value of the towers as estimated by
the Village at the time of issuance of a building permit.
      (2)   The Village may draw upon the performance bond for recovery of any
costs or damages it incurs arising from a tower owner's violation of this
subchapter, or the abandonment or discontinuance of use of a tower.
      (3)   The requirement to maintain a performance bond under this
subsection shall cease only upon a written determination by the Village that
the maintenance of the bond is no longer necessary.
(Ord. 0-1711-99, passed 9-20-99)
ZONING APPEALS
§ 154.156 VARIANCES.
   The Village Council shall have the power to hear and decide appeals and
authorize such variances from the provisions or requirements of this chapter as
will not be contrary to the public interest. In authorizing a variance, the
Village Council may attach conditions and require such guarantee or bond as it
may deem necessary to assure compliance with the objectives of this chapter. On
appeal where there is unnecessary hardship, the Village Council may grant a
variance in the application of the provisions of the zoning chapter. If a
variance is requested from size or area requirements, the following factors
shall be examined:
   (A)   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return or whether there
can be a beneficial use of the property without the variance;
      (1)   Whether the variance is substantial;
      (2)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or adjoining properties suffer a "substantial detriment";
      (3)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services;
      (4)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction;
      (5)   Whether the problem can be solved by some manner other than the
granting of a variance;
      (6)   Whether the variance preserves the "spirit and intent" of the
zoning requirement and whether "substantial justice" would be done by granting
the variance.
      (7)   The Village Clerk shall provide applicants with the necessary forms
and procedures for bringing a variance request before the Village Council.
   (B)   Notification shall be given to owners of all properties lying (a)
within 100 feet of; (b) contiguous to; (c) directly across the street or alley
from the parcels seeking the variance at least 20 days before the public
hearing on the variance request. Council may, at its discretion, waive the 20-
day notification requirement and hold the public hearing on a variance request
before the required 20-day notification period has passed if signed waivers of
the 20-day notification requirement have been received at the Village offices
from all residential properties lying (a) within 100 feet of; (b) contiguous
to; (c) directly across the street or alley from the parcels seeking the
variance.

155.07   Enforcement
§ 155.01 PURPOSE; INTENT.
   (A)   During the construction process, soil is the most vulnerable to
erosion by wind and water. This eroded soil endangers water resources by
reducing water quality, and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish
and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and
ditches, and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing grading during
construction causes the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat, and to provide a healthy living environment for citizens of
the Village.
   (B)   As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard
persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment and promote the
public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design,
construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other activity which
disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in
the Village.
(Ord. O-1976-04, passed 2-23-04)
§ 155.02 DEFINITIONS.

   EROSION CONTROL. Measures that prevent erosion.
   EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN. A set of plans prepared by or under the
direction of a licensed professional engineer that provide specific measures
and sequencing to be used to control sediment and erosion on a development site
before, during and after construction.
   GRADING. Excavation or fill of material, including the resulting conditions
thereof.
   PERIMETER CONTROL. A barrier that prevents sediment from leaving a site
either by filtering sediment-laden runoff, or diverting it to a sediment trap
or basin.
   PHASING. Clearing a parcel of land in distinct phases, with the
stabilization of each phase before the clearing of the next.
   SEDIMENT CONTROL. Measures that prevent eroded sediment from leaving the
site.
   SITE. A parcel of land, or a contiguous combination thereof, where grading
work is performed as a single unified operation.
   SITE DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. A permit issued by the Village for the construction
or alteration of ground.
   STABILIZATION. The use of practices that prevent exposed soil from eroding.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The first land-disturbing activity associated with a
development, including land preparation such as clearing, grading and filling;
installation of streets and walkways; excavation for basements, footings, piers
or foundations; erection of temporary forms; and installation of accessory
buildings such as garages.
   WATERCOURSE. Any body of water, including, but not limited to lakes, ponds,
rivers, streams, and bodies of water within the Village.
   WATERWAY. A channel that directs surface runoff to a watercourse, or to the
public storm drain.

by the Village.
   (C)   Each application shall bear the name(s) and address(es) of the owner
or developer of the site, and of any consulting firm retained by the applicant
together with the name of the applicant’s principal contact at such firm, and
shall be accompanied by a filing fee.
   (D)   Each application shall include a statement that any land clearing,
construction, or development involving the movement of earth shall be in
accordance with an Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.
   (E)   Review and approval.
      (1)   The Village will review each application for a site development
permit to determine its conformance with the provisions of this local
regulation. Within 30 days after receiving an application, the Village shall,
in writing:
         (a)   Approve the permit application;
         (b)   Approve the permit application subject to such reasonable
conditions as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this

(Res. R-2628-20, passed 2-17-20)
§ 156.07 PROCEDURES FOR THE IDENTIFICATION, REVIEW AND DESIGNATION OF
INDIVIDUAL LANDMARKS AND HISTORIC DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Proposals to designate or expand historic districts or designate
historic landmarks may be initiated by the Historic Preservation Commission, a
property owner or by motion of the Village Council. Proposals initiated by
property owners or Council shall be referred to the Historic Preservation
Commission for recommendation and initiation of the formal designation process.
   (B)   The Commission must also determine if the property meets one or more
of the following criteria:
      (1)   Its character, interest or value as part of the development,
heritage or cultural characteristics of the Village, state or nation;
      (2)   Its location as a site of a significant historic event;
      (3)   Its identification with a person significant in our past;
      (4)   Its exemplification of the cultural, economic or social heritage of

      (8)   Its identification as the work of an architect or master builder
who work has influenced the Village, state or nation;
      (9)   Its potential to yield information important in prehistory or
history (archaeology).
   (C)   In making a new designation, the Commission shall take the following
action:
      (1)   The Commission shall notify the owner, by mail, of any proposal to
list their property. For the purpose of designation or expansion of a group or
district, notice shall be published once in the Village bulletin and shall be
mailed or otherwise distributed to each owner of real property located within
such group or district.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the owner's consent to designation, the Historic
Preservation Commission shall make a recommendation concerning the designation
of the property to the Planning Commission. Once the proposal to establish or
expand a preservation district or to designate an individual property or
structure as a historic landmark has been reviewed, the Historic Preservation
Commission shall schedule a public hearing. The public hearing shall not be
more than 30 days after such a proposal is submitted. Notice of the public
hearing shall be given according to the following:
         (a)   The HPC shall give the owner(s) not less than 14 days' written
notice of the date, time and place of such hearing.
         (b)   Notice of the public hearing shall be given to at least one or
more newspapers of general circulation in the Village. The notice shall be
published at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
         (c)   Notices shall include the time and place of the public hearing,
a summary of the proposal and a statement that opportunity to be heard will be
afforded to any person interested. Failure of delivery of such notice shall not
invalidate any such amendment.
         (d)   The original application, all comments and additional
considerations presented at the public hearing, and the recommendation of the
HPC shall be forwarded to the Planning Commission for its consideration.
      (3)   If the owner of individual properties refuses or declines to give
their written consent to a proposed listing, and the Commission feels it is of
considerable importance to the community that the property be listed, then the
following procedure shall be followed, which shall also be the procedure
followed in the designation of all historic districts:
         (a)   The Commission shall transmit to Village Council and the
Planning Commission its recommendations, in writing, for the creation of a
historic district or the listing of any landmark.
         (b)   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the
proposed designation or listing.
         (c)   After receiving recommendations concerning the proposed
designation or listing from the Historic Preservation Commission and the
Planning Commission, and before making a decision on the designation or
listing, Village Council shall hold a public hearing. Village Council shall
give due consideration to recommendations of the Historic Preservation
Commission and the Planning Commission, as well as such views as are expressed
by persons participating in the hearings before such Commissions, in making its
determination with respect to the proposed designation. Village Council must
act on the proposed designation within 45 days after the public hearing.
Village Council may designate a landmark or a historic district at any regular
or special meeting of Village Council.
         (d)   If Village Council approves the listing of a property or
designation of a historic district, the Commission shall notify the owner of
such decision. If the proposed designation is disapproved by Village Council,
the Commission may, after a period of 60 days, resubmit the proposal to Village
Council for reconsideration.
      (4)   Once Council decides on landmark or historic district designation,
the Historic Preservation Commission shall notify the Building Inspector and
relevant Village offices of the official designation. The Director of Planning
shall cause the historic district or historic landmark designation to be shown
upon the official zoning maps as an overlay without changing the underlying
zoning. Whenever there is conflict between regulation of the zoning district
and the regulations of the historic district, the more restrictive shall apply.
      (5)   No application for demolition or alteration may be approved while
an application for designation is before the Historic Preservation Commission,
Planning Commission, or Village Council.
(Res. R-2628-20, passed 2-17-20)
§ 156.08 PROCEDURES FOR REVIEWING PROPOSED ALTERATIONS TO DESIGNATED RESOURCES.
   (A)   No person owning, renting, or occupying property which has been
designated a landmark or which is situated in a designated historic district
shall make any change in the environment of such property or the exterior
architectural feature of any building on such property without the consent of
the Historic Preservation Commission. The following procedures shall apply to
all alterations, demolitions, removals or constructions of such properties in
the Village.
   (B)   No certificate of zoning compliance, building permit, and/or other
appropriate permits shall be issued for any construction, reconstruction,
demolition, relocation, or other exterior alteration to a structure or site
element designated as, or upon, a landmark or located within a historic
district unless a certificate of appropriateness has been issued.
   (C)   Any application to the Building Inspector for a building permit for
any change in the environment or the exterior of a building shall be forwarded
to the Commission, together with copies of all detailed plans, designs,
elevations, specifications and documents relating thereto, within seven days
after receipt thereof. An application may be filed by the applicant directly
with the Commission at the same time that an application for a building permit
is filed or in lieu of filing for a building permit if no building permit is
required for the proposed change.
   (D)   An application will be approved if it will remedy conditions
imminently dangerous to life, health or property as determined in writing by
the Building Inspector or the Division of Fire or the Department of Public
Health.
   (E)   Application contents. An application for a certificate of
appropriateness shall contain the following, as applicable:
      (1)   A completed application to the Historic Preservation Commission;
      (2)   A complete detailed description of the proposed alteration,
construction, demolition, removal, or other external change to structures or
site elements;
      (3)   A plot plan, legibly drawn and to scale, indicating all existing
and proposed structures, drives, walks, signs, and other significant features;
      (4)   A description or sample of materials to be used in the proposed
project;
      (5)   Sketches, photographs and other illustrative material relevant to
the proposed project;
      (6)   Any additional information as is deemed necessary to review the
application by the Commission.
   (F)   The application shall be heard at a public Commission meeting. The
applicant, or his or her representative or agent, is encouraged to be present
at the meeting at which action on the request is to occur.
   (G)   Members of the Commission may inspect construction sites up to the
time of an acceptable form of Substantial Completion Form has been submitted by
the contractor to the owner. During this period any variance from the approved
construction shall be reported to the Building Inspector, who, if directed, has
the power to stop construction and/or levy fines until the variance is
corrected.
   (H)   In making such a determination, the Commission shall refer to the
below standards and to design guidelines adopted by the Commission.
      (1)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
      (2)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
      (3)   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
      (4)   Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired
historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
      (5)   Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be
preserved.
      (6)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or
pictorial evidence.
      (7)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
      (8)   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be
protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
      (9)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
      (10)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (I)   Design criteria. The following design criteria shall apply to all
buildings, site elements, structures and property designated as landmarks or
within a historic district:
      (1)   Traditional building materials such as wood, brick, metal, or stone
shall be used for construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration, or other
exterior structure or site element change. Modern man-made materials may be
utilized at the discretion of the Commission if the proposed project keeps in
character with the existing building, site, area structures, and any applicable
design guidelines.
      (2)   For new construction and additions, the structure's width, height,
surrounding setbacks and style shall be considered in relationship to adjacent
structures. This relationship between structures shall allow for consistency of
style, size and density in each given neighborhood area.
      (3)   Where possible, elements which can contribute to the quality of the
pedestrian environment and other public amenities should be promoted. Included
among these may be benches, water features, seating areas, arcades, awnings or
canopies.
      (4)   Signage shall be proportionally scaled and appropriately designed
to coalesce with the subject building, site and area.
   (J)   Following its review, the Historic Preservation Commission shall
either:
      (1)   Approve the certificate of appropriateness as submitted;
      (2)   Approve the certificate of appropriateness subject to specific
conditions; or
      (3)   Deny the certificate of appropriateness. If the Commission shall
disapprove the application they will advise the applicant in writing and the
Building Inspector in writing within 60 days after receiving the application.
   (K)   If no action is taken within 60 days from the date of application, the
certificate of appropriateness shall be issued as a matter of law. This
provision shall not apply if the application is tabled due to lack of
information provided by the applicant, or due to the applicant requesting that
the application remain tabled.
   (L)   A certificate of appropriateness shall be conditional upon the
commencement of work within one year of issuance. If work has not commenced
within one year of issuance or work has not been more than 50% completed within
one and one-half years of issuance, the certificate shall expire and be
revoked.
(Res. R-2628-20, passed 2-17-20)
§ 156.09 PROCEDURES FOR REVIEWING PROPOSED DEMOLITIONS OF DESIGNATED RESOURCES.
   (A)   In addition to the above procedures, if an application for a
certificate of appropriateness seeks approval of demolition, the Commission may
delay determination of the application for a period of 180 days upon a finding
that the structure is of such importance that alternatives to demolition may be
feasible and should be actively pursued by both the applicant and the
Commission. In the event that action on an application is delayed as provided
herein, the Commission may take such steps as it deems necessary to preserve
the structure in accordance with the purposes of this chapter. Such steps may
include but are not limited to, consultation with civic groups, public
agencies, and interested citizens, marketing plans, recommendation for
acquisition of the property by public or private bodies or agencies, and
exploration of the possibility of moving the structure or structures.
   (B)   Before a certificate of appropriateness is issued for demolition, the
applicant shall provide information concerning proposed redevelopment of the
site and the Commission shall review such proposal for compliance with the
above standards and any applicable design guidelines.
   (C)   Applications for the demolition of a structure shall also include:
      (1)   Current photographic documentation of the structure, inside and
out, showing existing conditions;
      (2)   A written evaluation of the structure's current condition and the
cause of such structures state of disrepair, as applicable;
      (3)   A written statement outlining the reasons for demolition,
alternatives to demolition that have been considered;
      (4)   Architectural plans for proposed new construction on the site or
reconstruction of the structure, as applicable;
      (5)   Any additional information as is deemed necessary to review the
application by the Commission.
   (D)   All demolitions must be approved by the Village Council as required by
§
154.062.
(Res. R-2628-20, passed 2-17-20)
§ 156.10 MINIMUM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   Neither the owner of nor the person in charge of a structure within a
historic district or of a designated landmark shall permit such structure or
landmark to fall into a state of disrepair which may result in the
deterioration of any exterior appurtenance or architectural feature so as to
produce or tend to produce, in the judgment of the Historic Preservation
Commission, a detrimental effect upon the character of the district as a whole
or the life and character of the landmark or structure in question, including
but not limited to:
      (1)   The deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports;
      (2)   The deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members;
      (3)   The deterioration of exterior chimneys;
      (4)   The deterioration or crumbling of exterior plaster or mortar;
      (5)   The ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs and
foundations, including broken windows or doors;
      (6)   The deterioration of any feature, so as to create or permit the
creation of any hazardous or unsafe condition or conditions.
   (B)   The provisions above shall be in addition to all other applicable
provisions of the Village Building Code.
   (C)   The Commission, on its own initiative, may file a petition with
Village Council, requesting that the Village proceed to take action against any
owner who, in the opinion of the Commission, is in violation of this Historic
Preservation Code.
(Res. R-2628-20, passed 2-17-20)
§ 156.11 ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.
   (A)   If preservation of a historic property may result in substantial
economic hardship, the applicant may submit evidence for consideration by the
Historic Preservation Commission. Substantial economic hardship does not
include an applicant's inability to maximize the return on his or her
investment. Deterioration of a historic property due to neglect by its owner
does not create the basis for a finding of substantial economic hardship.
   (B)   The Commission shall consider the following criteria to determine the
existence of substantial economic hardship:
      (1)   Denial of a certificate will result in a substantial reduction in
the economic value of the property;
      (2)   Denial of a certificate will result in a substantial economic
burden on the applicant because the applicant cannot reasonably maintain the
property in its current form;
      (3)   No reasonable alternative exists consistent with the architectural
standards and guidelines for the property;
      (4)   The owner has been unable to sell the property using best efforts.
   (C)   Documentation of economic hardship. To prove economic hardship, the
applicant shall submit sufficient information to enable the Commission to make
an accurate assessment of economic conditions affecting the application. In
considering cases of economic hardship, the Commission may solicit expert
testimony or request that the applicant submit any items it needs, including
but not limited to the items below. The level of documentation may vary as
appropriate to each case; however, the Commission's assessment shall be based
solely on the property's economic fundamentals and not the financial capacity
of the owner.
   (D)   Alternative uses and the economic return they will earn in relation to
the following:
      (1)   Estimate of the cost of the proposed redevelopment, alteration,
demolition or removal and an estimate of any additional cost that would be
incurred to comply with the recommendations of the Commission for changes
necessary for the continued use of the property and the issuance of a
certificate of appropriateness;
      (2)   A report from a licensed engineer or architect with experience in
rehabilitation as to the structural soundness of any buildings on the property
and their suitability for rehabilitation including any existing evidence that
deterioration has progressed to the extent that rehabilitation is not
practical;
      (3)   Estimated market value of the property in its current condition;
after completion of the proposed redevelopment, alteration, demolition or
removal; and after changes recommended by the Commission for the renovation of
the existing property for continued use;
      (4)   Testimony from a third party architect, developer, appraiser or
other real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic
feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of existing buildings on the property
taking into consideration any existing evidence that deterioration has
progressed to the extent that rehabilitation is not practical.
   (E)   The current economic return on the property in relation to the
following:
      (1)   The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase, and the
party from whom purchased, including a description of the relationship, if any,
between the owner of record or applicant and the person from whom the historic
property was purchased;
      (2)   If the property is income-producing, the annual gross income from
the property for the previous two years; itemized operating and maintenance
